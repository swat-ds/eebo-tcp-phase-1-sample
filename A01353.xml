            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The Prologue.
            
               CIcero in his book de amicitia these woords dooth expresse,
            Saying nothing is more desirous then like is vnto like:
            Whose woords are most true and of a certainty doubtles,
            For the vertuous doo not the vertuous company mislike.
            But the vicious dooth the vertuous company eschue:
            And like wil vnto like this is most true.
            It is not my meaning your eares for to wery,
            with harkning what is the effect of our matter:
            But our pretence is to mooue you to be mery,
            Merily to speak meaning no man to flatter.
            The name of this matter as I said while ere,
            is like wil to like quod the Deuil to the Collier.
            Sith pithie prouerbs in our English sung doo abound,
            Our author thought good such a one for to chuse:
            As may shew good example and mirth may eke bé found,
            But no lasciuious toyes he purposeth to vse,
            Heerin as it were in a glasse see you may:
            the aduauncement of vertue and of vice the decay,
            To what ruin ruffins and roisters are brought,
            You may heer see of them the finall end:
            Begging is the best though that end be naught.
            But hanging is woorse if they doo not amend.
            The vertuous life is brought to honor and dignitie:
            And at the last to euerlasting eternitie.
            And because diuers men of diuers mindes be,
            Some doo matters of mirth and pastime require:
            Other some are delighted with matters of grauitie.
            to please all men is our authors cheef desire.
            Wherfore mirth with mesure to sadnes is annexed,
            Desiring that none heer at our matter wil be parplexed.
            Thus as I said I wil be short and breef,
            Because that from this dump you shall reléeued be:
            
               And the Deuil with the Colier, the theef that seeks the theef,
            Shall soon make you merry as shortly you shall see.
            And sith mirth for sadnes is a sauce most sweet:
            take mirth then with measure that best sauceth it.

               Stoup gentle knaue and take vp your brother.
               VVhy is it so? and is it euen so indeed?
               Why then may I say God send vs good speed,
               And is euery one heer so greatly vnkinde,
               that I am no sooner out of sight but quite out of minde.
               Mary this wil make a man euen weep for woe,
               that on such a sodain no man wil him knowe.
               Though men be so dangerous now at this day,
               Yet are women kinde woorms I dare wel say.
               How say you woman you that stand in the Angle,
               were you neuer acquainted with Nichol newfangle?
               Then I see Nichol newfangle is quite forgot,
               Yet you wil know me anon, I dare ieopard a grote.
               Nichol newfangle is my name, doo you me not knowe?
               my whole education to you I wil showe,
               For first before I was born I remember very well,
               that my gransier and I made a iourney into hell.
               Where I was bound prentice before my natiuitie,
               to Lucifer himself such was mine agilitie.
               All kinde of sciences he taught vnto me,
               that to the maintenance of pride might best agree.
               I learned to make gowns with long sleeues and winges:
               I learned to make ruffs like Calues chitterlings.
               Caps, Hats, Cotes, and all kinde of apparails,
               
                  And especially Breethes as big as good barrels.
               Shoos, Boots, Buskins, with many prity toyes,
               All kinde of garments for men, women and boyes.
               Know ye me not now I thought that at the last,
               All acquaintance from Nichol newfangle is not past.
               Nichol newfangle was and is and euer shalbe,
               And there are but few that are not acquainted with me.
               For so soon as my prentishood was once come out,
               I went by and by the whole world about.
               Heer the Deuil entreth but speaketh not yet.

               Body of me it were best goe no neere,
               For ought that I see it is my Godfather Lucifer.
               Whose prentice I haue been this many a day,
               But no more woords but mum, you shall heare what he wil say

               This hole in thy fury didst thou disclose:
               that now may a tent be put in as big as thy nose.

               ¶ It should appeere by your sayings yt we are of one minde,
               For I knowe that roisters and tospots come of one kinde.
               And as our names be much of one accord and much like,
               So I think our condicions be not far vnlike.

               ¶ Few woords are best among freends this is true,
               Wherfore I shall breefly shew my name vnto you.
               Tom tospot it is, it need not be painted,
               Wherfore with Rafe Roister I must needs be acquainted.

               ¶ In faith Rafe Roister if thou wilt be ruled by me,
               we wil daunce hand in hand like knaues all three.
               It is as vnpossible for thée his company to deny:
               As it is for a Cammel to creep through a needles eye.
               therfore did him welcome like a knaue as thou art,

               For the vertuous wil alwaies the vertuous company seek out:
               A Gentleman neuer seeketh the company of a Lout.
               And Roisters and Ruffians do sober company eschue:
               For like wil euer to like this is moste true.

               And neither of our companies from other may be forborne.

               that if hel should be raked euen by and by indeed:

               Go to sirs say on your whole mindes:
               And I shall paint you out in your right kindes.
               First tom tospot plead thou thy cause and thy name:
               And I wil sit in this chaire and giue sentence on the same.
               I will play the Iudge and in this matter giue iudgement:
               How say you my maisters are you so content?

               T.Tos.
               ¶ I were to blame if any fault should be in me.
            
            
               Newfan.
               ¶ Then that I be in office neither of you doo grudge?

               Newfan.
               ¶ Where learned you to stand capt before a Iudge?
               You sowterly knaues, shew you all your manners at once.

               How little we haue Gods threats in feare?
               When this is spoken he must pause and then say as followeth.
               Saint Augustine saith in his 5. book de ciuitate Dei,
               
               
                  Coniuncta sunt edes Vertutis et honoris (saith he)
               The house of Vertue and Honour ioyned togither be.
               And so the way to Honours house is disposed,
               that through vertues house he must needs passe:
               Or else from honour he shall soone be deposed,
               and brought to that point that he before was.
               But if through vertue honour be attained:
               The path to saluation may soon be gained.
               Some there be that doo fortune prefer,
               Some esteem plesure more then vertuous life:
               But in mine opinion all such doo erre,
               For vertue and fortune be not at strife.
               Where vertue is, fortune must needs growe:
               But fortune without vertue hath soon the ouerthrowe.
               Thrise happy are they that doo vertue imbrace,
               For a Crowne of glory shall be their rewarde:

               For God ouer him wil haue such regarde.
               That his foes he shall soon tread vnder his foot:
               And by Gods permission, pluck them vp by the root.
               It booteth not vice against vertue to stur,
               For why vice is feeble and of no force:
               But Vi

               wherfore I would all men would haue a remorse.
               And eschue euil company vile and pernicious.
               And as the end of vertue is honour and felicitie,
               So mark wel the end of wickednes and vice:
               Shame in 
                     •

                  VVherfore you that are heere learn to be wise.
               And the end of the one, with the other waye:
               By that tune you haue heard the end of this play.
               But why doo I thus much say in the praise of Vertue?
               Sith the thing praise woorthy need no praise at all:
               It praiseth it self sufficiently this is true,
               VVhich chaseth away sinne as bitter as gall.
               And where Vertue is, it need not to be praised:
               For the renowne therof shall soon be raised. Intrat good fame

               This is good thrift learn it who shall:
               And now a couple of felowes, are come from cutpurse hall.
               And there haue they brought many a purse to wrack:
               Loe heerts geer that wil make their necks to crack.

               Now the house is stolen I shut the stable doore,
               Alas that I had time my life to amend.
               Time I haue I must needs confesse,
               But yet in misery that time must be spent:
               Seeing that my life I would not redresse,
               But wholy in riot I haue it all spent.
               VVherfore I am now brought to this exigent.
               But the time past cannot be called again this is no nay,
               Wherfore all you heere take example by me:
               Time tarieth no man but passeth stil away,
               take time while time is for time dooth flee:
               Vse wel your youthfull yeeres and to vertues

                  ore agree.
               
                  For if I to vertue had any respect,
               this misfortune to me could not haue chaunced:
               But because vnto vice I was a subiect;
               to no good fame may I now be aduaunced.
               My credit also is now quite staunched.
               Wherfore I would all men my wofull case might see:
               that I to them a mirrour might be.

               And now it is too late, I cannot again begin.

               For like wil to like quoth the Deuil to the Collier.
            
            
               Newfan.
               ¶ Now farwel Hankin hangman, farwel to thee:
            
            
               H.hang.
               ¶ Farwel Nichol newfangle come you two with me.
            
            Hankin goeth out and leadeth the one in his right hand, and the other in his left, hauing halters about their necks.
            
               Newfang.
               ¶ Ha, ha, ha, there is a brace of hounds wel woorth a dozen Crowns
               beholde the huntsman leadeth away:
               I think in twenty towns, on hills and eke on downs,
               they taken haue their pray.
               So well liked was their hunting on hill and eke on mountain.
               that now they be vp in a leace:
               To keep within a string it is now a gay thing,
               doo all you holde your peace.
               Why then good gentle boy, how likest thou this play?
               no more but say thy minde:
               I swere by this day, if thou wilt this assay,
               I wil to thee be kinde.
               This is wel brought to passe of me I swere by the masse,
               some to hang and other some to beg:
               I would I had Balams asse to cary me where I was,
               how say you little Mec.
               Rafe roister and Tom tospot are not now woorth a grote,
               So wel with them it is:
               I would I had a pot for now I am so whot,

               Philip fleming and Haunce hath daunst a prity daunce,
               
                  that all is now spent out:
               And now a great mischaunce came on while they did praunce,
               they lye sick of the gout.
               And in a spittle house, with little Laurence louse,
               they be fame to dwell:
               if they eate a morsel of souce, or els a rosted mouce,
               they think they doo fare well.
               But as for pierce pickpurse, and cutbert cutpurse,
               you saw them both right now:
               with them it is much wurse, for they doo ban and curse,
               for the halter shall them bow.
               Now if I had my nag, to see the world wag.
               I would straight ride about:
               Ginks doo fil the bag, I would not passe a rag,
               to hit you on the snout.

               Lucifer.
               ¶ Ho, ho, ho, mine own boy make no more delay,
               But leap vpon my back straight way.
            
            
               Newfan.
               ¶ Then who shall holde my stirrop while I goe to horse?
            
            
               Lucifer.
               ¶ Tush for that doo thou not force,
               Leap vp I say, leap vp quickly.
            
            
               Ni.New.
               ¶ VVho ball who, and I will come by and by.
               Now for a paire of spurs I would giue a good grote:
               to try whether the iade dooth amble or trot.
               Farwel my maisters til I come again:
               For now I must make a iourney into Spaine.

               WHere like to like is matched so,
               that vertue must of force decay:
               There God with vengeance, plagues and woe,
               by iudgement iust must néeds repay.
               For like to like the worldlings cry:
               Although both like doo grace defye.
            
            
               ¶ And where as Sathan planted hath,

               and like to like doo run their race.
               Like Christe like harts of Christian men:
               As like to like wel coupled then.

               A holy God, a Christe most iust:
               And so like soules in him to trust.

               in peace, and ioy, and endles rest.
               If we our selues like him doo frame:
               In feare of his most holy hame.
