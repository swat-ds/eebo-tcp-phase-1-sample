            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               THe holy Prophet Dauid, in a thankfull commemoration of the in▪ numerable blessings, hee had receiued from the hands of God, said, Quid retribuam domino? what reward shall I giue vnto the Lord, for all the

benefits hee hath done vnto me, and apprehending that God was not so well pleased with ceremoniall sacrifices, as thousands of oblations, or whole streames of the blood of young bullockes or goates, or with riuers of oyle; as with Psal. 51. a troubled Spirit, and a contrite and a broken heart; resolueth therefore to humble his soule with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning, to seeke the face and fauour of the Lord, to pay his vowes, to pray vnto the Lord, to cal vpon his holy name, &amp; to praise him for euermore, assuring himselfe that the Lord would neither reiect nor despise such a sacrifice.
            Good Christian Reader doe thou the like, which art

as farre indebted as euer Dauid was. And seeing that Iesus Christ himselfe calleth vnto thee, saying. Come vnto mee all you that labour and are heauy laden with the burden of your sinnes, and I will refresh you: Oh 
                  •
               et thy resolution be as ready as Dauids was when the Lord called, seeke my face, hee answered, thy face O Lord will I seeke, euen with my whole heart: so let thy answere bee to the Sonne of God, I come Lord Iesus, I come, I will pay my vowes promised to thee in the presence of thy people, and confirmed vnder the Sacramentall Seale of Baptisme, thy couenant of grace and mercy; I will come and offer vnto thee my heart, I will come and praise thee for all

thy benefits, I will come and hearken to thy voyce in thy most holy and blessed word, I will abandon all secure, licentious, and voluptuous liuing, and wholly delight in thy Testimonies and in thy Commandements which are not grieuous to thy children, but more pleasing then honey, or the honey combe, and more inualuable then all earthly treasure. I will come with reuerence, repentance, Charitie and Faith to receiue the cuppe of saluation at thy holy table in remembrance of thy most precious (and for my sinnes sake ignominious) death.
            And forasmuch as the Math. 26 Spirit is willing, but the flesh fraile and weake, pray

therefore for mortification of the flesh, and that Sanctification and strengthening of thine owne inward Spirit: oh pray for the presence and assistance of Gods most holy Spirit to 1. Cor. 14. helpe and strengthen thine infirmities: whereby the diligent sighes &amp; inward groanes of thy heart may cheerefully ascend and pierce the heauens for a blessing: oh stirre vp thy Math. 5. Acts 10. heart and soule to pray earnestly, offer vp thyteares with watching, with almes-deedes, with abstinence and fasting, as the repentant Niniuites: as Iona. 3. 
               Dauid, as Daniel; oh breath out powerful sighes with Hannah, oh streame out riuers of teares with penitent Mary Magdalen. As some kinde of deuils could not bee cast out

but by prayer and fasting; so some sins are not eiected, nor pardon for them procured without prayer and fasting, and also bitter teares with repenting Peter.
            
            Oh pray effectually and cheerefully, and giue thy selfe 1. Thess. 5 continually to this diuine and holy exercise, (for this is the alone meanes to haue heauenly conference with thy gracious God) oh pray without ceasing as the widow, and as the importunate woman of Canaan: pray euery where, though it be in the vppenpart of thy house with Peter, or in thy chamber alone with Eliseus; whether in the Kings Actes 10. chamber, or in the Lyons den with Daniel, or with Moses in Daniel. 6. the wildernesse: the blessed

children prayed in the fiery furnace, King Hezekias in his bed, Ionahs in the whales belley, and our Sauiour Christ in the fields, in the gardens, on the mountaine; euen vpon the Crosse at the time of his victorious passion: pray with Dauid either seauen times a day, and in the night let thine eyes (like his) gush out riuers of teares, or with Daniel thrice in the day, or with Paul continually be exercised with holy sighes and sacred meditations: let not, oh let not the dulnesse of thine heart, nor the greatnesse or grieuousnesse of thy sinnes hinder thee from this holy exercise, suffer not the Spirit of God to bee quenched in thee. To thee that art heauy laden with sin,

and pressed with afflictions for sinne, doth thy sweet Sauiour call, to thee doth his promise most properly appertaine, none asketh but he that wanteth, none seeketh but he that hath lost, remember that our Sauiour came to call sinners to repentance, and to heale the sicke, and to cure the wounded, to ease and refresh all such as are laden with the insupportable burthen of their sinnes! oh bee of good comfort, striue against thy dulnes, heare what is written for thy consolation; whosoeuer shall faithfully call vpon the Lord, shall be saued.
            Let not thy afflictions hinder thee, but rather follow the exhortation of the Apostle; if any bee afflicted let

him pray, let thine afflictions encourage thee, and enflame thine heart to call vpon thy mercifull God who promiseth by his Prophet to heare thee, and to deliuer thee. You shall seeke mee saith the Lord and finde mee, because you shall seeke mee with all your heart, and I will bee found of you &amp; will deliuer you from captiuity; Aske therefore and you shall haue, seeke and you shall finde, knocke and it shall bee opened vnto you: oh marke &amp; firmely beleeue the gracious promise of him that is the truth and the life, whatsoeuer you shall aske the Father in my name you shall receiue it: who was euer denied that faithfully called vpon the Lord? The Lord is true and

faithfull of his promise, both able and willing to performe, and will regard the supplications, and accept the prayers of his children; did not the Lord heare the prayers of the Israelites, and did not hee with a mighty arme plague their enemies, and deliuer them out of captiuity and bondage: did not the red sea recoyle backe at the prayer of Moses; yea the waters saw thee ô Lord and were afraid, and at thy appointment made a way for the safety and deliuerance of thy people: was not the plague in the wildernesse stayed at the prayer of Moses, was not Miriam by prayer cleansed from his leprosie, was not Hanna by prayer of a barren woman made fruitfull, did not

               Dauid by his faithfull prayer and repentance obtaine remission and forgiuenesse for man-slaughter and adulterie, did not Elias by prayer open the windowes of heauen and brought downe plentie of raine, was it not by prayer that Sennacherib &amp; his innumerable hoast were slaine &amp; discomfited, by the Angel of the Lord. By prayer Susanna was deliuered frō death, the blessed children from the scorching heat of the Ouen, Queen Hester and her people were deliuered from death, Ionas out of the belley of the Whale; by prayer Leapers were cleansed, the blind were restored to sight, the Palsies were cured, many men &amp; womē obtained health fortheir children &amp; seruants.
            
               
By prayer the lame haue beene restored to their limbs, the deafe to hearing, the blind to their sight, and the dumbe to their speech, by prayer remission of sinnes was obtained, and the holy Ghost was sent downe vpon the Apostles.
            What should I saye more, by prayer Kingdomes haue beene subdued, miracles haue beene wrought, the promises were obtained, the mouthes of Lyons were stopped, the violence of fire hath beene quenched, the heauens haue beene shut and opened, the dead hath beene raised to life, the Sunne and Moone haue beene commanded and stood still. O faithfull messenger, oh diuine prayer, thou

wilt striue and preuaile euen with the Lord of heauen, and obtaine the blessing.
            Wherefore good Christian and faithfull Reader, be feruent and constant in this holy exercise. Remember that when Moses hands failed, the enemies of Gods children preuailed; and that Sampson lost his strength and glory, when he lost his haire by the treachery of Dalilah: so when thou sufferest Gods Spirit to be quenched, thou art depriued of thy spirituall strength and heauenly glory, and her soule despoiled of her beauty and comelinesse, and thou exiled from the protection of the most glorious Angels, which are ready with all chearefull willingnesse to administer

their aide and comfort vnto thee, and to beare thee safe from all thy enemies and dangers, while thou by faithfull prayer doest in the name of the Angel of the Couenant that doeth sweetely and acceptably incense all thy oblations, call vpon the name of the most mighty and most glorious God of all Archangels and men.
            And for that experience of my long afflictions and sorrowes haue made mee apprehensiue of the hardnes of our hearts, and our dulnesse and vnaptnesse to call vpon God in the time of our troubles. I haue composed these sorrowfull sighes, prayers and meditations, which I may well call the exercises of my sad affections;

to the end that if through Sathans buffets, the distemperature or weakenes of my corrupt nature, or the snares of euill men my poore heart should be ouerwhelmed; yet I might haue alwayes presented to mine eye how to make my moane vnto my God.
            And intending to publicke my labour herein, I haue endeauoured by varietie of meditations and prayers to make it profitably vsefull for all men. Most humbly beseeching the God of mercy to accept and blesse my endeauoure herein: and grant that some glory to his holy name, and some benefite to his ch
                  •
               ldren, and comfort and consolation to all that groane vnder the burden of sinne, may redound

hereby, and that for the alone merits and mediation of Iesus Christ the righteous. To whom with the father and the most holy Spirit, as by the most glorious Angels in heauen, so by vs men, be rendred Halleluiah: all the glory, the praise, and the honour for euer more. Amen. Amen.

               Repent with speede, thy sinfull life. Begin

            ALmighty God and heauenly Father, I make my prayer vnto thee in an acceptable time: calling most faithfully and feruently vpon thee, in the name and mediation of my Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, thy well beloued Sonne, in whom thou art well pleased: trusting that for his sake, and for the multitude of thy mercies, thou wilt heare me, and grant my petitions may be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my strength, and my saluation.
            Almighty, immortall, and invisible God; who inhabitest eternitie, and dwellest in light that none can attaine vnto, whom neuer man saw, neither can see (as thou art

in thy eternall glory with this eye of flesh and liue;) vnto thee (oh Lord God) doe I prostrate and direct my selfe, most humbly confessing that I am but dust and ashes, not worthy to open my lippes to speake vnto thee, or once with my eyes to looke vp to thy heauens, to behold thy glory in thy wonderfull workes: for (oh Lord) I haue sinned against heauen, and against thee, and am not worthy to bee counted or called thy Sonne, being by nature the child of wrath, &amp; a fire-brand of hell, altogether both in body and soule: begotten, conceiued and brought foorth in sinne, and have euer since my first originall, liued and continued therein, adding sinne vnto sinne, and heaping vp transgression, vpon transgression, and drinking in iniquitie as the beast doth water: so that (oh my Lord God) if thou shouldest but behold mee with thy pure eyes, that can abide no iniquite;

thou mightest not onely punish and afflict me with diuers crosses, with sundry paines, sicknesse and diseases in this mortall life: but (O Lord) thou mightest, follow and pursue mee with thy secret hatred, with thy infinite and eternall displeasure: yea and for euer giue me my part &amp; portion with the wicked reprobates, and damned spirits in infernall darkenesse. But (oh Lord) though by nature and desert, hell be my portion; yet thou hast pleased for Christ his sake, in whom alone I beleeue the pardon of all my sinnes, originall and actuall; of omission, and commission; of ignorance, and knowledge, and of presumption: in all which kindes I haue mightily offended thee, mine owne conscience (beside the testimony of thy word) bearing witnesse, which is greater then if ten thousands of witnesses should stand vp against me: But (ô Lord) for thy Christ his sake that immaculate and vnspotted

Let thy Spirit dwell in me, and testifie vnto▪ and with my Spirit this day, the assurance of my Iustification and adoption.
            O Lord sanctifie and regenerate mee to thy Image, through thy holy Spirit, from whence through Adams sinne, and my owne actuall, I am fallen, &amp; should for euer lye plunged therein, if

thou Lord shuldest denie to reach foorth vnto mee thy mercifull hand, or thy hand full of mercy, and aboundant kindnesse in Christ.
            O Lord, if when we were dead in sinnes and trespasses, and (inasmuch as in vs lay) thy most malicious enemies, when wee were without God, and without hope in the world, and sought not after thee, till thou (as to Adam in the garden) didst seeke and finde vs out. How much more beeing in Christ, and in him seeking thee, wilt thou be found of vs, and nigh vnto vs, when wee call vpon thee.
            O Lord thou hast promised, that if wee aske wee shall haue, if we seeke we shall finde, if wee knocke it shall bee opened vnto vs; wherefore I beseech thee pardon my weake Faith, O Lord, encrease in me godly sorrow, for all my offences past and present, ô let mee sorrow that I cannot sorrow

            Lord keepe me this day, that I may not like Lots wife looke back again, or like the vnthankful Israelites, esteeme the homely fare of Egypt, (of this world of things of this life) aboue the heauenly Manna (thy word the only true food of life.) But like Abraham &amp; the rich Marchant, leaue &amp; sell all that this world can affoord, to attaine the Kingdome of heauen, vnto which thou hast called mee, by faith in

Christ, at this day, and for euer.
            Hauing begd these graces, I returne vnto thee humble thanks for all thy benefits that I haue receiued; not onely before, but since my being, as for my election before time, and for my vocation in time, from whence haue followed my iustification, and some measure of sanctification in this life, and my assured hope of glorification in the life to come.
            For these inestimable blessings, which no minde can conceiue, nor tongue expresse, I returne vnto thee, all such possible praise and hearty thankes as my vnderstanding can conceiue: beseeching thee that I may this day, &amp; all the dayes of my life, walke worthy of all these thy mercies. O Lord I thanke thee for these other inferiour testimonies of thy loue, which thou hast made more common with the vniust, then with the iust; I thanke thee ô Father that thou hast shared mee out so

great a portion, euen beyond many of thy Saints &amp; seruants; Lord grant that while thou continuest the trust of them in my hands (for they are thy talents and not mine) I may soberly vse them to thy glory, and to mine owne comfort, and the comfort of the Saints.
            O Lord grant I may abound in charitie to all of all sorts, that I shall behold to stand in neede of my helpe: but especially to the houshold of Faith: and grant that I may giue no reliefe in worldly ostentation, or vaine glory, to bee seene or talked of, of men, but in an vpright heart &amp; good conscience vnto thee. And all this I beseech thee to grant, for Iesus Christ his sake my onely Lord and Sauiour.
            Last of all, I beseech thee as a seeling member of thy holy Church militant, howsoeuer, or wheresoeuer dispersed, scattered, or afflicted; for all thine that suffer any

kinde of sorrow, neede, sicknesse, or any other aduersitie in soule, or body, by sea or land: but especially for all thine that suffer bonds, chaines or imprisonments, (with Ioseph) for righteousnesse sake, mittigate all their paines and troubles, and giue them Faith and patience in all their seueral distresses as may bee most for thine owne glory and their comforts; through Christ our Mediator and Redeemer. To thee ô Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, the eternall and most blessed Trinitie, bee rendred all praise and glory, not onely by all men in generall, but by me in speciall, with thy holy Church, this day and for euermore,
            Amen, Amen.

               from right to wrong, to ill from good:
               Whose end is death, though for a time,
               seemes sweete to please the outward man;
               Thats nothing else, but durt and slyme,
               or like a puffe, in length a span.
            
            
               As honour, riches, friends and health,
               Preferment, life, and Worlds delight;
               Esteeming these true happy wealth,
               but the true blisse is out of sight:
               They thinke that sicknes, pouerty,
               imprisonment and enemies fell;
               And worldly crosses verely,
               are gates and entrance into hell.
            
            
               So foolish and so ignorant,

               haue bin misled vntill this day:
               But hauing found the truth by triall,
               that earthly ioyes are transitory;
               When they me tempt I make deniall,

               Now I disclaime all confidence,

In wit or worldly Sapience,

               Because they all are most vntrue,
               and still doe cause so great offences:
               Because their glorious bounty fades,
               and leaues nought but deformities;
               Because they are nought else but shades,
               and bring forth grosse enormities.
            
            
               Because they are most false and fickle,
               because they are indeed hels fewell;
               Because their rose hath many a prickle,
               because their slauery is most cruell:
               Because they are not firme and stable,
               because they are profane, not holy;
               Because they are but as a fable,
               because they are but sottish folly.
            
            
               Because my soule they coll and kill,
               because they giue me Iudas kisse;
               
                  
Because my good they spot and spill,
               and draw me from mine heauenly wish:
               Because like swords they wound my soule,
               because like Serpents they doe sting mee;
               Because my conscience doth controule,
               and saith to hell gates they will bring mee.
            
            
               Because they doe besot my senses,
               because they dull my Spirits quicknes;
               Because they cause so great expenses,
               because they cause my sad soules sicknes:
               Because all vertue hindered is,
               by this vile worlds accursed pleasure;
               Because it will bereaue of blisse,
               and of that blessed heauenly treasure.
            
            
               And therefore earth and world farewell,
               adue fond fancies flattering fauours;

            O my God, my merciful God, I beseech thee in thy beloued Sonne, blesse me with the workes of mercy and zeale of godlinesse, to suffer with the afflicted, to minister to the needy, to succour the miserable, to counsell them that go astray, to comfort the sorrowfull, to releeue the oppressed, to nourish the poore, to cherish and comfort such as mourne, to forgiue my debtors, to pardon them

that trepasse against mee, to loue them that hate mee, to render good for euill, to despise none, but to honour them, to imitate the good, to beware of euill things, and euill vngodly societie, to eschew vice, and to embrace vertue; in aduersitie patience, humblenesse in prosperitie, to guard the doore of my mouth, to watch the enemies that compasse my lippes, to despise worldly things, and earnestly to thirst after the heauenly.
            O Lord my God, blessed be thy name for euer: dispose my heart, open my lippes, and guide mee by thy holy Spirit, to a true acknowledgement of all my sinnes, and an eternall detestation, renouncing and forsaking of them, that my prayers may bee heard of thee, in the name, and for the name of thy Sonne Iesus Christ. To whom with thee and the most holy Spirit, three sacred persons, one mighty and immortall God, bee

ascribed, attributed and giuen, all praise, all thankes, all honour and glory this day and for euermore.

            A generall confession of sinnes.
            
               OMnipotent, and gracious Father,
               I from thy wayes haue stray'd and err'd
               Like a lost sheepe, and followed rather,
               mine hearts deuises and prefer'd:
               My foolish fancies, fond desires,
               and broke the lawes set downe by thee;
               I haue not done what thou requires,
               but done those things that should not be.
            
            
               No health in mee, but thou, ô God,
               haue mercy on me sinfull wretch;
               Spare me, oh spare me, hold thy rod,
               that to offenders thou doest stretch:
               I doe confesse my faults, restore mee,
               I doe repent, (for Iesus sake;)
               That promise euer is before thee,
               which thou in Christ to God didst make,
            
            
               
               And grant for his sake liue I may,

            A Morning Meditation.
            
               I Laid me downe to rest and slept,
               and in the moring rose againe;
               God me sustain'd and safely kept,
               and by his grace did me maintaine:
               His Angels pitcht me round about,
               sleeping and waking keeping me;
               Both comming in and going out,
               they guard me with securitie.
            
            
               Lord heare my voyce in morning bright,
               when I my prayers doe direct;
               And waite till thou the God of light,
               doe heare and helpe me with effect:
               O Father full of power and might,
               mercy and loue. How dare I cast?
               
                  
Mine eyes vnto thy heauenly light;
               if thou remember my sinnes past.
            
            
               How can I thinke or hope for good,
               on me below to come from highe;
               Hauing so much thy lawes withstood,
               and sinn'd against thy Maiestie:
               Thou in thy power and knowledge deepe,
               Lord sees the wicked wayes of mine;
               Whether in sinne I wake or sleepe,
               It is not hidden from thine eyne.
            
            
               My vaine corrupt and euill deedes,
               my imperfections more and more;
               My daily sinnes, by which it breedes,
               thine anger worse then was before:
               Thy iudgements I might iustly feare,
               If thou shouldest note whats done amisse;
               Thou might'st in torture be seuere,
               yet giu'st th ou rest, and peace, and blisse.
            
            
               And hast raised me vp by thy hand,
               for onely thou preseruest mee;
               And me defendst by sea and land,
               awake, or sleepe (I seruing thee:)
               Whether I walke, worke, eate, or drinke,
               or what ere else, doe what I will;
               
                  
Thou blessest all that I can thinke,
               without thy blessings all were ill.
            
            
               For I a creature weake and faint,
               subiect to dangers that are rise;
               And closely worke my soule to taint,
               in this corrupt and euill life:
               I lye alas in night and blindnes,
               and haue no watch me to defend;
               Yet am preserued by thy kindnes,
               from them that ill to me intend,
            
            
               Whose owlish eyes doe shunne the light,
               who lay their traps and snares in darke;
               But thou defend'st me with thy might,
               and with bright eyes their worke dost marke:
               Thou deare kinde Father full of loue,
               regard'st thy weake and little ones;
               Thy many mercies doe thee mooue.
               to hearken to their sighes and mones.
            
            
               O gracious God I giue thee thankes,
               for all thy mercies manifold;
               Saue me from all the plots and prankes,
               of sinne, and of that Serpent old:
               Forgiue me mine offences Lord,
               let true repentance make me right,
               
                  
An humbled heart, and life reform'd,
               I know are pleasing in thy sight.
            
            
               I am inclin'd to vanitie,
               to fall into one sinne or other;
               No day nor houre from sinne scape I,
               since first conceiu'd in wombe of mother:
               With cruell foes I am beset,
               corruptions in me daily fight;
               They labour sore thy grace to let,
               and make me loathsome in thy fight.
            
            
               Wresting my will and setled minde,
               from true sinceritie to sinne;
               From good desires to be inclin'de,
               to deepe despaire, and die therein:
               To make me trust in blandishment,
               of wicked world my soule deceiuing,
               And in my soules sad languishment.
               of comforts all my soule bereauing.
            
            
               I flye vnto the sauctuary,
               of thy deare care and prouidence;
               Assured I shall not miscarry,
               when I depend on thy defence:
               Keepe me therefore ô King of Kings,

               Teach me the truth, me knowledge giue,
               and wisedome with all humblenesse;

And by Christs merits end the strife,

            A Morning Prayer to be said with a whole Family.
            MOst Mighty God, the Creator and Father of euery liuing thing, both in heauen, and in earth, the wonderfull preseruer, and constant vpholder of all things visible, and invisible; not onely in the dayes of our forefathers, but in these our times. Wee thy poore sinfull seruants, doe this morning prostrate and deiect our selues, in soule and

body, sorrowfully confessing vnto thee, against our selues, that wee are so loden with daily transgressions, that we know not, but with infinite shame, how to lift vp our heads and eyes towards thee, or once to open our mouths to speake vnto thee: for when wee remember how in the morning of this world, in the first beginning of mankind, thou didst make him after thine own Image, a glorious creature, and planted him in the Garden of Eden, where hee wanted nothing, but was filled with ioy and happy contentment.
            But he despised thy holy Commandement, aduenturing to doe that which thou hadst forbidden: whereby thou wast so displeased with him, that immediately didst banish him and our grandmother E

               steritie: then in their loynes, and vnto this day issuing and proceeding foorth, into perpetuall

blindnesse and ignorance of thee, and should so for euer haue remained from generation to generation, if wee did not beleeue in thy holy word and Gospell; in which is contained the happy and ioyfull tydings of thy euerlasting loue renewed vnto vs: as that in his seede all nations should bee blessed, meaning by his seede, the promised Messiah, which our first parents then beleeued in, for themselues, and so instructed vs their following posteritie for euer to doe the like.
            Wherefore, ô Lord, wee beleeuing in thyword (our Messiah) who in these latter dayes, hath taken our flesh, and in that nature, by which thou wast most mightily offended, hath againe reconciled vs vnto thee, and thee vnto vs, by paying that price of our Redemption, euen his most precious death &amp; blood; by vertue of which we first entreat thee, to par donour originall sins, and all other

offences which in knowledge against the motions of thy holy Spirit, and checkes of our owne consciences, accusing vs for the least thing that wee haue at any time done amisse, or haue daily from the beginning of our manhood, vnto this present done against thee, euen thisweeke, this last day, this night, and this morning since wee arose; yea, euen now in this instant, while we are speaking vnto thee.
            O Lord, for Christ his sake, pardon all our offences of dishonesty against our neighbours with whom wee liue, and conuerse in this life. O keepe vs this day most sweete Sauiour, from that odious and common sinne of lying, directly, or indirectly, from swearing, &amp; chasing rashly, vainely or irreuerently, in, or against thy most holy name. And keepe vs from all manner of dishonesty, with our bodies, with our tongues, with our eyes, with our

hands, and with our feete, vnto which wee are so exceeding prone. And that because we are thy temples, and members one of another, and of thy Sonne Christ especially.
            And for our helpe herein, giue vs grace, that we may euery one, seriously apply, and diligently minde the things thou hast this day appointed vs to doe in our seuerall rankes and callings: as we are either fathers, masters, children or seruants, that we may both gouerne and obey, as becommeth thy children and seruants, which feare thy holy name; and giue vs grace that wee may this day, and all the dayes of our life, perseuere in the faith, and feare of thee, and of thy Sonne Iesus, our most louing and blessed Sauiour.
            And grant most louing Father, that as we haue begunne in him; so wheresoeuer we are, at the last we may finish our mortall race in

him, and change this life vnto his glory and our owne eternall comforts.
            Now hauing continued our accustomed suites for spirituall blessings and graces, we returne vnto thee most humble and hearty thankes for all those fauours, which as assurances of all thy loue, thou hast giuen euery one of vs here present: as in our births into this present world, thou didst safely bring vs, through the straight gates of nature (which

               And breake thy lawes with all despight,
               when thou hadst made him pure and holy;
               Plac'd him in garden of delight,
               so great and wicked was his folly.
            
            
               That hauing leaue to take or leaue,
               to chuse, refuse, or vse at pleasure;
               He did himselfe by sinne deceiue,
               of that diuine surpassing treasure:
               And by his mutabilitie,
               (regardlesse of thy sacred lawes;)
               He brought in instabilitie,
               lost his free-will by breach of lawes.
            
            
               Thou God of Iusti

               By grace substraction didst requite,
               and banish him that blessed place:
               By meanes of which we are inclin'd,
               from thy behestes to run astray;
               
                  
Our tongue, our heart, our soule, our mind,
               by sinne is carried cleane away.
            
            
               Thou hast vs Lord by grace elected,
               and thy free mercy) to inherit
               Thy blisse, (if thy blisse be respected)
               and seal'd vs with thy holy spirit:

               In soules and bodies for our good,

               serue thee in holy righteousnes;
               Thou gauest thy Sonne, and he vs bought,
               from thraldome of our sinfulnes:
               Thou would'st he should for all men die,
               to make him liue in thine elect;
               And they in him to

               By grace, and holy inspiration,
               rebellious nature seek'st to tame;
               With precepts for instruction,
               and leau'st vs lawes in thine owne name;
               The ready way of seruing thee,
               and profit to our neighbours bring;
               
                  
And louing thee most zealously,
               who art our Father, Lord and King.
            
            
               Though by thy Gospell we be free,
               from lawes their sting and punishment;
               Yet rules of life and pietie,
               thou hast precrib'd and to vs lent:
               Thereby to manage all our deeds,
               and guide vs lest we step awrie;
               Obseruing carefull as we needs,
               how well to liue, and well to die.
            
            
               These lawes thou writ'st in Table two,
               with the pure finger of thine hand;
               Deliuering them Moses vnto,
               that we thy will might vnderstand:
               The first containeth precepts foure,
               Of precepts due vnto thy feare;
               The second sixe Commanrements more,
               of loue we should to neighbours beare.
            
            
               The summe and substance of them all,
               and that fulfilleth euery part,
               Is thee to loue, on thee to call,
               with all our soule, might, mind, and heart:
               To other men (especially,)
               thine houshold that are firme in faith;
               
                  
As to our selues to giue supply;
               with all our helpe as Scripture saith.
            
            
               But we are weake, the case thus stands,

               No man can keepe these thy commands,
               but breakes them at all times and houres:
               Yet thou thy children oft doest will,
               themstlues to comfort hopefully;
               There is left for them some measure still,
               to come to thee regardfully.
            
            
               Namely when they doe bend their strength,
               (daily preuented by thy Spirit)

            An Euening Meditation.
            
               I Lay me downe to sleepe in peace,
               for thou Lord onely makest me dwell
               In safety with great quietnes,
               and doest ill dreames from me expell:
               My body to enormities.
               is subiect without rest and sleepe;
               Because of mine infirmities,
               my life and health it cannot keepe.
            
            
               Good Father all sufficient,
               my louing God I yeeld thee praise;
               For this dayes blessings to me sent,
               and guiding me in all my wayes:
               In that thou hast this day now past,
               me strongly guarded with thy hands;
               
                  
With loue refresht me, first and last,
               with mercies more then sea-shore sands.
            
            
               That hast me brought to this dayes end,
               blacke night and darkenes drawing neare,
               Wherein all creatures rest attend,
               and lay them downe till day appeare:
               I finding my debility,
               poore creature, run to the diuine;
               O strength mine imbecility,
               and aide this soule and body mine.
            
            
               Thou hast me made of matter grosse,
               and brittle substance out of clay;
               Which still is subiect to the crosse,
               a tennis ball for worldlings play:
               He wanting comfort cannot liue,
               after much sorrow and great griefe;
               Therefore I doe my body giue,
               and soule to thee, Lord grant reliefe.
            
            
               O Lord I doe thee humbly pray,
               as thou art fountaine of all rest;
               Bee thou my succour, helpe and stay,
               let me by thee this night be blest:
               Consider me in my weakenesse,
               and let my carefull eyes behold;
               
                  
My miseries and my distresse,
               to cry for mercy make me bold.
            
            
               And since 'tis time that night now brings,
               the bodies rest and quiet sleepe;
               O shadow me vnder thy wings,
               let thy protection safe me keepe:
               Looke ouer me with watchfull eyes,
               when this corrupted flesh of mine;
               In slumbring sleepe and dulnesse lyes,
               depriu'd of sense with closed eyne.
            
            
               Vnable my poore selfe to saue,
               from dangers of the darkesome night;
               Keepe me, my bed else is my graue,
               and I shall neuer see the light:
               Lord thou that onely mak'st me dwell,
               and in sure safety to abide;
               (Thou watchest ouer Israel)
               watch ouer me, be by my side.
            
            
               Thou art my Castle and my Fort,
               my sword, my buckler and defence;
               My rocke, my refuge and comfort,
               saue me from force and violence:
               Alas without thee what am I?
               a beast that rightly nothing knowes;
               
                  
A senseles blocke, sillie flie,
               that no good doe, nor no good showes.
            
            
               Thy louing fauour Lord extend,
               ouer the house wherein I rest;
               My bed with Angels Lord defend,
               and soule and body by thee be blest:
               Oh, lay me downe in rest and peace,
               in rest and peace ô let me rise;
               In rest and peace, ô giue some ease,
               from torments, troubles, teares und cries.
            
            
               Let not the sleights of sinne deceiue,
               nor wicked practise ouertake me;
               Let nothing me of hope bereaue,
               oh doe not thou (though all) forsake me:
               Lord I am poore, oh make me rich,
               with those great riches of thy blessing;
               My soule, my soule is blacke as pitch,
               let pardon follow my confessing.
            
            
               In hope of this I lay me downe,
               depending on thy prouidence;
               I care not if the world doe frowne,
               for I am safe by thy defence:
               Lord let it be, for I am thine,
               my rest make sweete and comfortable;
               
                  
To thee I doe my selfe resigne,
               Lord grant all this, for thou art able.
            
         
         
            An Euening Prayer, for a priuate person.
            O Most holy Father, and my most gracious God which giuest vnto all men, the cheerefull light of the day, that in thine assistance they may follow their honest vocations; and likewise sendest the silent nights, that then they my rest their wearied limbs, and busied mindes, and so returne their due thankes for thy goodnesse: I sinfull creature adore and praise thee for the totall summe of all thy mercies, whereof I haue beene this day partaker.
            O Lord I am vile, looke not vpon mine vnworthinesse, folly, and wickednesse: but appease thy anger iustly conceiued against me, and forgiue what hath beene amisse in me this day, or at any other

time, euen for his sake who is thy well beloued Sonne, and my deare Aduocate.
            Roote vp ô Lord, the thornes of mine euill inclination, and affections, and in their places make the fruits of vertue to spring: inflame my heart with the desire of heauenly loue, that I may loue obedience to thy Gommandements with zeale as hot as fire, louing thee aboue all things, and my neighbour as my selfe.
            Giue me grace ô Lord, to serue thee in true faith, feare, and holinesse, all the dayes of my life, and to ouercome my mortall enemies, the desires of the world, the pleasures of the flesh, and the suggestious of the wicked Spirit, remembring my promise made to thee in Baptisme, for the performance whereof I depend onely vpon thy holy Spirit.
            O God of glorious light, let thine Angels pitch their tents round about this house, for our

defence now in the time of this darkenesse, and grant that this nights sleepe may bee quiet vnto mee without griefe or trouble, preserue me and mine both in body and soule from all dangers, and offences, which may come either by foolish dreames, noysome spirits, or vncleannesse of corrupt nature; waken me againe, ô Lord, in due time, and let me behold the light of the next day to my comfort, prepare my heart and minde to thy seruice euery day in all trueth and sinceritie, that when I haue runne the race of this life, thou mayest please to call mee to be partaker of a better. Comfort mee, ô Lord, in all those things wherein I haue beene any wayes dismayed this day: take not thy holy spirit from me, but continue the motions thereof in my heart, that when as the tempter shal
                  •
                come with his assaults, I may bee furnished with the shield o
                  •
                faith to quench his fiery darts.
            
               
Confirme my weakenesse, and grant that this nights sleepe may be sweet and healthfull for my body, and a profitable memoriall of that sleepe which at my last end, in that great night, shall make a separation betweene my body and soule.
            Let alwayes thine vnspeakeable mercies preserue mee, thy endlesse sweetnesse reioyce mee, thy heauenly trueth strengthen mee, thy knowledge embolden mee, and thy goodnesse keepe me now and for euermore from mine enemies visible and inuisible, that I may awake in the morning in perfect sense and good health, and for the same bee thankefull vnto thee, and carefully betake mee to my vocation and calling for Iesus Christs sake, my onely Sauiour.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            
            Another for the Euening.
            MOst glorious and sacred Trinitie, the most mighty God, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Spirit, which art the authour and originall of all things, both in heauen and in earth, and that hast appointed vnto euery thing his end and way in this life. The eyes of all things are towards thee to finish in their courses that obedience they owe vnto thee. The Sunne, the Moone, the Starres in most constant order extend their light &amp; heate to the comforting, not onely of fowles and beasts, but specially to the direction of man, how to know thee and walke in thy wayes, as being the bookes and characters wherein wee may reade thy power, wisedome, and incomprehensible glory, for their sound and language (as a Harold) is gone foorth to proclaime vnto the Nations, both Pagan &amp; Christian,

that thou art the Lord God Almighty, and most worthy to be praised, as in the Morning, so in the Euening also.
            Therefore knowing the great dependancy, that all things caelestiall and terrestriall haue on thee, I doe humbly intreate thee to take mee into thy custody this night: knowing that if a Sparrow cannot with safetie fall to the ground but by thee, that without thee so great refreshing of sleepe cannot be attained vnlesse I begge it of thee, many are the visions of the night, as idle dreames and fancies, that would interrupt my sleepe, if thou Lord by thy gracious power and presence of thy good Spirit driue them not away. And Sathan would (like Abi

                body.
            Therefore vnto thee the keeper

of Israel, that neither slumberest nor sleepest, by night, nor by day, doe I come beseeching thee, that laying my selfe to rest in thee, I may in the acustomed time which thou hast appointed, wake again: but if thou pleasest that this night shall bee my last, and that this mortall, shall bee swallowed vppe in immortallity. O Lord grant though I die in body, yet I may awake in soule, and liue with thee for euermore; and that my body so sleeping, yet againe may awake at the resurrection of the iust, and with those that shall not sleepe, bee caught vp, with soule vnited by the same power, by which thou (ô Sauiour) didst at once rise from death to life, euen as that life which thou hadst with the father, before the world was. And as thou art one with him, so grant that after my last sleepe, I may be one with thee in the presence of the Father, and the holy Ghost for euermore.
            
               
But (ô Lord) if thou please to raise me vp againe, to spend more dayes in this vale of teares, grant that I may liue honestly in the workes of my vocation, which thou hast ordained me to liue in, or liue by. Grant that I may set thee before mine eyes, day and night, and behold thee alwayes in my presence; that when I am tempted to any eueill, in the work of my calling, or any other wayes: I may not bee tickled with the profit or pleasures therein obiected, and so prouoked to sinne against thee. Keepe my tongue from lying, lest thereby I become the child of Sathan, for hee is a lyer, and the Father of lyes from the beginning; keepe my tongue from swearing, and that I may not take thy name in vaine: empty my heart of couetousnesse, of pride, of vaine-glory, and let mee not respect worldly vanitie, let me not be selfe-conceited: but, ô Lord, giue mee to bee of humble,

gentle, harmelesse and courteous disposition and behauiour, both in my words and deeds, to my superiours and inferiours.
            O Lord giue me to be of a charitable nature, and of a pittifull affection, toward all men in generall, but especially towards all those that are (of the houshold of Faith, of broken and contrite hearts, which thou Lord hast promised, that thou wilt not despise. Grant ô heauenly Father, that Christ both sleeping and waking, in this life, and after this life may be to me aduantage. O let me not fall into a custome or habite of sinning, lest therewith my heart become hardened, that I cannot repent, but giue mee such a conscience of sinne, that I may neuer commit sin either great or small, but my heart may affright, terrific, and amaze m

            And when I haue sinned, let thy

louing countenance shine vpon me, (as it did vpon Peter, when hee had denied thee) that I may poure forth a fountaine of teares.
            And in bed if I happen to awake at midnight, giue mee thy holy Spirit, that with sobs, sighes, and groanes, in the secret closet of my heart, I may cast vp loude cryes vnto thee, not onely for my sinnes past, in the darke night of my childhood and youth, while I knew not thee, but euen now, since I came to some groath and manhood in Christ, I haue broken all thy Commandements, thy Lawes, thy Statutes, thine Ordinances; not in ignorance, but in knowledge: for which I haue neede againe to pray vnto thee. Wherefore Lord forgiue mee, forgiue mee for thy Christ his sake.
            O my Loue, my Doue (the blessed and powerfull Sauiour of my soule) thou knowest that I haue sought after thee, euer since I

knew thee, by night in my bedde haue I sought thee whom my soule loueth. O my Sauiour, since thou hast first drawne mee with the cordes of thy loue, let the strength thereof hold mee so fast, that I may for euer abide constant, in the like loue to thee againe; Thou hast promised, that him thou once louedst, that thou wilt loue him vnto the end. Good God in thy loue keepe mee this night in soule and body: and not onely mee in mine owne person, but all that belong vnto mee, for the loue of thy onely Sonne Iesus, to whom with the Father, and the holy Ghost, be all honour and glory by mee and all thine, this night &amp; for euermore, world without end.

            An Inuocation to God, humbly praying for remission of sinnes.
            
               VVEll-spring of bounty, God of feare,
               beginning that mak'st all begin;
               With what oblation to appeare,
               t'appease thy wrath that's due for sin:
               I know the blood of bulls and beast,
               or sweetest Incense that doth rise;
               From earth of old they were the least,
               and are not now of any prise.
            
            
               O how should I be reconcil'd,
               againe vnto thy louing fauour;
               How long Lord, shall I be exil'd,
               from my sweete Lord, and onely Sauiour:
               How long, oh! haue I call'd to thee,

before thy seate of clement grace;
               But may not peepe within thy portall,
               nor see thy glorious beauteous face.
            
            
               I sighe, I mourne, my teares are seas,
               I sinke vnder the burdenous load;

               My selfe chastising I desire,
               to quench thy wrath with floods of teares;
               Yet still encrease thy fearefull fire,
               and so eucrease my daily feares.
            
            
               By prayers thee to presse who dares,
               except by thy Sonnes mediation;
               To seeke thy glory's all our cares,
               and the end of earthly mens creation:
               What course should I then poore wretch take,
               to doe, or aske that's good and iust;
               But vnto thee my prayers make,
               and onely in thy Sonne put trust.
            
            
               If that my sinnes shall thee offend,
               then all thy creatures rage and storme;

from sight of thine all-seeing eyne;
               As Noahs Doue, on earth am I,
               and cannot looke against thy shine.
            
            
               But if thou show thy louing face,
               all creatures on my seruice tend;
               Men, beasts, and Angels, doe me grace,
               to helpe me all their powers doe bend:
               What should I then, say, giue or doe?
               what paine can gaine thy fauour lost;
               Riuers of oyle, or ought thereto,
               they are thine owne, and of thy cost.

               of heart, and calues of lippes vnfain'd:

               They to thy mercies seate appeale,
               and would make peace for mine offending.

for without him no helpe can bee;

               Till I know that thy wrath's appeas'd,
               and haue thy Charter for my pardon;
               Then shall I finde my heart so eas'd,
               that I desire no further guērdon:

And though our sinnes, in which wee so much abound, haue deserued that thou shouldest send those ministring Spirits, as on Egypts first borne in the night, to take away this our dying life, or life full of

death: yet for thy mercies sake let them be our gardians, not ouely this night, but all the dayes and nights of this life, for euer to further our soules and bodies, in thy obedience; and in, and after death to conduct them to Abrahams bosome, to rest in ioy and blisse with thee for euermore; yea let thine Angels of light, that continually behold thy face in heauen, bee about our bodies night and day, and with louing and kind assistance, keeping euill from vs, and vs from euill: not onely of sinne, but of temptation, with which that worldly Gouernour, and Prince of the Ayre neuer cea

O Lord, if by thy holy Spirit, we happen to be so strong as by none of these baites to bee caught, then hee laboureth by temporall crosses, and afflictions of body and minde, (as on Iob) to draw vs to distrust and dispaire in thy mercie and loue, in all which assaults let thy grace, and our faith keepe vs, that we may not bee ouercome, but as valiant souldiers in Christ, and through the Armory of God, in which by our holy calling we are girt, we may leade captiuitie captiue, and bee more then Conquerours through him that loueth vs. So that neither the feares of the day, nor the terrours of the night, of death, and hell, should separate vs from the assured guard of thee, and thy Angels, the conductors and furtherers of our saluation. This thy great helpe, and especiall assistance, wee are continually enforced to craue, not for our owne sakes: but for thy Sonne his sake,

            To the Lord of Hoastes and God of glory, our Creatour: to thee ô Christ Iesus our Mediator, thee most holy Spirit proceeding from the Father, and the Sonne, bee ascribed all praise and glory this night and for euermore.
            Amen, Amen.
         
         
            Another for the Euening.
            O Eternall God, and most mercifull Father, wee acknowledge and confesse against our selues, that our hearts and hands are full of all filthinesse and sinnes whatsoeuer, and we are altogether vnworthy to speake vnto thee, or to come neere thy presence: Neuertheles being so much boūd vnto thee, as this day past and all other times of our liues doe witnesse:

we most humbly offer vnto thy holinesse (by the hands of Iesus Christ our Mediatour) our humble duties of praise &amp; thanksgiuing for our Creation, Election, Redemption, Vocation, and Sanctification, with all other good graces appertaining to this life, or that which is to come.
            And namely, ô Lord, our tongues, and lippes shall glorifie thee, sitting aboue the Cherubims, for preseruing vs this day past, from so many miseries, and casualties whereunto wee might iustly haue fallen, if thou wouldest haue entered into iudgement with vs: but Lord, thou art mercifull, and passest by our manifold offences, to winne vs by thy long sufferance: we beseech thee make vs thankefull for thy mercies and carefull to doethy will.
            O Lord, pardon and forgiue v

                all our sinnes, and grant vs euery day more and more the sight o

                  •
               
               
repentance for the same. Giue vs faith and grace to beleeue all the sweete promises that thou hast made to vs in Christ Iesus, both for the remission of our sins, and the hope of a better life, strengthē vs from aboue with thy mighty hand to walke in euery good way; and to bring forth the fruits of a true &amp; liuely faith in our liues and conuersation all the daies of our pilgrimage here. Arme vs, ô Lord, with thy grace and holy Spirit against all the corruptions of the world, the temptations of the deuill, &amp; the allurements of the flesh, and settle our mindes to the continuall exercise of deuout prayer, with the hearing of thy sacred word, watching for thy comming both publicke and priuate.
            Continue thy goodnes towards vs in prouiding for vs such things as are necessary for the maintenance of this present life, &amp; blesse the same vnder our hands, that the little which wee haue by thy

goodnesse may be encreased, and the encrease may serue as well to furnish our necessary vses, as to minister vnto the necessitie of others, according to our abilities. Keepe vs Lord this night from all euils, which may happen either to our bodies or soules: Extend thy goodnesse towards all those that depend vpon vs, or wee on them. Giue vs quiet sleepe and rest, and when we shall awake, let all our thoughts and cogitations be holy meditations on thee and thy law. Blesse vs, ô Lord, all the nights and dayes of our liues, and at the end thereof, send vs a blessed departure, and afterward a ioyfull resurrection vnto life eternall, grant vs these good things most mercifull Father, and all other needefull graces for Iesus Christ his sake, in whose name wee further call vpon thee as our Lord and Sauiour hath taught vs in his Gospell, saying. Our Father which are in heauen, &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            A godly Meditation, wherein the distressed sheweth his vnfained griefe and sorrow, for hauing offended so powerfull a God, and so-mercifull and gracious a Father
            
               ALas that I offended euer,
               this God of gods, this Lord of powers;
               That can in peeces all men shiuer,
               and ouerturne the stateliest towers:
               Ah, woe is me that I offended,
               and iustly God stirr'd vp to ire;
               Who by his Law hath sinne condemned.
               vnto the pit of endlesse fire.
            
            
               I daily see Gods creatures all,
               iustly for sinne displeas'd with me;
               Mens hearts are hardned and with gall,
               feede me that haue offended thee:
               My God thy blessings all on earth,
               tho duoest with-hold and from me keepe,
               Alas my soule sustaines a dearth
               of grace, vnto thy grace I creepe.
            
            
               But what to doe, or what to say,
               I know not Lord, but I know this;
               
                  
My griefes encrease more day by day,
               my mirth is moane, bane is my blisse.
            
            
               One euill doth another call,
               like waues on waues in raging seas;
               My weary burthen makes me fall,
               I finde no comfort, helpe, nor ease,
               I hope of helpe, but that hope quailes,
               in crosses are my comforts ended;
               I flie to Faith, but then Faith failes,
               when I neede most to be defended,
            
            
               As if I were the onely man,
               prepos'd by thine intendement;
               Whom heauen ond earth must curse and ban,
               as subiect of all punishment:
               Thy iustice damnes me, I appeale
               to mercy, then appeal'd I feare
               To be reiected, thus cold zeale,
               and secret sinnes with griefe I beare.
            
            
               Shall I thinke it a fruitlesse taske,
               vnto my God for to repaire;
               That sinners cals and bids them aske,
               and they shall haue all things by prayer:
               Can it be bootelesse downe to fall,
               before his throne of Maiestie;
               
                  
And with repentant tongue to call,
               for pardon for mine iniquitie.
            
            
               May not vnfaigned cries, at last
               preuaile with him thats pittifull,
               To pardon mine offences past,
               reuiue my soule which now is dull:
               Ile frame my heart to meditate,
               my tongue to vtter what may please
               Him, whom best knoweth my estate,
               and seeke his wrath for to appease.
            
            
               To him ile goe in Christ his name,
               in whom I know he is well pleas'd;
               And will confesse my sinne with shame,
               and so mine heart shall sure be eas'd:
               For Christs sake looke on me againe,
               he is God all-sufficient;
               He doth behold and see my paine,
               my inward faithfull hearts intent.
            
            
               He knoweth what I goe about,
               all I thinke, speake, or doe amisse
               He writes or notes without all doubt,
               in his remembrance booke it is:
               I know he will in worth accept,
               what iustly I intend to be;
               
                  
And cannot it performe, except
               he put his helping hand thereto;
            
            
               He knoweth that I am but flesh,
               and what is flesh but fraile and ill:
               And what is man, a lumpe of trash,
               whom vaine desires doe fully fill:
               And will this God Iehouah high,
               so strong and powerfull set his might;
               Against a worme so weake as I,
               a silly man, a shade of night.
            
            
               What conquest can there be in God,
               to worke reuenge on me poore soule;
               Who still corrects me with his rod,
               whose Iustice doth my sinnes controle:
               Shall I dispute with thee, nay rather,
               poore wretch I should fall prostrate downe,
               And humbly kneele vnto my Father,
               and pray with teares when he doth frowne.
            
            
               If he afflict more, be it so,
               if further plague me, le't be so,
               If he will kill with paines and woe,
               doe what he will, let it be so:
               For I am his, doe what he will,
               with me and all that mine can bee;
               
                  
It is his owne, and must be still,
               there's no disputing (Lord) with thee.
            
            
               There is no Art, or Eloquence,
               can quench thy coales of burning ire;
               It is not words can make defence,
               nor friends can saue me from the fire:
               Nor take me from thy powerfull hands,
               so full of might, force, strength and power;
               Or breake in sunder, thy strong bands,
               nor ease one minute of an houre.
            
            
               Ile yeeld me therefore to his will,
               Lord doe what thy good pleasure is;
               Turne me as may, thy minde fulfill,
               ile waite the time of happy blisse:
               Ile waite thy pleasure, time will come,
               wherein I may the issue see
               Of my afflictions all and some,
               and what thy purpose is with me.
            
            
               The meane time I will with thy word,
               consult and vse my exercise;
               And comfort take through hope ô Lord,
               refresh dull spirits, and cleare dimme eyes:
               With dewe of thy sweete promises,
               laying aside all fleshly aide;
               
                  
I onely rest on thy mercies,
               in holy word as thou hast saide.
            
            
               And in true faith will I remaine,
               and seeke thee (being the true way)
               Wherein who walkes, at length shall gaine,
               true blisse and happinesse for aye:
               Who this embraceth shall not erre,
               wherein who liues, shall neuer dye;
               But weare a crowne past reason farre,
               and liue with God eternally.

to support me, I may beleeue in thee; and though with the eyes of my flesh, I see no hope, but that my faith may frustrate mee; yet like Peter I may not sinke, but seeke for further helpe from thee: and being assured that euery word of promise is most certaine, let me still, aboue hope, and beyond hope, beleeue in thee: yea, and though with holy Iob thou kill my body, yet will I trust in thee, for I know thou wilt saue my spirit and vnite them againe, in the day of the Lord.

O Lord, though the stipend of my sinne be death, and the merit of my transgression, eternal

Lord, I thanke thee

negligences and ignorances, thoughts, words, and deedes, and keepe mee from presumptuous sinnes.
            O Lord, looke not vpon the Pharisie, for he dissembleth, nor vpon the Publican first, for hee sayeth little for himselfe in outward shew, nor vpon Mary Magdalen onely, for she had but seuen deuills; but looke vpon me, that of sinners am chiefe, worse then either Pharisie, Publicane, or Marie, who haue as many sinnes as haires vpon my head, and a greater clogge vpon my Conscience, then any burthen that man hath to beare, and doe therefore openly, earnestly, vnfainedly and continually call vpon thee. O Lord keepe vnder Satan that hee compell not my conscience to dispaire, quench all the euill motions of my minde, striuing against thy diuine pleasure, and restore in me the Image of thy Sonne, that I may liue in thy feare, dye

in thy fauour, rest in thy peace, rise in thy power, and remaine in thy glory, for Iesus Christ his sake, our onely Lord and Sauiour.
            Amen.
         
         
            In this Meditation, the distressed humbly confesseth his sinnes, and the vanities of his former times, lewdly mispent; and resolueth (and exhorteth all others) to returne vnto God with speedy, true and vnfained repentance.
            
               AN heart thats broken and contrite,
               to God is a sweet sacrifice,
               Repentant sinners him delight,
               farre more then iust men in their eyes:
               What I haue bene, my God hath knowne,
               What I now am, the Lord doth see;
               What I shall bee to him is showne,
               from him no secret kept can be.
            
            
               How I consum'd so many yeares,
               mispent so many months and dayes.
               Both houres and minutes all appeares,
               to God who markes my life and wayes:
               
                  
Time is the meane that all things tries,
               Time worketh what mens wits deuise.
               Time with his swiftnesse euer flyes,
               And Time in time will make men wise.
            
            
               Fly from me follies of my youth,
               packe hence my sinnes that burd'ned me,
               Welcome to me is Age and Truth,
               now I by faith in Christ will be:
               Whose sinnes doe make my heart to bleed,
               let them examples take by me
               Whose wickednesse all mens exceeds,
               come Lord in mercy: pardon me.
            
            
               Lord now let me depart in peace,
               I 
                     ••
                  ele thy rod, I finde thy loue:
               My paines doe grow, my ioyes encrease,
               this mercie comes from thee aboue:
               My sicknesse is a present meane,
               to heale and cure my wounds of sinne:
               Lord purge all my corruptions cleane,
               and let my death my life beginne.
            
         
         
            
            A Prayer for the forgiuenesse of Sinnes.
            ETernall God and louing Sauiour, before thy Baptisme, thou didst send Iohn the Baptist to preach remission of sins, through repentance and faith in thy name: And after thou wert Baptized, and entered into thy Ministrie, thou that didst exhort all that were weary, and laden with their sinnes, to come vnto thee, saying, that thou cammest to call sinners to repentance, and that the whole had no need of the Phisitian, but the sicke. Wherefore, o Lord, being deadly sicke, with the sence of my sinnes, and with the Samaritane wounded vnto death: I entreate thee in the teares of a sorrowfull heart, to wash me, not onely my hands, feete, and head, but also my heart from sinne. O Lord powre into my wounds the oyle of mercy, that it may pacifie

and quiet my minde in thee. O Lord wash me with the bloud of thy Sonne, as with Hysop, for I haue with the Prodigall sonne, and Lost sheepe erred in the vanitie of my minde. But, ô Lord, as Philip found Nathaniel, when hee looked not for him; So by true repentance, and hearty confession, let me be found of thee, and in thee, now seeking after thee. O Lord I thirst after thee, and for thee, wherefore send thy holy Spirit into mee, to mollifie and comfort my hard and vnrepentant heart.
            O Lord, it cannot by nature, enter into my minde, that I am so wretched a sinner, but by thy word as vnto Nichodemus, thou hast made me to see, that except by true repentance I be regenerat, and so, as it were, borne againe, I cannot enter into the Kingdome of heauen; that is, possibly be saued. But, ô Lord, thou hast made me to know sinne, and how sinne

became sinne, by the reuerent vse of thy word, for though there be sinne in vs, before the knowledge of thy Law, yet sinne without thy Law was not imputed: but thou hast giuen vs Christians, this thy law as a touchstone, to know sin, and that sinne is the transgression of the Law, for if there were no Law, there would be no transgression, wherefore thy Law which was ordained vnto me vnto life, by the search thereof, hath slaine mee vnto death, and made me immeasurably sinfull, for by the Law, thou hast made mee to know sinne, which by no other meanes I could know, or should euer haue found out, for how should I haue knowne lust to be sinne, if thou hadst not said I should not lust. Wherefore, O Lord, seeing it is so with me, that I doe the euill which I would not, and leaue vndone the good that I would, binde this strong man in mee, that though Sinne

dwell in mee, yet hee may not raigne ouer or rule in mee, yea mortifie the wicked deeds of my flesh, by thy holy word, and mighty operation of thy spirit. O grant that by the dying of the Lord Iesus, sinne in all his kindes and force, may be subdued, and dye in me: lest that thereby I be made to come short of thy glory, which thou hast promised to all repentant sinners.
            Good God grant, that I may not yeeld my members, seruants vnto sinnes, but reserue them seruants vnto thee, in true righteousnesse and holinesse, all the dayes I haue to liue in this life. O Lord, as Ammon hated his sister Tamar, after hee had abused her with himselfe, and himselfe with her, so that hee could not abide 
                  •
               ere, (nor (well might) himselfe) by reason of himselfe: giue mee grace, I may hate sinne, not onely after, but before it is committed with no lesse indignation then

they did each other, and thou them both. O Lord let the old man that is in me, be so crucified with Christ in the power of his death, that I may henceforth be no more seruant vnto sinne, for that thou hast said, that a carnall man liuing in sinne, cannot please thee. O Lord giue me thy spirit that I may hate the things of the flesh, which are nothing but san against thee, and loue the things of thy spirit, as ioy in the holy Ghost, peace of conscience, longsuffering, patience in bearing, and forbearing wrongs, with faith and the like graces and fruits of thy most holy spirit. O Lord, seeing I haue, to the subduing of sin, desired the gift of thy holy spirit, let mee be carefull, by the vse of all holy meanes, to walke in the spirit. And seeing thou hast condemned sinne, in him that knew no sinne, for my sake, O Lord condemne it not in me againe; and as the first birth is nothing but

sinfull Adam, Lord graunt that by this my second birth, I may be a continuall liuing spirituall man in Christ: thus hauing confessed my sinnes with hearty sorrow, I beseech thee, for my Sauiour his sake, to forgiue me my sinne, and to strengthen mee all the dayes of my life to come, that with the man in the Gospell I may follow thy heauenly counsell and sinne no more, neither in action, affection, nor intention, lest this my confession and contrition should be in vaine, which, O Lord forbid, for thy Christ his sake.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            The Repentant complaineth of the grieuousnesse of his sinnes, and desireth mercie and pardon, and to be deliuered from Sinne, and the guilt and punishment thereof.
            
               HIdden, O Lord, are my most horrid sinnes,
               vnto the world, though open plain to thee,
               
                  
He neuer betters, that no time begins,
               corruption killeth all good thoughts in me.
               What sinne doth dwell in this vild flesh of ours,
               but doeth encrease like monsters huge in me,
               Committing them, both minuts, dayes &amp; houres
               as swift as time, so fast grow they in me.
            
            
               Rent thine own flesh, &amp; teare thy wretched haire,
               scrape clean corruptions marrow frō thy bones:
               Put out thine eyes, cut off thy tongue stop eares;
               lame all thy senses, to kill sinne at once.
               I faine would walk, that know not how to creepe,
               I am opprest with such most hainous crimes:
               When I should walk, sin drowneth me with sleepe,
               for one good thought I sinne a thousand times.
            
            
               Sigh, O my soule, weepe, sorrow, and lament,
               and seeke for helpe, if any hope be left,
               Pray vnto Christ for grace thou mayst repent,
               before his merits from thee be bereft.
               Though by his rod, afflictions humble thee,
               and for thy sinnes thou suffer grieuous paine,
               Yet with his flesh he still vpholdeth thee,
               frō deepe despaire, in bliss with him to raigne.
            
            
               All glory be to God on high,
               and to his Son, our Sauiour wise and iust:
               
                  
To whom with ioy, still pray and sing will I,
               and to my Comforter the holy Ghost,
               Whose being was from all eternity,
               one Deitie distinct in persons three,
               According to the blessed Trinity,
               distinguisht to three, yet one in vnitie.
            
            
               
                  Abba, ben, Ruach, sacred trinitie,
               one drop of Nectar Lord on me bestow,
               That glorious blood to cure sinnes miserie,
               that all mankinde thy loue to me may know.
               Let not sinnes hire, nor grieuous punishment
               be condemnation to my stained soule,
               Be pleased with Christ his all-sufficient payment,
               who ransom'd vs from sinnes eternall thralls.
            
         
         
            A prayer to be said on a Sunday morning, for the right sanctifying of the Sabbath.
            O Lord of Sabbath, that in the beginning after the finishing of the sixe dayes workes, in which by thy most mightie word, thou didst create the heauen and the earth, and produce all

this wonderfull variety of things which wee perceiue euery day most admirably to be made, not onely in the sensible, but also in all insensible liuing things: of all which workes, thou hast caused man, chiefely to excell, hauing in him most curiously epitomised all the glory of this earthly fabrick, and for all this thy great goodnesse, thou hast done vnto him, hast onely required of him, that he in the contemplation of these created things, not only without, but within himselfe, might finde out thee, a louing Father and Creatour; and doe vnto thee that high homage, that thou hast commanded on this day, not as slaues, and seruants, but as sonnes filled with all duty &amp; obedience, which that wee might doe, thou hast charged vs, on the seuenth day to remember our Creatour, not onely by refraining our seruile labour, which in the sixe dayes thou hast appointed vs, but by

leauing the wicked workes of darknesse, vnto which we are by nature, and wicked desires, so much addicted. O Lord graunt that I may sequester my selfe, this day vnto thy praise, not onely in thy holy Congregation, but in the secret cogitations of my heart. And graunt that euery word, or thing that I shall this day, heare with my eares, or see with my eyes, may be so digested in my soule, as fit subiects, out of which I may bee occasioned to magnifie thy praise and glory.
            O heauenly Father, graunt that all those Sabbath dayes which haue passed in my youth and manhood, while I knew thee not, may be now recalled, by double diligence, in the deuout hearing of thy Word, receiuing of the Sacraments, and calling vpon thy name, which on this day thou hast for euer commanded to bee done vnto thee in thy Church and holy Congregation.
            
               
And, O Lord, let my heart depart, edified in thy most holy feare, not for the present while I am hearing, but for euer while I shall liue, and let some part of thy holy Word, which I shall heare expounded this day, abide in me, that at all times, when I shall haue occasion, or be called thereunto, I may bee fitted and furnished, to giue a full account, and reason, of the hope I haue in thee. O Lord, thy Apostles haue called this day, not now the seuenth day from the Creation, but the first day, and the Lords day, putting vs in mind of that high and admirable benefit of our Redemption, as on this day accomplished by his glorious resurrection, for the which wee can neuer rēder too much thanks, neither publick nor priuate.
            O Lord, make my heart like the good ground, mentioned in the Parable, that when it had receiued good seede, it brought forth, thirty, sixty, and an hundreth

fold: so most sweet Sauiour graunt, that I may haue thy Word so deepely rooted, by the power of thy holy spirit, this day sent downe into my heart, that I may bring it forth in an hundreth fold, thy power in my saluation. And let it abide this day and euer in my soule, the most sweet sauour of life vnto life: O Lord driue from mee all impediments, arising from the thoughts of the world, the flesh and the deuill, by which Sathan laboureth, to frustrate in me, the sauing hearing of thy Word: and make me to heare thy precious Word with all reuerence and humility, not as the word of man, but as it is indeede the word of God.
            And seeing thou hast said, not the hearers of the law, but the doers of the law are iustified: O Lord make me a doer of the law. And as thou hast againe said, Blessed are yee, if ye doe these things. Wherefore Lord that I may bee

capable of thy blessing, graunt that this day, when I haue heard, I may doe the things, and (as thy blessed Mother) pondered all thy sayings, and layd them vp in her heart, to remember them. O sweet Sauiour, helpe me this day and other dayes and times, so often as I shall heare thy word, or reade the same, that my memory may be so quicke and fresh, that I may retaine and remember all, that shal most especially concerne me: and not to be filled with idle knowledge, but with constant doing, that I may be accepted among those builders, that set their house vpon the rocke, most blessed Lord let me not be so simple, as to thinke my selfe blessed, by bare looking into thy law, by an outward conformity, in comming to thy Church to heare, lest in so doing, I become as a forgetfull hearer, that offers to thee a sacrifice of fooles, and so in sanctifying this thy Sabaoth so idely,

thou cast mee out among the hypocrites, the chiefe profaners of the Sabbath in the burning lake, and vnquenchable fire.
            O Lord, let no wicked temptation of sathan, or of my flesh, enter into my minde in the hearing of thy Word, to make it vnsauourie, or bitter vnto my soule, but let it be this day and euer, more sweet vnto my soule, then honey vnto my lips.
            O Lord, let it be in some measure, my meate and drinke to doe thy will; and graunt that I may this day, learne so much thereof, that I may become wiser then my Teachers, or those that regard not to keepe thy law, graunt all these my requests, most louing Lord, both to mee and all thine, this day and for euermore.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            A Prayer for godly zeale.
            O Lord, knowing that zeale doth sauour our knowledge,

sweeten our vnderstanding, confirme our faith, and make acceptable all our sacrifices and seruices vnto thee; and being a most excellent and perfect gift that commeth from thee, the Father of gifts, and how all thy seruants, Moses, Iosuah, Phineas, Sampson, Dauid, S. Paul, and Stephen, and all the rest of the Prophets and holy Martyrs, both ancient and late haue abounded herein. I doe prostrate and cast downe my selfe, before thy most high Maiestie: beseeching thee to giue mee this coale from thine Altar, that I may delight my soule to be talking, and singing thy continuall praise, and inflame my spirit, (like the men that trauailed to Emmaus) to be astonied in admiration and contemplation of thy exceeding loue. O God my Sauiour, let not my zeale be headie, preposterous, or ignorant zeale, that there with I may neither offend thee, disquiet thy Church, or afflict my selfe, as

the Scribes and Pharisees in Ierusalem, and the Israelites in the absence of Moses, at mount Sinah: or as Saul in his Pharisaicall deuotion, giue me not knowledge without zeale, nor zeale without knowledge, and that all my vnderstanding in thy Word, may euermore bee mixed with true zeale: O let not my zeale be aboue knowledge, lest while I thinke to serue thee in the breath of charity, by the distemper thereof, I bee inforced to dishonour and blaspheme thee, as the blinde Heathen, ignorant Papists, or vndiscreete Protestants at this day doe. Graunt this, O Lord, for the honour of my Aduocate and Mediatour Iesus Christ.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            A feruent Prayer vnto God, that the repentant may finde fauour in Christ.
            
               ATtend vnto my teares, O Lord,
               regard my wofull moane:
               And seeke to saue me by thy Word,
               or I am ouerthrowne.
               For sinne doth so oppresse my minde,
               that I am damn'd to hell,
               Vnlesse by Christ I fauour finde,
               whose wounds must make me well.
            
            
               Cure thou my soule so sicke with sinne,
               by merits of thy Sonne:
               Marke not the estate that I liue in,
               but marke what he hath done.
               Most perfect hee (though I be vilde)
               to please when I offend:
               He sits with thee, (though I exilde)
               in glory to the end.
            
            
               My nature is inclin'd to euill,
               though his with good accord:
               My sences seeke to serue the deuill,
               his will to please the Lord.
               
                  
Wherefore, O God, that art most iust,
               in him my debts to pay:
               In his desert my soule doth trust
               thy wrath for to allay.
            
            
               O Father, full of knowledge deepe,
               thou searchest secrets of each heart;
               Beholdst desires wee priuate keepe,
               with hidden silence in the darke:
               But yet thou doest thus much require,
               thy children should know and confesse:
               Thee for to be their lightsome fire,
               that iudgest their workes in righteousnesse.
            
            
               As thou hast fram'd in man a heart.
               wherewith his Maker to beleeue,
               A tongue, and lips, and euery part,
               wherewith he glory may thee giue.
               And thou doest chalenge at his hands,
               free sacrifice of prayers praise:
               And honours due throughout all lands,
               that all men canst deiect and raise.
            
            
               Thy Children must not in their minde
               be dumbe, nor in their tongues be mute,
               When they should seeke thy helpe to finde,
               and by petition shew their suite.
               
                  
Thy Sonne doth bid me aske and haue,
               and finde to seeke, to knock to enter.
               What they doe want, that they may craue,
               by faith in him they may aduenture.
            
            
               Thou still art ready to be found,
               and helpe thine owne in their distresse,
               That in their faith are constant found,
               and patient in their heauinesse.
               Therefore, deare Father, I beset
               with many miseries distrest:
               Come vnto thee thine ayde to get,
               and after trouble to finde rest.
            
            
               And haue thy Grace without, within:
               but I that am of sinners chiefe:
               Because thou hat'st in me my sinne,
               they doubt thou wilt not giue reliefe:
               Alas poore wretch what shall I doe?
               to aske I am so farre vnfit,
               Vnapt, my God, to aske vnto,
               vnworthy to haue benefit.
            
            
               Of what I craue, or doe desire,
               and yet to cry I will not linne:

               and purifie me from my sinne.
            
         
         
            
            A Prayer for the obtaining of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and all Christian vertues.
            O Lord, and Father of lights, from whom proceedeth euery good and perfect gift: I beseech thee to blesse mee with all spirituall blessings in heauenly things in Christ. Increase the little graine of my weake and feeble Faith, direct it to the true obiect, the merits of Christ Iesus, and let it not be bare and bad, but effectually working by loue. Make me strong therein, and constant to giue credit to thy Word without doubting, and protect mee among the diuers and manifold errors, sects, and heresies of this world that fight against the foundation. Lord let me not be disappointed of my hope which I haue in thee: but make good thy promises vnto mee, and so worke in

my heart, that I may haue courage in conflict, patience in trouble, and comfort in all things. Keepe mee from insolencie and pride, and graunt mee true humility, and lowlinesse of minde, that I bee not puffed vp to contemne my brethren, but giue mee that due consideration of my owne vilenesse, and infirmities, that as dust and ashes I may tremble, and stand in awe of thy Iudgements, and as a sinfull man, esteeme better of others then my selfe. O deare Father, when Sathan shall accuse mee, my owne conscience beare witnesse against mee, the whole world forsake mee, and all things set themselues against mee for my sinnes; then strengthen mee in thy Faith, that I fall not from thee: inflame my cold heart with the vnfained affection of heauenly loue, that I may loue thee (O blessed Trinity) withall that I haue, aboue all, &amp; my neighbour as my selfe.
            
               
Graunt me a compassionate and a charitable minde, to helpe and succour others to my ability, to forbeare and forgiue them though they bee mine enemies. Inflame me with loue and charity towards all men, to forgiue and forget, to doe good, to pray for them, that I may follow the steps of my Sauiour: open the eyes of my vnderstanding, and helpe me to examine my selfe, concerning my knowledge, faith, and repentance: send me the hunger and thirst after righteousnesse, and make mee verily and fully partaker of all the benefits of that bitter passion of my Lord &amp; Sauiour Iesus Christ, To whom with thee and thy most holy Spirit, be all honour and glory, this day and for euermore.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            The sighes and meditations of an afflicted conscience.
            O Most mercifull God, which by the sending of thy Sonne

into the world, hast brought to passe, that where sinne abounded, there grace abounded much more, I forlorne wretch disquieted in minde and afflicted in conscience, for feare of thy Iudgements vpon my sinne, doe with bended knees and teares vnfained, a most humble Suppliant, begge and craue of thee some succour and reliefe; open, open the gates of thy mercies to the greatnesse of my miseries: my abiect countenance witnesseth my distressed minde. My spirit is sorrowfull, my heart is heauie, my words are stopt with sighes, and my plants watered with teares: to thee I hold vp my hands, to thee I lift vp my heart, to thee 
                  〈◊〉

            O Lord heare me speedily: if thou doe not, I shall be helplesse and hopelesse, for my conscience accuseth mee, my memory giues euidence against me, and my reason condemneth me.

            A Prayer in affliction or aduersity.
            MOst mercifull Redeemer, which art alwayes full of compassion, thou art alwayes our preseruer, whether thou sendest vs aduersity or prosperity, for great is thy mercy and compassion, in that thou healest the inward man by outward afflictions, as it were by bitter medicines, and preparest vs to euerlasting ioyes, by temporall troubles. And forasmuch as thou thy selfe hast traced vs out this true way to felicity by thine owne footesteps: graunt that I may patiently and obediently drink this cup, which thou reachest vnto me.
            Grieuous indeede are these things vnto my nature, but yet thou hast suffered grienouser things for mee: and I haue deserued farre grieuouser things then these, for I haue deserued hell

fire. Notwithstanding,

If thou think meet to encrease our griefes, encrease thou also the gift of patience, and graunt that these afflictions may turne vs to the amendment of our sinfull deedes: or if thy fatherly louing kindnesse thinke this thy gentle chastisement to be sufficient: let this storme

               ruant by gentlenesse; as also for that thou hast remooued the cup of affliction, or allayed the bitternesse of it, by the sweetnesse of thy mercie. To thee

            Meditations vpon the passion of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.

               ourges, stripes, &amp; grieous wounds, crowned with a Garland of thornes, pricking and piercing to the braine, and thus fastned to an ignominious Crosse? What heauie or haynous crime hath hee done, to deserue this intollerable and vnspeakeable torment? What Iudge could bee so cruell to sentence him to it? or what remorcelesse or mercilesse Executioners could be found to deale so outragiously with this tender and peerelesse body. Notwithstanding

the deformity of these bloudie wounds, yet is this matchlesse body fairer then the Sonnes of men. Surely it is Iesus Christ the Sonne of the liuing God: Oh hee is my Lord and Sauiour Iesus that is thus crucified for my sin, and for my sake. Oh, art thou he that excellest all men in beauty 
                  〈◊〉

                guile, and from whom proceeded such gracious words as neuer man spake? where then is that beauty of thine? where is that grace of thy lippes? Oh, I see it not, I finde it not, fleshly eyes conceiue not so great a mysterie: open thou the eyes of my minde, bring thy diuine light neerer vnto me, and bring mee powerfully and more seriously to behold thee in this thine agony and passion.
            I see it is Iesus the Son of God, the vnspotted Lambe, without sinne, without fault, without offence, which tooke my wickednesse vpon him, to the intent that

I being set free from sinne, might bee brought againe into Gods fauour, rise againe from my fall: returne home againe from banishment, and attaine the end for which I was created: that which I deserued, he suffered, and that which I could neuer attaine vnto, 
                  •
               e giueth.
            O my Redeemer, deliuerer, and Sauiour, draw me to thee, that being alwaies mindfull of thy death, trusting alwayes in thy goodnes, and being alwayes thankfull for thy vnspeakeable benefits, I may bee made partaker of so great reward, and not bee seperated from thee, through mine owne vnthankfulnesse: Oh let not thy most humble inuestment of humanity bee in vaine in respect of me, nor thy vnspeakeable (and by thee alone endured) torments be in-effectuall, but valuable and all-sufficient for the eternall saluation of my soule and body: whom thou hast redeemed and sanctified

with that thy most glorious and inestimable blood, shed at the time of Passion vpon the Crosse.
            2. Oh, I behold thee, crucified for my soule: Oh that thou wouldest also crucifie mee with thee, that I might vtterly die in all carnall affections, and so liue to thee, or rather my sweet Sauiour thou in me, then should I rest perfectly assured (as by faith in thee and thy promises I doe) to liue in thee, and to arise by thee and with thee to life euerlasting: thy flesh is crucified, O Christ: crucifie thou the power of sinne that raigneth in mee: graunt I may put off the old man, and vtterly abollish the whole body of sinne, and be freed from all wickednesse, vnbeliefe, hardnesse of heart, and dominion of all manner sinne and Sathan. Let thy yoke become sweet, and thy burthen lightsome to mee, through thy most grieuous Passion.
            3. O most high &amp; mighty singular

obedience, where-through thou diddest submit thy selfe to innumerable torments, yea euen to a most grieuous, most bitter and most reproachfull death, because thy heauenly Father (for the Redemption of mankinde) had decreed it so. O splendour and brightnesse of thy Fathers glory, O Sun of righteousnesse, alwayes shining full of grace and glory, shew vs where thou feedest in the heat of the day, and where thou shrowdest thy Sheepe from the colde, and thy little Lambes from the stormes of thy Fathers burning wrath and fearefull indignation: Oh that wee might bee transformed into that liuely and sensible Image of thy Passion, that wee might alwayes dwell in thee, and thou in our hearts by faith, rooted, and grounded in charity, so as wee might with all thy holy ones, comprehend the length, bredth, height, &amp;

               eepnes of thine agony &amp; bitter passion.
            
               
4. I see a wonderfull kinde of loue, thy highnesse boweth down the head, that wee might be certainely assured that thou wilt graciously heare vs and helpe vs, thou offerest the kisse of reconciliation and attonement, yea and that of thine owne accord, being the party grieued and wronged, vnto vs that haue done the wrong. Thou reachest out thine armes to embrace vs: thou stretchest out thy bored hands to giue vs all things abundantly without holding any thing back: thy side is open to thine heart to receiue vs in thither, if wee will enter in at the open dore, thy feete are fast nailed to the intent, that wee may know thou wilt neuer depart from vs, if wee depart not from thee. O Father and Lord of ours, thou seest the hardnesse of our heart, and much rather the dulnesse of it. It is not enough for vs to bee allured and called so gently, so sweetly, and

so louingly; but thou must bee faigne euen to draw vs, pull vs, and violently hale vs vnto thee: create new and obedient hearts in vs, for this wee haue is more vngentle then the cursed Iewes, and more hard then the stones that cloue in compassion of thine innocent and yet most cruell Passion.
            5. O Lord Iesus Christ, the euerlasting sweetnesse, and triumph of them that loue thee, exceeding all ioy and all longing, thou sauer and louer of repentant sinners, which doest acknowledge thy delight to be among the children of men, and therefore in the end of times becammest man for mans sake: Remember all the sorrowes which thou didst endure, euen from the instant of thy conception in thy humane nature, and from thy cradle to thy crosse. Remember the bitter sorrow which thou didst suffer and endure when thou saydest, My

soule is heauy euen vnto death. And at the institution of the commemoration of thy death, when thou didst wash thy Disciples feete, &amp; comforting them sweetly, toldest them of thy Passion that was at hand: Remember the sorrow, anguish, and griefe, which thou didst suffer throughout thy whole tender body, before thy suffering vpon the Crosse, at such time as after thrice praying, thou didst sweat water like to blood, was betrayed by one of thine owne Disciples, apprehended by thine owne chosen people, accused by false witnesses, condemned wrongfully by three Iudges in thy chosen Citie, at the time of the Passeouer, in the flourishing youth of thy body: and being vtterly guiltlesse, was deliuered to the cruell Iewes, bespetted, stript out of thine owne garment, cloathed with another bodies apparell, buffeted, blinde-folded, and smitten with sinfull fists, bound,

scourged, and crowned with thornes.
            6. O most sweet Iesus, I beseech thee make mee mindfull of these thy paines and sufferings which thou hast endured for my sinnes, that I might bee discharged, and set free from them, and my reconciliation and peace bee made with thy Father through thy chastisement, by whose sorrowfull stripes wee are healed: make mee to abhor all such hatefull sinne, and cursed disobedience, which could not be put away, without thy so grieuous punishments. Make me to be heartily sorrie, for my sinfulnesse, and to eschue mine offences, which draw thee to the suffering of so great torments: make mee mindfull of thy great loue to me, and to all mankinde, and let the infinitenesse thereof kindle an vnfaigned loue in me towards thee and my neighbour. Let this thy vnmeasurable goodnesse breede in me a

willing minde, and desire to abide all things patiently for thy sake, and for the truth of thy Gospell: And let it ingender in mee, a despising of all worldly and earthly things, and an earnestly longing, and endeauour to attaine to the heauenly inheritance for the purchasing whereof vnto me, and for the bringing of mee thereunto, thou hast indured these, &amp; al other thy most bitter, and intollerable torments, at the time of thine agony and passion.
            Wherefore I beseech thee grant me true repentance, amendment of life, perseuerance in all goodnesse, a stedfast faith, and a happy death through the merits of thy sufferings, that I may a so bee made partaker of thy blessed Resurrection. Amen.
            
            7. O Lord Iesus, the very freedome of the Angels, and the pleasure of Paradise, remember the terrour and griefe which thou didst endure at the time, when as

all thine enemies stood round about thee like a sort of roaring Lyons, vexing thee with buffetings, spettings, scratchings, and other intollerable dealings, and martvring thee with reproachfull words, grieuous stripes, and most grieuous torments. I beseech thee, O Lord, for thine owne sake, and for thy exceeding great mercies sake, which caused thee to endure and suffer these things, for our redemption; deliuer mee from all mine enemies, visible and inuisible, and graunt that I may finde protection in this life, and endlesse felicity in the life to come. Amen. Amen.
            
            O Lord, the Creatour and framer of the world, whom no measure can comprehend within bounds, and which holdest the earth in thine hand; call to minde thy most bitter paine which thou didst endure, when they nayled thy most holy hands to the Cross, and likewise pearced through thy

most tender feete, making thy wounds still more and more painfull, and so drawing and stretching out thy body to the length and breadth of the crosse: I beseech thee graunt that my continuall minding of this thy most holy and bitter paines vpon the Crosse, may also cause me to stand in awe of thee, and also to loue thee with an vnquenchable loue.
            8. O Iesus, the heauenly Phisitian, remember the anguish, paine, and griefe, which thou diddest suffer by the renting, crucifying, &amp; tearing of all the parts of thy body, when thou wert lifted vp, and nayled to the Crosse: insomuch as there was not any one of them whole and vnbruised, so that there was neuer any paine found like vnto thine: for there was not any place of thee left whole, from the sole of the foote, to the crowne of the head, and yet euen then (vnmindfull of all thy paines) thou prayedst earnestly

and mildly for thine enemies, saying: Father, forgiue them, for they know not what they doe, I beseech thee by thy louing kindnes and mercie, which caused thee to suffer these paines for my sake, let thy passion be the full satisfaction, absolution, and pardon for all my sinnes. Amen.
            
            9. O Iesus, the mirrour of eternall brightnesse, and fountaine of vnconsumeable goodnesse, which crucifying vpō the Cross, didst thirst for the saluation of mankinde. I beseech thee kindle in vs the desire of all good works, &amp; quench in vs the thirst and concupiscence of all fleshly lusts, and both coole and kill in vs the loue of all worldly delight. O Princely Iesus, the strength and triumph of our minds, which for our sakes didst suffer such anguish of heart, that the bitternesse of thy death, and the exclamation of the Iewes, vpbraiding and reuiling thee, made thee to cry out

with a loude voyce: O God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? I beseech thee forsake mee not in my distresse; but bee at hand to comfort mee, and deliuer me, especially at the time of death. O Iesu, the bottomlesse sea of all mercy, I beseech thee by the deepe wounds, which pearced through thy flesh, into the marrow of thy bones, and into the very bowels of thee; pull me out of the gulph of my sinnes, and hide mee in the holes of thy wounds, from the sight of thy Fathers iust wrath, vntill his displeasure be ouer-past.
            10. O Lord, the mirrour of truth, the standard of vnity, and the bond of charity, remember thine innumerable wounds wherwith thou wert torne from top to toe by the wicked Iewes, so that thou wert all on a gore blood: which torment thou didst suffer in that most holy body of thine for our sakes: O most sweet and

milde Iesus, leauing nothing vndone on thy behalfe, that might be for our benefit. I beseech thee write the memoriall of these thy bloody wounds in my heart, with thy most pretious blood, that in them I may reade thy great loue towards mee: let the remembrance of them be layd vp continually in the closet of my heart, that the consideration of the paines and griefes which thou sufferedst for my sake in thy passion, may make mee to loue thee more and more, and neuer to giue ouer, vntill I be come vnto the treasure of all goodnesse &amp; ioyes, which I beseech thee to graunt me for thine owne sake, O most sweet Iesus. Amen.
            
            11. O Iesu, the onely begotten Sonne of the heauenly Father, and the brightnesse and Image of his substance, remember thy heartie commending of thy spirit into thy Fathers hands, when hauing thy body all torne, and thy heart

full of anguish, and sorrow, and the curse of our bloody sinnes pressed thee euen to the death, and to the expiration of thy humane soule. I beseech thee for this thy pretious deaths sake, O King of Saints, giue mee strength to withstand the deuill, the world and the flesh, that being dead to the world, I may liue onely vnto thee: And whensoeuer this wayfaring and banished poore soule of mine, shall depart hence, I beseech thee receiue it home into the hands and protection of thy mercy, and graunt it may be deare and pretious in thy sight, and liue and remaine with thee in glory for euermore. Amen.
            
            12. O Iesus, the true &amp; fruitfull vine, remember the abundant flowing out, and shedding of thy blood, which thou didst send out of thy body most plentifully, as out of Grapes, pressed at the wine-presse, at which time as thou didst tread the wine-fatte

alone, and begannest to vs of the cup of water and wine, which streamed forth out of thy most glorious side. I beseech thee O most sweet Iesus, by this most bitter death of thine, and by the shedding of thy most pretious blood: wound my heart with such repentance of my sinnes, and

            In the pangues of death, and in all tribulations, the Remedies to be learned in the sufferings of Christ.
            
               VVHat's death? a seperation
               of mortall body from our breath,
               What's that? but a cessation,
               from cares, and from a liuing death.
               What's that cessation? Why, it is a sleepe,
               by which we wholly are refreshed:
               
                  
Yea but in sleepe, who shall vs keepe?
               euen he that guards his owne redeemed.
            
            
               But who made death? it was made by sinne,
               and what is sinne? the lawes transgression:
               Of that how should I vantage winne?
               all sinne is weakened by confession.
               But by death's dint, 'tis ouercome,
               and whence came sinne? from hell beneath?
               When was't first bred? in Mothers wombe:
               when will it end? not till our death.
            
            
               This seemeth strange, but this is true,
               by nature sinne is hatch'd in vs,
               Old Adams Rules, till God renue.
               Why then I see the case stands thus.
               As sinne goes in, so life goes out:
               as sinne goes out, so life comes in:
               So by the Lord 'tis brought about,
               sinne conquers life, life conquers sinne.
            
            
               Though life by sinne be still annoy'd.
               and sinne of death by strength and sting:
               Yet viprous sinne by death's destroy'd,
               life killeth death, when death kills sinne,
               The death of body, or of nature,
               is that where to all subiect bee:
               
                  
Cause sinne hath taintod euery creature,
               according vnto Gods decree.
            
            
               When bodies life doth 
                     •
                  ade away,
               and we giue vp our dying ghost:
               And th
                     •…
                   our corpes is clad in clay,
               and vnto God our soul
                     •
                  s doth post:
               It is ordained and decreed,
               that all men by necessity,
               Through that first Adams sinfull deede,
               are subiect, made the death to dye.
            
            
               To dye for sinne, 'tis due for sinne,
               to aye in sinne a heauie case,
               To dye to sinne is to beginne,
               to leaue our sinne and liue to grace;
               The death in sinne without repenting,
               in affect, effect, and aspecting
               In thinking, doing, and frequenting,
               and offered grace of God reiecting.
            
            
               I wretched wofull execrable,
               haue plague of God, by sinne, for sinne,
               Of miseries most miserable,
               to them that liue and dye therein:
               But he that dies, before he dies,
               when he is dead, he is not dead,
               
                  
But old age dies, and he shall rise,
               with glory from the graue his bed.
            
            
               And he that's toucht with conscience pricke,
               whose sence of sinne is sharpe and quicke,
               That man is sicke ere he is sicke,
               and when he's sicke, he is not sicke.
               I looke poore wretch on mine estate,
               and others monish by mine harmes:
               That was neere death but now of late,
               by sinne enchanted by her charmes.
            
            
               Had I not dyed, sure I had dide,
               O happy Phaenix liuing death,
               Still let my flesh be mortifide,
               O let me breath a liuing breath.
               Sweet Iesus thou didst dye for me,
               and in thy death with thee I dide,
               O liue in me, and I in thee
               shall liue, and euermore abide.
            
            
               And wormes meate thou, durt, clay &amp; slime,
               kill carnall lust thy soule to saue:
               Quaile vild affections, whilst hast time,
               that life through death, by grace maist haue:
               Shake hands with sinnes and all offences,
               and learne to dye, before thou dye.
               
                  
When bidst adiew vnto thy sences,
               then shalt thou liue eternally.
            
         
         
            The cause of death.
            
               The cause of death is wicked sinne,
               for out of sinne, our death did flowe:
               From thence did all our plagues begin
               out of this tree, our ills did growe.
               Hunger, fire, death, and all,
               created were for punishment:
               And layd on man for Adams fall,
               and was the cause of our torment.
            
            
               God said to Adam, Scripture saith,
               what houre soeuer thou shalt eate,
               Thou shalt be sure to dye the death;
               doe thou not taste forbidden meate:
               Through enuious malice of the deuill,
               into the world came this estate:
               Sinnes entered with all actions euill
               by Adams fault, not by our Fate.
            
            
               Two sorts of death, from death by sinne,
               proceedes as effects from their cause:
               The death of nature, doth begin,
               and death of grace next by Gods lawes.
               
                  
By which we are made slaues for euer
               in darknesse, called death eternall:
               From worme of conscience freed neuer,
               depriu'd of all the ioyes supernall.
            
            
               As by example euident,
               two sorts of death approued well:
               The glutton rich to hell was sent,
               his body buried quick in hell.
               And Lazarus poore beggar dead,
               to Abrahams bosome carried is:
               With Angels wings with glory spread,
               where is true ioy, and comforts blisse:
               The one hath heauen, the other hell,
               the one hath blisse, the other bale:
               The one in heauen still must dwell,
               and the other deuils pull and hale.
            
            
               He died with his conscience euill,
               in death he sawe his wickednesse:
               And his damnations with the deuill,
               as holy Scriptures doe expresse,
               This is the consolation great,
               of them that in their death-beds lie,
               Their mindes flie vp to the mercy seate,
               and there for mercy lowdly crie:
               By Christ which death abollished,
               
                  
and sinne that's cleans'd by his blood:
               Whose merits, pardon purchased
               for all our sinnes, and death withstood.
            
            
               To vs his goodnesse is imputed,
               to him the sinnes that we committed:
               And we for righteous are reputed,
               and all our sinnes they are remitted:
               For he alone by death hath bought vs
               from power and paine, of deuill, of hell:
               Beat Sathan downe with iron rod,
               to place where damned spirits dwell.
            
            
               Eternall death could not preuaile,
               'gainst him, nor ouer him haue power:
               Christ strengthned those whom sinne did quaile;
               his might; the mighty did deuoure.
               O're death, o're sinne and hideous hell,
               he gaue vs life and victory:
               To all those that keepe his precepts well,
               and them enstalls in endlesse glory.
            
            
               For as by Adam all men dyed,
               for sinne and by iniquity:
               In Christ shall all men be reuiu'd,
               to liue with him eternally:
               The godly and iust people haue
               
                  
most comfort, though with paine and griefe:
               They suffer death, and lye in graue,
               and seeme forsaken saue reliefe.
            
            
               They are sheepe which men ordaine,
               to death and slaughter to be put:
               As silly guiltlesse Lambes are slaine,
               when Butchers knifes their threats doe cut:
               For we which liue shall giuen be,
               to death, for Jesus Christ his sake,
               If they doe not dispaire in thee,
               no feare of death can cause them quake.
            
            
               But rest assured they shall passe,
               through death to life eternally:
               Who aske for mercy and for grace,
               and vnto God for Faith doe cry.
               They suffer both his hand and rod,
               and when he strikes, are patieut:
               They put their hope, and trust in God,
               who comforts them with hearts content.
            
            
               Their death is good and of great price,
               they also know through Christ his passion:
               Death's ouercome in wonderous wise,
               and so receiue they consolation.
               If any touch'd in latest paines
               
                  
of dire full death this faith holds fast,
               In midst of death his li
                     •
                  t attaines,
               and shall haue lasting life at last:
               The Christians surely doe beleeue,
               that when they seeme to be most dead,
               That then they most of all doe liue,
               and so with ioy lift vp their head,
            
            
               Christ calls the death of godly men
               a sleepe, his owne a death, and why?
               The souldiers speare was made a pen,
               his blood the Inke to write thereby
               
                  Quietus est, for-Christians all,
               and then the same to vs was sealed:
               A sleepe he iustly may it call,
               cause by his stripes our wounds were healed.
            
            
               His was a death, cause death was due,
               in him di'd all, he died for all:
               Gods Iustice vs to death doth sue,
               he pay'd it, and repair'd the fall,
               That we might sleepe, he suffered paines,
               that we might laugh he oft did weepe:
               His was the losse, ours was the gaines,
               thus did he change death to a sleepe.
            
            
               
               To Christ did Stephen yeeld vp his spirit,
               for he's the way, the truth, the life:
               He purchast life by death and merit:
               the husband's he, the Church his wife:
               He is that Noah, his Church the Doue,
               that holds his hand for to receiue vs;
               He bids vs come to embrace his Loue,
               we flye to him when all deceiues vs.
            
            
               The heauens, the earth, the Lord commands,
               to him all creatures runne but wee:
               None can vs take out of his hands,
               in life and death to him we flee.
               Pillar of faith: Basis of blisse,
               of true Religion, true supporter,
               The point of Resurrection is,
               in death it is the chiefe Comforter,
               If this doe fall, all faith may faile,
               what Article doth vs refresh:
               When life, and health, and strength doth quaile,
               the Resurrection of the flesh.
            
            
               Our bones shall blossome as the grasse,
               we shall be raised out of dust:
               The body that before time was,
               by Christ his power arise it must:
               The first fruits Christ the head is rais'd,
               
                  
the members shall the same likewise:
               The Lord God for the same be prais'd,
               we know that we shall also rise.
               If he ad aboue the water be,
               how can the body then be drowned,
               We shall arise, and Iesus see,
               and with him shall be Kingly crowned.
            
            
               Of life and death the true directour,
               who in his life and in his dying,
               Of our misdoing is Correctour,
               and into all our actions prying.
               Christ is afflicted for our sake,
               left vs example that we should
               Follow his steps, and his way take,
               thy crosse to beare with courage bold.
            
            
               Our Sauiour Iesus teacheth thee,
               how can that be (say'st thou) behold
               Example, if thou punish'd be,
               with sicknesse, hunger, thirst and cold:
               With thy selfe reckon and account,
               how it cannot compared be
               With his thornes, his nayles surmount,
               the greatest paine that paineth thee.
            
            
               
               Art thou restrain'd of thy desire,
               and lusts that draw thou know'st not whither:
               Thinke on Christs Crosse, his wrath and ire,
               and put his tortures all together.
               If pride puffe vp thy minde with motions,
               looke on Christ nayl'd on the Crosse:
               And thinke as bound by due deuotions,
               of our great gaine, by his great losse.
            
            
               If thou in filthy lust doest burne,
               or any other ill desire:
               Thinke but how Christ his flesh was torne,
               to saue thy soule from flames of fire.
               With stripes thrust through, and all to broken
               his drinke was Eysell mixt with gall,
               With his last gaspe, the earth was shaken,
               who suffered for the sinnes of all.
            
            
               If enuie, hate, reuenge thee grieue,
               thinke with thy selfe how Christ did pray:
               O Father, doe them all forgiue,
               for them that tooke his life away.
               God vs commanded to forgiue,
               and sayeth then we shall be forgiuen:
               Without offence no man can liue,
               and God his ballance hangeth euen.

               And when you kneele to God, and pray,
               forgiue, if you haue any thing
               Gainst any liuing man that day,
               that Christ may you remission bring:
               And when thy gift thou do'st present,
               and on the Altar sacrifice:
               First with thy brother make consent,
               and him forgiue in any wise,
            
            
               When thou to Christ wast enemie,
               and strengthened in great extreames:
               Yet then did he giue remedie,
               and o're thee spread his mercy beames:
               He gaue to thee his holy spirit,
               to guide and leade thy soule aright:
               And gaue thee heauen there to inherit,
               all ioyes and blisse aye in his sight.
            
            
               When thou from him was gone astray,
               be sought thee out, and did thee finde,
               And finding thee, brought thee away,
               vnto his fold he thee resignde:
               Thanke God therefore, and render praise,
               
                  
exalt and laude his holy name:
               Vnto the heauens sing alwayes:
               All men on earth doe yee the same.
            
            
               Henceforth my soule walke in his path,
               and erre not from him any more:
               Lest thou prouoke his heauy wrath,
               and then art worse then wert before.
               Let not Gods gifts be giuen thee,
               to worke thy condemnation:
               With feare and trembling walke sincere,
               confirming thy Saluation.
            
            
               Shunne thou all wicked Company,
               with doers ill associate not:

               and soule and body soile and spot.
               But blesse his name who called thee,
               vnto the state of righteousnesse,
               And thy sinnes vengeance tane hath he,
               to giue thee heauens happinesse.
            
            
               Blesse thou his blessed Holinesse,
               his praise let heart and minde record:

               since he made, sau'd, and blest each part.
            
            
               Who spared not his onely Sonne,
               but let him dye thy soule to saue:
               To pay and ransome thy faults done,
               and to redeeme thee from the graue:
               So in the Prayer of our Lord,
               we doe forgiue what's done against vs:
               As God forgiuenesse shall afford,
               our Sauiour Christ doth teach vs thus.
            
         
         
            A Prayer to beare patiently the Crosse of Christ or any affliction: And if God so please to call vs to that triall, euen to reioyce in Martyrdome.
            O Almighty God, most mercifull and louing Father, that hast decrced, that through manifold tribulations and afflictions in this world, we that trust in thee, must enter into the Kingdome of

heauen. And those that will follow thee my Sauiour, and be thy Disciples, must take vpon them by the constraint of the world, as Simon of Cyrene to beare thy Crosse, and to follow thee, and those that liue godly in thy Son, must suffer reproach and affliction. And that there is neuer a Son whom thou louest, but must like Peter drinke of thy Cup, and endure chastening. And in so doing, thou offerest thy selfe an assured louing Father, and assurest vs that wee are thy sonnes: because it is giuen vs, not onely to beleeue in thee, but also that wee should suffer for his names sake. O Lord, I am willing not onely to liue with thee, but also to dye with thee. My Spirit is willing, though my flesh bee weake. Wherefore if it bee possible, let this bitter Cup passe from me, or if thou please, and hast appointed, that I by death should glorifie thee, and with my blood seale

and confirme thy truth: sweet Iesus giue mee strength, comfort, and patience, blessed be thy name, and thy most holy will be done.
            O Lord manifest thy power in my weakenesse, and strengthen me, that I may by the same power, whereby thou raisest thy selfe from death to life, patiently beare, and willingly suffer that for thy name sake, which otherwise for flesh and blood seemeth fearefull to be endured: O Lord, when I consider the hazards that wee runne through, for the obtaining of these present profits, and delights of this life, and with what vnwearied paines wee prosecute the winning of this worlds vanities, that in the end are nothing worth, but to pamper the body, and make it vpon euery slight occasion most willing to deny thee. O Lord, when I consider the pleasure of this world, and the abundance of content I haue in this life, wanting nothing for my bodie.

Oh what a Coward doth it make mee, that with the young man, that was most ready to follow thee; yet when thou biddest him sell all his worldly riches, and follow thee, (O simple man) hee neuer came at thee more: So me thinkes I feele Sathan to say vnto me; What a foole art thou to leaue father, or m

                  •
               s, a certainty for an vncertainty to follow thee. O Lord, how am I tempted by the Papists, the Enemies of the Gospell, to think this way foolishnesse, a Sect and heresie lately risen, and seperated from the Church, meaning themselues. Oh how they doe tempt mee by the examples of my 
                  •
               ore-fathers, that for many gen
                  •
               rations, time out of minde, haue liued and died in the Romish Religion, and why should I thinke my selfe wiser then they.
            O heauenly Father, see and behold these subtill instruments of

Sathan, and keepe me that these crafty baytes of Sathan arising from the flesh and the world, preuaile not ouer me, (that like Peter in the water) or the young man I let goe my true faith, not to beleeue in lyes and errours, and so finally forsake thee, who hath so dearely loued me, and bought me. But O God my Sauiour, strengthen my faith that I be not moued, to let goe my first loue, with which I haue been so much comforted in thee. O strengthen me, that neither Sathan by himselfe, nor by his Antichristian Instruments, which hee ruleth at his pleasure, preuaile against me, either to doubt of my faith, much lesse to denie thee my Lord and Sauiour, but as thou for my sake, didst not contemne nor despise the reproach of the wicked, nor yet the cursed death of the Cross: but for the ioy that was set before thee, and which thou hadst with the Father before the world

was, endured the same, and though thou wert reuiled, yet thou reuilest not againe, but with infinite patience committed thy cause to thy Father: So, O Lord, graunt that by my faith in thy power, I may bee no lesse assured of patience, in the greatest torment, that shall be inflicted vpon my body. For I know that although they kill my body, yet they cannot touch my soule, but that it shall liue with thee for euer. And in despight of their malice, while they thinke to destroy my soule with death, they shall extract my spirit into glorious life, with God the Father, and his Christ for euermore. Sweet Sauiour, as Sampson in his death triumphed most gloriously ouer his enemies: so graunt to me that they seeing my patience, and beholding my vnmoueable hope, may be so ashamed, and in their conscience so affrighted (that they may like Saul, at the death

of Stephen) be conuerted, and after their change of minde, magnifie as most pretious the death of thy Saints, and by preaching the truth, strengthen the brethren, and stand fast in the Faith vnto the end. O Lord strengthen mee, that I may not faint vnder the crosse, because thou hast appointed vs thereunto, that in thy crosse, wee should be more then conquerours, and by his example, whose steps we should onely follow, account our selues most happy, that thou wilt call vs, and grace vs, to lay downe our liues for his name sake, as thou hast layd downe thy life for our sakes. O God, if the righteous scarcely be saued, (as it seemeth vnto the world, through these bitter torments, with which wee are to be scourged, and made cleane vessels to serue thee in thy Kingdome) where shall the wicked and sinners, which regard not thy crosse, appeare? O Lord, being confident

of thy mercy, in the merits of thy Sonne, doe I submit my selfe in soule and body, to doe seruice and sacrifice vnto thee, as vnto a faithfull Creatour, knowing that a crowne of glory remaineth for mee. Father, into thy hands doe I commend my spirit, Lord Jesus after death receiue my soule, as thou hast all those braue champions, that were slaine with the sword, that wandered about in Sheepe-skins, and Goat-skins, and thought it better to liue with beasts in woods and dennes to enioy thee, then to liue among men, Gentiles, and Antichristians, and denie thee, being destitute, afflicted, and tormented, wandering in Desarts, mountaines, and dens, and holes of the earth, to auoyde the beastly and cruell enemies of thy word.
            O Lord, as thou hast made thy wrath smoke against the Heathens, the Assirians, the Egyptians, the Moabites, the Ammonites,

that first trampled vnder foote the blood of thy Saints, by labouring an vtter consuming of them: So, O Lord, either graunt the conuersion, or else let thine indignation appeare in these our dayes, against the Turkes, Heretikes, Athiests, and all Antichristian enemies, that like Herod and Iulian, obstinately persecute and scorne thy name.
            And this, though a most vnworthy Suppliant, I beseech thee to graunt, and that for the honour of thy great name, in which thy true Church doth onely trust.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            A thanksgiuing for Gods temporall and spirituall blessings.
            O Most bountifull and kinde Creatour, vnto thee in Christ Iesus doe I come, and returne most humble and heartie thankes, not onely for the generall

goodnesse, which thou hast extended vnto all mankinde, but for that especiall part, which thou hadst diuided vnto mee in more speciall manner. O Lord, I giue thee most humble thankes and praise, for that portion of thy blessings, set forth vnto mee to my present vse and comfort in this life: as for thy daily preseruations of mee, not onely in the wombe of my parents: but for my safety in my birth, that I was not mishapen in breeding, nor in comming forth into this world, and that after my birth, in the time of my swadling bands, infancie, childhood, and youth, no mishap, nor mishape befell me, to the defacing of that perfect shape, in which at first thou broughtest me forth. O Lord, how many children and youth, haue beene maymed at nurse, and through the carelesnesse of those vnto whom they haue beene committed vnto trust, how many haue fallen into

                the continuall blessings which 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
haue receiued euery day &amp; night of this present life, and for thy liberality in giuing me such plenty of foode and rayment, not onely for my necessity, but for my plenteous and free liuing, not onely in health, but in sicknesse: And I thanke thee that thou hast giuen me such plenty, that I may be able to lend, and do good vnto others, and that thou hast made my Cup to ouerflowe, and hast giuen mee discretion to vse them soberly, thankfully, and honestly, and that thou hast giuen me a heart, to take my part of them, and kept mee from prodigall, vaine, and wastfull spending of them: so that my family haue not wanted in due season, that portion that hath bin fit for them to haue, and mee to giue them. O Lord I thank thee, that since I came to mans estate, thou hast kept me from vaine and idle courses of liuing, and that I haue not diminished thy blessings, but encreased them; for it

is thou, O Lord, that giuest meanes and power, not onely to keepe the patrimony of our Fathers, but to encrease it. Yea, it is thou that giuest power vnto our hands, to get goods, thou makest wise, thou makest simple, thou makest rich and poore, thou makest noble and ignoble, wee liue, moue, and haue our Being all in thee, and from thee, and what soeuer we are in this life, wee are at thy will and pleasure, and thine especiall appointment: for though we rise early, and goe to bed late, yet without thy blessing wee labour in vaine, and haue but paine and sorrow the reward of our desires. Wherefore (O Lord) I thanke thee againe and againe for thine vnspeakeable loue which thou hast manifested vnto mee, not onely in blessing mee with an honest vocation and meanes, in this world to liue, and maintaine my charge, at home and abroad, in honest profits and recreations,

whereby thou hast made my life pleasant, and comfortable vnto me: but aboue all, I thanke thee for thy mercy in Christ Iesus, wherewith thou louest mee both before, and since my being, and that thou hast so especially cared for my soule, while I knew thee not, neither cared for to know thee; for I was so dead and hardned in the custome of sinning, so that I could not, nor did care to call vpon thee, but followed the concupiscence of my owne carnall and fleshly desires, sauouring nothing, but that which did altogether offend and displease thee, hating thy word not onely in it selfe: but also the Ministers thereof, and professours thereof, because of it whom otherwise I should haue loued: vntill it pleased thee, by the power thereof, to illuminate my blinde vnderstanding, and made mee to see the wretchednesse wherein I lay, for want of thy grace. O Lord, such

was and is thy loue, that when with the sight of my wretchednesse, I began to dispaire, thou didst reueale thy Sonne vnto me, and promised mee, that though my sinnes were as red as scarlet, yet if I did beleeue in thy promises, confesse my sinnes and forsake them, they should bee forgiuen: which I did, and euer since through thy grace haue done, and will doe: hereby hast thou iustified mee, and sanctified me, and giuen me an assured hope of my glorification. And thus of the member of Sathan, hast thou made mee, of thine owne free adoption, a member of Christ.
            Wherefore (most louing Creatour) support mee, by the assistance of thy holy spirit, that I may stand fast, and perseuere in these Graces and gifts of grace, the seales of my adoption, vnto my liues end: And may abound in all fruits of righteousnesse, sanctification, and holinesse, vnto a perfect

man in Christ Iesus. This is that mercy of mercies, surpassing all others, which onely maketh mee happy, in whatsoeuer outward wants, or condition I shall be in this life, and though thou gauest mee all my desire, which this world can afford, yet without it I should still remaine most miserable, though in neuer so great an estate, or esteeme of the men of this world.
            Therefore for this blessing, whereby thou hast pleased to saue me by faith and repentance, I doe praise and thanke thee, not with the tongue and lippes onely, but with the whole man. Let all that is within mee praise, praise thee; O Lord, while I haue breath, I will praise thee, for thou onely art worthy to bee praised: yea, my soule praise thou the Lord: To thee most glorious Trinity, be giuen all possible praise, might, and maiestie, in heauen and in earth, by thine elect Angels, and

vs men, in our bodies and spirits for euermore,
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            This Meditation inciteth vs to repaire vnto God, in Prayers, in silent sighes, and in inward desires and groanes.
            
               O Father, full of knowledge deepe,
               thou searchest secrets of the heart,
               Behold'st desires wee priuate keepe,
               with hidden silence in the darke.
               But yet thou doest thus much require,
               thy children should knowe and confesse
               Thee for to be their light some fire,
               that iudg'st their workes in righteousnesse.
            
            
               As thou hast fram'd in man a heart,
               wherewith his Maker to beleeue:
               A tongue, and lips, and euery part,
               wherewith he glory may thee giue,
               And thou doest challenge at his hands,
               free sacrifice of thankes and praise:
               And honours due throughout all lands,
               that all men canst deiect and raise.
            
            
               
               Thy children must not in their minde
               be dumbe, nor in their tongues be mute:
               When they should seeke thine helpe to finde,
               and by petition shew their suite.
               Thy Sonne doth bid me aske and haue,
               and finde to seeke, to knocke, to enter:
               What they doe want, that they may craue,
               by faith in him they may aduenture.
            
            
               Thou still art ready to be found,
               and helpe thine owne in their distresse:
               That in their faith are constant found,
               and patient in their heauinesse.
               Therefore, deere Father, I beset,
               with many miseries distrest:
               Come vnto thee thine ayde to get,
               and after trouble to finde rest,
            
            
               And haue thy grace without, within:
               but I that am of sinners chiefe,
               Because thou hat'st in me my sinne,
               may doubt thou wilt not giue reliefe.
               Alas poore wretch, what shall I doe?
               to aske I am so farre vnfit,
               Vnapt my God to seeke vnto,
               vnworthy to haue benefit.
            
            
               
               Of what I craue or doe desire,
               and yet to cry I will not linne:
               Thy mercies great I will admire,
               and craue to cure my wofull sinne.
               O let thy spirit me sanctifie,
               vntye my tongue, open my lips:
               I cannot silence keepe, for why,
               my conscience euery houre me whips.
               My miseries growe more and more,
               within my bones I finde no rest;
               Thy grace anew to me restore,
               and let me speake what likes thee best.
            
            
               Let thine eares euer be enclinde,
               to my extreame and dolefull cries;
               Let me thy mercies ready finde,
               to take my teares from weeping eyes.
               Thou euermore doest heare the cries,
               of all that feare thy holy name.
               And comfort'st them with thy mercies,
               that trust in thee and begge the same.
               Their soules thou doest from death defend,
               and chear'st their hearts in time of neede:
               To me therefore thy comforts send,
               and giue thy helpe with louing speede.
            
            
               Thy seruants cannot hold their tongue,
               
                  
though oft they muse and cannot see.
               Why their afflictions last so long,
               and they for mercy cry to thee:
               Till at the length the fire of zeale,
               doth kindle then, it out must breake:
               Tongue cannot hold, but must reueale
               their groanes, &amp; griefes, &amp; needs must speake.
               To shew their hope which like to fire,
               none can suppresse when they beleeue.
               'Twill pierce the clouds, to thee aspire,
               yet thou doest seeme no helpe to giue.
            
            
               At last thy goodnesse doth appeare,
               and thou embracest him with ioy:
               Time of deliuerance draweth neere,
               and thou Lord freedst vs from annoy.
               Good God, how commeth this to passe,
               that I so long haue sought to thee,
               And thou still seem'dst to hide thy face,
               and keep'st thy graces still from me.
               How long haue I vnto thee pray'd,
               and thou seem'st not to giue me eare.
               This makes mine heart and thoughts afrai'd,
               ready to faint with deepe despaire
               I ready was for to surcease,
               the suit which I so long haue sought:
               
                  
Made vnto thee for to appease
               thy wrath by Christ that hath me bought.
            
            
               O Lord my God thy promises,
               and louing kindnesse onely feede:
               And comfort'st me in heauinesse,
               with neuer dying hope in neede.
               I know expected time will come,
               when thou for getting all my sinne,
               Wilt see my sorrowes all and some,
               and free the bondage I am in.
               Thou art my God, thy helpe is at hand,
               thou art a Father, thou know'st when
               To giue the State, doest vnderstand
               of richest Kings, and poorest men.
            
            
               The things most fit thou do'st be stowe,
               and helpest when all helpe is missing.
               Those could not creepe thou mak'st to goe,
               and powrest downe on them thy blessing.
               Therefore O God all sufficient,
               repleate with merey, full of loue,
               I doe not presse to know the intent,
               but pray thee doe what mercy moue.
            
            
               To say come now, or then, doe this,
               for the time, where, when, what, and how:
               
                  
What thou doest ayme, my marke may misse,
               me to thy prouidence I bowe.
               Yet be not ouer long away,
               for thou doest know my feeblenesse:
               Thou seest my troubles day by day,
               bow'd downe to extreame wretchednesse.
               Without hope of recouerie
               I fall: alas what shall I doe!
               There is no trust, but trust in thee,
               for helpe and ayde, and succour to.
               I know by proofe that thou art bent,
               to heare poore sinfull wretched men
               When they are truly penitent,
               and when they pray deliuer'st then.
            
            
               From troubles, strife, and all debate:
               from sicknesse, death, and deadly paine:
               From enuie, malice, sinne, and hate,
               the contrite heart thou'lt not disdaine:
               But who is righteous in thy sight,
               or in thy Judgements cleane are seene:
               Angels before thee are not bright,
               much lesse we wretches righteous beene:
               But all are sinners, all transgresse,
               our elder Fathers were impure:
               All haue offended more or lesse,
               yet was thy promise firme and sure.
            
            
               
               And did obtaine mercy and grace,
               reliefe, hope, strength, saluation:
               They sawe the brightnesse of thy face,
               thou gauest them consolation.
               Our Fathers, Lord, were comforted,
               strengthened, relieu'd, and blest
               Onely by grace, and iustified,
               as righteous men in Iesus Christ.
               Impute not sinne vnto my charge,
               not for my merit and desert.
               But for thy Sonne my soule enlarge,
               and giue to me a spotlesse heart.
            
            
               Thou Lord, full of compassion,
               and in thy mercies infinite,
               Beare with my imperfections,
               and let me in thy lawes delight:
               Couer my sinnes, as righteous take me,
               and righteous shall I euer be:
               That righteous am not, righteous make me,
               in Christ, O Lord, consider me.
               O Lord, what can it profit thee,
               me to for sake or leaue in thrall,
               As though thou didst disualue me,
               my daily cries, and offerings all.
            
            
               My troubles yet continue still,
               
                  
I seeke thee, and am yet denied:
               Of earthly blessings doe thy will,
               thy name be alwayes glorified.
               Wretch that I am what end shall be
               I still complaine, I sigh, and crie;
               I crie, and call, yet hear'st not me,
               I still will seeke thee till I die.
               Thou mayest be found be as thou wilt,
               into thy hands I me commend:
               Thou full of mercy, I of guilt,
               in faith and hope doe still attend.
            
         
         
            A Prayer for the worthy receiuing of the Lords Supper.
            OMost louing Sauiour, how great and wonderfull is thy loue to thy Church, that before thou didst leaue this world in thy humanity, didst not onely send vp loud cries and teares vnto thy Father (for them which did, and which after thy departure, should beleeue in thee) but didst also ordaine a perpetuall commemoration of thy death and passion,

through the institution of the Sacramentall signes of Bread and Wine, at the last Supper of the Passeouer, in the same night thou wast betrayed, charging, in thy Apostles, thy whole Church vnto the worlds end, to doe it in remembrance of thee, assuring vs that as often as wee did eate that bread, and drinke that wine, according to thy appointment, that thereby wee should shew thy death vntill thou didst come, and so keepe a perpetuall remembrance of thee, not onely in our hearts, but in our eyes, as if wee sawe thee crucified vpon the Crosse.
            O Lord, examining my selfe, of my faith, my repentance, and loue, I finde that my faith is weake, my repentance slacke and dull, and my loue colde, or but luke-warme; so that of my selfe (O most mercifull Lord) I durst not presume to come vnto thy table: but O Lord, for this I iudge

my selfe, that I may not be iudged of thee, the worst and vnworthiest of all those that come vnto thy table: For vnto this present, through the multitude of my sinnes, with which I am laden, I haue (like Iudas) done nothing but betrayed thee, and pricke thy head, and pierced thy side more cruelly, then the thorns or speare wherewith thou wast crowned and pearced, and so in as much as in mee lieth, I am guilty of the blood shedding, and death of my Lord.
            But (most heauenly Father) as the Israelites stung with the fiery Serpents, looked vnto the Serpent, Moses set vp: so, O Lord, smarting in soule with the anguish of my sinnes, by which I am continually guiltie of thy death, and so againe (like Iudas) worthy of eternall death, much more violently to be inflicted after the taking of the sop. Yet doe I looke vnto thy Crosse, on which

thou sufferest for me, humbly beseeching thee, for that obedience by which thou hast satisfied Gods wrath and iustice, to doe away my sinnes (as Dauids after his adultery and murther) that I may become a worthy partaker of the body &amp; blood of my Lord, and the Sacramentall Bread and Wine, after which I haue so earnestly thirsted, may not (like the Israelites Quailes, sticking in their teeth) become neither my bodily nor spirituall death, nor (like the vnworthy Corinthians) for my carelesse and negligent receiuing by the suddaine hand of sicknesse, be struck vnto death, but as the faithfull Iewes in their constant and conscionable celebration of their feast of Passeouer by them kept, a perpetuall remembrance of their Egyptian deliuerrnce from Pharaohs bondage, were exceedingly edified, &amp; confirmed in the promises of thy loue, that thou wouldest be their

God, and they should be thy people, which they sawe fulfilled in their Fathers, and still continued vnto themselues, through the hope of the Messiah, by whom they expected their greatest safety and deliuerance. Graunt vnto mee, O heauenly Father, that as the Minister of thy Word and Sacraments, setteth a part the Bread and Wine, so I may remember the eternall loue, by which in the beginning thou diddest set a part thy Sonne, through faith in him to be my saluation, promising that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue euerlasting life. And as I see the Wine powred out, and the Bread broken: so I may remember thy patient enduring the breaking of thy body, and shedding of thy blood, whereby thou hast payed the price, and satisfied the punishment that was due vnto me, and as the Bread &amp; Wine doe presently comfort and refresh

my body: so most sweet Sauiour, let me feele my soule so comforted and edified this day, and so often as I shall thinke of thee, and thy mercies hereby promised and assured; yea, graunt that being made one with thee by spirituall vnion, I may liue in thee, and thou in me, in the encrease of a godly life, to the honour of thee my Sauiour. To whom with the Father and the holy Ghost, be giuen by me and all thine, both present and eternall praise.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            Another godly Meditation before the receiuing of the holy Communion.
            O Almighty God and mercifull Father, I am a secret sinner, and my heart is a bottomlesse pit of all corruptions: wilfully and foolishly; ignorantly and obstinately haue I sinned against thee, vnto whose eye all the secrets

of my soule lye open, but now I come vnto thee as the sick man vnto the Physitian, as an vncleane man vnto the Well of mercy and grace, offered in the pretious blood-shedding of Iesus Christ, and represented to my soule in this blessed Sacrament. Haue mercy vpon mee (O Lord) haue mercy vpon mee, and forgiue mee all the euills that I am guilty of. Giue mee grace that I may discerne the Lords body, and so receiue it in this Sacrament, with such chastity of body, humblenesse of minde, thankfulnesse of soule, hearty contrition, dread and reuerence, as is meete for such a mysterie.
            O Lord Iesus, it is truly said of thee, that thou didst receiue sinners, and eate with them, and I verily beleeue that thou art the same still, full of goodnesse and mercy: wherefore I beseech thee leaue me not to my selfe, reiect me not from thy Table, come

into my heart, and purge me from all filthinesse of the flesh and of the spirit. Enter into my soule, seale and sanctifie me, both within and without.
            Inflame me with loue and charity towards all men, to forgiue and forget: to doe good, to pray for them, that I may follow the steps of my blessed Sauiour. Open the eyes of my vnderstanding, and helpe mee to examine my selfe, concerning my knowledge, faith, and repentance. Send mee the hunger and thirst after this righteousnesse: satisfie me with this heauenly foode, make mee verily partaker of all the benefits of his Passion. Oh deare Lord Iesus, since thou hast suffered so many things for my sake, and hast commanded mee not to dispaire, nor distrust thy goodnesse, graunt me grace to eate of this bread, and to drinke of this Cup worthily, that I may continually remaine in thy grace and fauour. O Lord God

the Father, giue mee the full consolation of this mysterie and commemoration, that my faith may be encreased, my hope confirmed, my charity enflamed, my weake conscience comforted, all dangers repelled, and my soule assured of her saluation in the blood of Christ, let no profanenesse enter into my heart, so long as I am about this holy action; but giue mee grace to receiue with purity of heart, and cleanenesse of soule, with loue, dread, and stedfast faith; haue mercy vpon me good Lord, that by vnworthy receiuing, I be not guilty of his pretious body and blood, who came downe from heauen, liued with men, and swamme through a red sea of blood in his agony and passion to bee my Redeemer. Haue mercy vpon the whole Church, and to this purpose, haue mercy vpon this place, and this companie, that they may serue and please thee in this holy seruice,

and all other actions of their life. O Lord, be not angry with mee a barren and dry tree, a creature with a face of brasse, and heart of flint: I haue not so many teares as are sufficient to wash thy feete with Mary Magdalen: but thou hast shed as much of thine owne blood, as surficeth to wash away all the sinnes of mee, and all the world: then be not angry with mee, O Lord: but let thy grace supply my wants: let thy mercy pardon my sinnes: let thy holy spirit prepare my soule, thy merits enrich my pouerty, and thy most pretious blood wash away all the spots of my life, that I may worthily receiue this heauenly Sacrament: so that I may bee strengthened thereby, &amp; throughly filled with the heauenly foode of thy body and blood: for the mortification of the old man, the confirmation of my faith, and the finall saluation of my soule. O Lord heare my prayers, &amp; graunt

my requests I beseech thee.
            Amen.
         
         
            Godly Meditations vpon the loue and mercy of God in bestowing (together with his Sonne) these holy Mysteries vpon vs: the commemoration whereof may moue vs to an awefull reuerence in the participation of the same.
            O Father of mercy, and God of all consolation, seeing all creatures doe confesse thee to bee their Gouernour and Lord, it becommeth vs the workmanship of thine owne hands, to reuerence and magnifie thy godly Maiestie. First for that thou hast created vs to thine owne image and similitude: but chiefely because thou 
                  •
               ast deliuered vs from that euerlasting death and damnation, into which Sathan drew mankinde by the meanes of sinne, from the 
                  •
               ondage whereof, neither man,

nor Angell, was able to make vs free. But thou, O Lord, rich in mercy, and infinite in goodnesse, hast prouided our redemption to stand in thine onely and welbeleued Sonne, whom of very loue thou didst giue to bee made man (perfect in all things, freely exempted and excepted from sinne) that in his body he might receiue the punishment of our transgression, by his death to make satisfaction to thy Iustice, and by his resurrection, to destroy him that was the Author of death, and so bring againe life vnto the world from which the whole off-spring of Adam was most iustly exiled.
            O Lord, we acknowledge that no creature was able to comprehend the length and breadth, the deepenesse and height, of that thy most excellent loue, which moued thee to shew mercy where none was deserued: to promise and giue life, where death had gotten victory: to receiue vs into

thy grace when wee could doe not hing but rebell against thy maiestie. O Lord, the blinde dulnesse of our corrupt nature, will not suffer vs sufficiently to weigh these thy most ample benefits: Yet neuerthelesse, at the commandement of Iesus Christ our Lord, wee present our selues to this his Table, which hee hath left to be vsed in remembrance of his death, vntill his comming againe, to declare and witnesse before the world, that by him alone we haue receiued liberty and life: 
                  •
               hat by him alone thou doest acknowledge vs to be thy children and heires: that by him alone we haue entrance to the Throne of thy grace; that by him alone wee are possessed in our spirituall Kingdome, to eate and drinke at his Table, with whom wee haue our conuersation presently in heauen, and by whom our bodies shall be raised vp ag
                  •
               ine from the dust, and shall be placed with him

in that endlesse ioy, which thou O Father of mercy hast prepared for thine Elect, before the foundation of the world was layd.
            And these most inestimable benefits wee acknowledge and confesse to haue receiued of thy free mercy and grace, by thine onely beloued Sonne Iesus Christ: for th
                  •
                which we therefore thy congregation, mooued by thy holy Spirit, render vnto thee all thanks, praise, and glory for euer.
            What tongue, or what heart, can worthily giue thee thankes, O Lord Iesu, for thine vnspeake
                  •
                able loue towards vs? who to th
                  ••
                intent to redeeme mankinde forl
                  •
               rne, didst vouchsafe to become man, and to take all the miseries of our estates vpon thee, insomuch that in the end, thou being a pure and vnspotted Lambe, wast contented to bee made a sacrifice for vs vpon the Altar of the Crosse, and to abide the punishment due for our sinnes, that thou

mightest reconcile vs to thy Father, yea and both in life and death thou didst spend, giue, and bestow thy selfe wholy vpon vs, and for vs. And thy gracious goodnesse was not so contented, but also lest we might at any time perchance forget so great a benefit, or at least our trust in thee might at any time quaile, euen now raigning in heauen, thou refreshest our soules from time to time with the foode of thy body, and chearest them vp with the holy Cup of thy blood.
            Wherefore I beseech thee, let thy spirit cleanse my heart, that I may not come vnworthily to that heauenly feast, and to the table, whereat euen the very Angels doe tremble: but that by thy shedding thy selfe into my b
                  •
               
               wels, I may growe manly in thee, and become the liuelier by spirituall encreasements, so as I may continue vnto the end, in the blessed fellowship of thy mysticall

body, whom it is thy will to haue all one with thee, in such wise as thou art all one with the Father, by the knitting of the holy Ghost, to whom be praise and thanks for euermore. Amen.
            
            I yeeld thee hearty thankes, O Lord Iesus Christ, for thine vnutterable loue, in vouchsafing to redeeme mankinde by thine own death: And I beseech thee suffer not thy most holy blood to haue beene shed in vaine for mee, but that I growing vp in thee by continuall encrease of heauenly strength, may become a fit member of thy mysticall body, which is the Church, and neuer swarne from that most holy couenant, which thou madest with thy chosen Disciples in thy last Supper, by distributing the bread vnto them, and by reaching them the Cup: and by them to all those that by a liuely faith apprehend the merits of thy most pretious death and passion.
            
               
My Lord Iesus Christ, what am I that thou shouldest vouchsafe to come vnder my roofe? Can a sinfull man deserue such grace? O Lord my God, I am certainly altogether vnworthy. Am I better then all my Fathers were, thou wouldest not shew thy selfe to Moses one twinkling of an eye, and how happeneth it that thou humblest thy selfe so much, as to come to a man that is both a Publican and a sinner? And thou vouchsafest not onely to eate with him, but also to giue thy selfe to be eaten of him.
            Haile O bread of life, which cammest downe from heauen, and which giuest life to as many as receiue thee worthily. Surely whosoeuer receiueth thee w
                  •
               rthily, although his soule be seuered from his body by temporall death, yet shal he not die for euer, because that the separation is not a death, but a passing from death to life: by reason whereof, hee that

eateth thee worthyly, beginneth to liue with thee for euer when he dieth in this world: thou art the bread of the Angels: the very sight of thee doth solace and glorifie the Angels: thou art the food of the soule, the glory of heauen, the solace of all Angels &amp; Saints. (O most holy food) by the eating whereof by a liuely faith, is set free from all euill, is filled with all goodnesse, and is vndoubtedly made immortall, O sacred foode of our pilgrimage, by the strength whereof wee passe out of this naughty world, to the glorious company in heauen. Goe on therfore, O beleeuing and faithfull soule, be merry, and reioyce in God thy Sauiour: take thy fill of this feast wherein the body of thy Sauiour is set before thee to feede on: man fell from God by eating the fruit of the forbidden tree, but by this foode hee is redeemed againe to endlesse glory.

               O Lord how doe my woes encrease,
               how many are my miseries:
               My troubles rise and neuer cease,
               men iudge thou wilt not heare my cries:
               They say thou wilt me quite forsake,
               that there's no helpe for me in thee:
               But (Lord) they are but such that make
               their censure with a carnall eye.
               And doe not spiritually discerne,
               thy secret purpose and intents:
               Correcting them whom thou wouldst learne,
               to know thy Law and Commandements.
               Chastising them whom thou do'st loue,
               and scourging them oft with thy rod:
               That thou their hearts and mindes may'st moue,
               to feare and serue thee mighty God.
            
            
               The wicked outward meanes preferre,
               and worldly helpes at neede they muster:
               
                  
And not to God themselues referre,

               Who workes by meanes his sacred will,
               and without meanes brings to effect:
               And against meanes can saue or kill
               for those him serue, his true Elect:

               I will hold fast by God aboue,
               whose promise iust and true I finde:
               I striue thy statutes Lord to keepe,
               what thou command'st I will performe.
               Direct me right to thee I creepe,

               with nets and ginnes ere I beware;
               And scoffe me basely with reproach,
               with shamefull scandalls and disgrace.
               With thy protection Lord approach,
               and let thy mercy me embrace.
               Let not me come within the reach,

               Whose facts are foule, they faire in speech,

               to worke the euill they conspire.
            
            
               O let me tread in the right path,
               and walke from faith to faith in loue.
               Obserue thy lawes, and shunne thy wrath,
               and forward to all vertue mone.
               And let my conscience witnesse beare,
               of my saith and integrity:
               Let all men see the Christall cleare,
               of my poore hearts sincerity.
               Though I good Father, cannot liue
               free from all sinne, and all offence:
               And some take cause, though I none giue,
               yet keepe thou cleare my conscience.
               Shall I deserue still as I doe
               mens iust reproofes, through indiscretion:
               And that against my meaning too,

               That breake forth into bitternesse,
               against me that am weake and lame:
               And vomite out their filthinesse.
               What thou hast done, they count my shame.
            
            
               And take it as an argument,
               
                  
that I am in deiection:
               And thinke it is thy full intent,
               to keepe me from protection.

of life, am weakened in beliefe:
               Our Fathers pray'd with trust in thee
               in dangers, out of troubles all
               Being deliuered and set free,
               and were rais'd vp when they did fall:
               Thou hearest them when they thee sought,
               and didst them lend thy ayding hands:
               When they almost to death were brought,
               and them deliuered out of bands.
            
            
               Great was thy fauour, Lord, to all
               them that tooke hold on thee by faith:
               But what am I that am so small,
               a worme, no man, as Dauid saith.
               Yet I beleeue, helpe vnbeliefe;
               Lord I am couered with shame.
               Be thou my glory, ease my griefe,
               that I may magnifie thy name.
               The wicked worldlings me contemne,
               because thou hid'st thy face from me
               Deriding grace, and me condemne
               because of imbecility.
               My neighbours that should me assist
               disdaine me: my familiars all
               That should me comfort, doe desist
               their helpe to raise me from my fall.
            
            
               
               They say of me my hopes are vaine,
               my kinsfolkes who should yeeld me ayde,
               In my necessities refraine,
               to come to me they are afraide:
               And tauntingly they scoffe and say,
               deseruedly he thus doth suffer:
               Is iust, he wrought his owne decay,
               none other kindnesse they me offer:
               I know 'tis thou that sitt'st on hie,
               doest send and suffer maladies:
               And therefore I on thee relie,
               to remedie my miseries.
               My woes, O Lord, by such encrease,
               as should in friendly wise relieue me:
               They that should seeke to make my peace,
               they are the men that most doe gritue me.
            
            
               But I that taste the Cup, will say
               'tis thou hast don't, and I will beare it:
               When 'tis thy will, who can say nay:
               'tis out of loue, why should I feare it:
               Relieue my soule with timely dewe,
               and comfort me restore.
               Restore my soule vnto those ioyes,
               the which I felt to fore.
               Now after stormes Lord send a calme,
               and graunt me peace yet now at last.
               
                  
And I will praise thee with a Psalme,
               with thankes for all thy fauour past.
               Ile magnifie thy name for aye,
               that bring'st such wonderous things to passe:
               That worldlings neither thinke nor say
               nor know why 'tis, or how it was.
            
            
               The iust shall heare, and Saints be glad,
               when wicked men shall faint and quaile,
               To see what fauour I haue had,
               and all their hope doth quench and quaile:
               Whom they so long haue scorn'd and deem'd,
               euen through afflictions cast away
               For thy name sake, Lord me esteem'd,
               their night is past, they haue their day.
               Respect my meditation,
               helpe me in time conuenient:
               Lord graunt my supplication,
               thou know'st and tri'st my hearts intent.
               Let not the righteous be dismaide,
               nor wicked triumph in my fall:
               Nor yet let sinners be afraide,
               in time of neede to thee to call.
               And let me put my confidence,
               direct my faith, erect my hope
               Vnto thy gracious prouidence,
               this of my prayers is the scope.
            
         
         
            
            A Prayer for the calling of the Iewes, and the continuall encrease of Christs Kingdome among all Nations.
            ALmighty &amp; euerliuing God, who after the floud, didst preserue Noah, and our Fathers, Sem, Iapheth, Terah, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, from the perishing waters, and from the continued deluge of sinne, which remained in the families of Ham and Canan, his wicked posterity: and of thy abundant mercies, pittied the blind ignorance, in which they had plunged themselues through Idolatrous superstition, and didst seperate our Father Abraham, and made of him a peculiar people, a royall Nation, and chosen generation, that for euermore should serue thee. And that they might neuer forget thy great goodnesse, it pleased thee to bring them into Egypt, that after

the fauour of Pharaoh was expired, they should suffer hard and cruell bondage the space of foure hundred yeeres, and then in the power of God, with a mighty hand and out-stretched arme, in the sight of King Pharaoh, thou wouldest bring them to their Fathers promised inheritance, through the red Sea, and waste Wildernesse, to the mount Syon, the hill of God, where thou diddest appeare vnto them in a glorious manner, to renue and continue the couenant made vnto their Father Abraham, that thou wouldest be their God, and the God of their seede for euermore. Wherefore thou diddest out of the midst of the flames of fire so speake vnto them, that they might liue, and know that thou louedst them, as thou hadst done their Fathers, that first came into Egypt, that thou wert the same Lord, and that there was no other God besides thee, in heauen or in

earth. Yet for all this great loue, of which the like was neuer heard, thou didst onely require them to keepe thy statutes, thy lawes, and thy commandements, promising it should goe well with them for euermore: but they started aside like a broken bowe, and cast thy promises, and law behind their backes, and forsooke thee the guide of their youth, and in their olde age, euen when they were growne fat, and full fed, with the abundance of thy blessings, they still spurned &amp; kicked against thee, and though thou didst early and late (in the time of the Iudges and Kings which they so much desired) send them Prophets: yet they cast thee off, and forgot the Lord that made them, and serued other gods of the Heathen, whom their Fathers neuer knew. Yet at last when they had killed thy Prophets and stoned thy seruants, thou in infinite loue, sent thy Sonne, saying,

that they would honour him. But O Lord, how much more cruelly did they behaue themselues towards thee, calling thee a sinner, and friend of Publicans and sinners, and the Prince of the deuils, and would haue throwne thee the Lord of life (as Sathan did the Heard of Swine) from the Rock into the Sea. And at last, when nothing tooke effect, according to their malicious minds, they came out against thee, as against a malefactour with clubbs, and staues, and tooke thee, and carried their expected Messiah, before Herod and Pontius Pilate, and brought false witnesse against thee, and preferred a murtherer before thee, and though indeede thou wert their King, yet in mockage they put vpon thee a purple roabe, and in thy hand a Scepter of reede, &amp; on thy head a crowne of thornes, then buffetted they thee, and spet vpon thy face, contemning both thy princely, priestly,

and propheticall offices, in which thou wast their perfect Sauiour. Then disroabed they thee, and carried thee without the gates of the Citie, and after an ignominious manner, with two theeues, vnto Golgotha the place of common execution, and nayled thee to a woodden Crosse in the middest of them. And after they had wounded thee in sundry places, yet againe in their malicious and cowardly fury, they pierced thy side with a speare, euen when thou sighedst, groanedst, prayedst vnto thy Father to forgiue them their sinnes, and to accept thy sacrifice. Yea, all this while they mocked thee, and bid thee come downe from the Crosse, to saue thy life as thou sauest others: and wrote a title ouer thy head vnto all Nations in contempt of thee; and when in the pangues of thy passion thou didst thirst for their pardon, then they ranne and flapped in thy mouth (not to comfort

thee, but to prolong thy sorrowes) an hysope spunge dipt in vinegar: and after thy death (to make them sport) they cast lots for thy garments. O sweet Sauiour, being thus abused by thy once peculiar people, thou hast most righteously, according to their wish, brought vpon them and their children, the reward of thy innocent blood, and done iustly in forsaking the house of thine honour, and put it into the possession of the Gentiles, to bee battered downe, that there might not bee left one stone vpon another, and to scatter them into perpetuall captiuity, as at this day we doe behold.
            But O heauenly Father, thou hast made knowne vnto vs Gentiles, that beleeue in thee according to thy Word, that they did no more, then what they hand and counsell had determined long before to be done. And had they knowne that they had crucified

thy Sonne, the Lord of glory, no doubt they would not haue done it, for in ignorance (as did their Fathers, they haue done it) wherfore, O God, for the respect thou bearest to Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, and for thy seruant Dauids sake, as thou hast promised (that a remnant should be saued) euen as many as thou wilt call, and the first fruits being holy, the branches descending thereof should be holy, haue respect vnto them, that with the fulnesse of vs Gentiles, they may come againe into the folde of Christ. O Lord our Sauiour, open their eyes, that they may beleeue the Scriptures, and so come againe, and be grafted into their owne Oliue stocke, for thou, O God, art able to graffe them in againe, for thy gifts and calling are without repentance. Wherefore take from them their vnbeliefe, that wee both Iewes &amp; Gentiles may be saued through thy mercy. O sweet Sauiour,

haue mercy on them, &amp; call them home againe, that wee and they may make one sheepe-fold, and like good sheep, know thy voice, and follow thee our louing Shepheard, in the sincere obedience of thy Gospell. Heauenly Father, blesse thy Church vniuersall, that it may stand fast in the obedience and faith of Christ: giue thy Gospell a free passage in it, &amp; among all people, that yet know not thee.
            O thou which art the Lord of the haruest, send forth diligent and painefull labourers into thy haruest. Blesse all the reformed Churches in these westerne parts, but especially this church of England, that it bee an ensample of sound doctrine, and godly life, vnto all other Churches. And graunt that the Kings, Nobles, and Senators, may remaine, and succeede nursing Fathers in it for euermore. O Lord, let not the wilde Boares of the Forrest, the Turke, nor Antichrist, supplant the faith

established among vs, nor roote vp the vine, that thine own right hand hath planted, but continue the light among vs which now liue, or hereafter shall liue, euen as long as the Sun or the Moone shall endure.
            O God, as thou hast promised for thy Elect sake, finish these dayes of sinne, and hasten thy comming vnto glory. And as by all thy workes in generall, so by vs men in speciall, yea by me with the residue of thy holy Church be especially giuen, both now, and for euermore, all honour and glory world without end.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            A Prayer for the discouerie and desolation of Antichrist.
            O God of Hoasts, the omnipotent, inuisible, and incomprehensible, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, the eternall

Creator, and most mighty vpholder of all things in heauen, and in earth, and by whom Kings ruie, and Princes raigne, heare me a poore sinfull subiect of thy great dominions, grieued and distressed in soule, to behold how the enemies of thy trueth doe bandy themselues against thee, and thy Christ, the Annoynted of the Lord, and the only King of Kings, the wonderfull Counsellour, the mighty God, the euerlasting Father, the Prince of peace. Looke downe, and discouer the haters of thy Word, those that haue cast thy lawes behinde their backes, and scorne to be ruled by the sincere trueth of the same: yet shame not to take thy lawes in their mouthes, though they hate to be reformed thereby. O God we haue heard with our eares, and our Fathers haue tolde vs, that in the last dayes shall bee perilous times, in which men shall be louers of themselues, couetous,

proud, boasters, blasphemers, disobedient vnto superiours, vnthankfull, vnholy, without naturall affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good; traytours, heady, high minded, louers of pleasure more then of thee, hauing a forme of godlinesse (a great shew of righteousnesse) wanting the power thereof, being in trueth, nothing but scoffers, and walkers after their lust: forbidding meates, drinkes, &amp; marriages, which with thanksgiuing thou hast made holy and honourable, being indeede giuen to adulterie, fornication, lasciniousnesse, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, strifes, wrath, seditions, heresies, murthers, drunkennesse, reuilings, and infinite the like, whereby it is come to passe, that there is none righteous no not one, none that vnderstandeth, none that seeketh after GOD aright, but haue

stumbled at noone-day, euen against that rocke of life, &amp; thereby haue vsed their tongues to deceit, and opened their mouthes full of cursing and bitternesse, and haue runne as Caine with their feete to shed innocent blood, yea most watchfull to shed the blood of the righteous: destruction and misery are in their wayes, and the way of peace they doe not know. For the feare of God is not before their eyes, euery one deuiseth to worke mischiefe, putting farre away the euill day, professing themselues wise, till they became fooles. O Lord, thou hast iustly done to the men of this world, in these our dayes, as vnto the ancient Philosophers, who mightily boasted themselues of their wisedome &amp; generall knowledge, and yet were ignorant of thee, euen as the Antichristian enemies doe at this day boast themselues to be the onely true Church. Yet because they knew thee in word and

not in deede; therefore thou gauest them vp, vnto their owne hearts lusts, to worship and serue the creature in steed of the Creator, adoring the bread in the Sacrament for Christ himselfe, and honouring the Pope a mere man, as God himselfe, saying hee is God, euen as the heathen Gentiles vnto their wooden Gods sometime said: thus, O Lord, because the Antichristian enemies haue agreed with the heathen to contemne thy Word; thou hast iustly done to giue them vp vnto a reprobate minde, to worke all manuer of vnrighteousnesse, as at this day wee see, the Romish Bishop, Prelates, Clergie, and Professours to be, the man and men of sinne that should sit in the Temple of God, and in doctrine speake blasphemies and wicked vntrueths. O God, in thy Word thou hast euidently marked him out, shewing that hee should pretend chastity in heart and body,

but indeede haue nothing lesse: to claime all spirituall power, to open and shut the gates of thy Kingdome at his owne will and pleasure, and against whom hee lust, to bee vniuersall Bishop through the whole world, and supreame head of the Church, and Kings and Princes to be his vassalls, and at his making and deposing. O Lord, hee thrusteth out of the Church as heretickes all that speake against his blasphemies, denouncing damnation to all that will not beleeue his exposition of thy Word, saying, that hee hath alwayes the holy Ghost in his breast, and that hee cannot erre. He hath forbidden the publique reading of thy Word, as hereticall and dangerous, especially for simple people, and ordained thy seruice in an vnknowne tongue, that the people might offer vnto thee the Sacrifice of fools: &amp; in stead of the Sacrament, which wee should often receiue,

he hath brought into the Church a superstitious sacrifice of the Masse, in which they pretend to offer thee (O Christ) againe for the sinnes of the people, and the Priests eating is sufficient for all the rest of the Church, be they neuer so many; or if they receiue it in one kinde, it is enough for them, saying, that the body is no

                without the blood, quite gaine, saying thy commandements, drink yee all of this. Hee teacheth for sound Doctrine, that wee must be cleansed in Purgatory, in which he can giue indulgence to release whom he will, and that wee are saued by our good workes; that wee may keepe perfectly all the commandements, and so deserue our saluations by our owne merites, and that in Prayer we should call on the virgin Mary, as Queen of heauen, to command her Sonne to heare vs: teaching vs, that she is our Aduocate, that pleadeth for vs. He teacheth Pilgrimages,

worshipping Images, keeping Reliques, and that euery man hath

               Wherein the distressed prayeth for faith zeale, and strength, in vndergoing Gods corrections.
            
            
               O Lord, I lift, my heart to thee,
               my soule in thee doth euer trust:
               O let me not confounded be,
               but make me righteous with the iust:
               
                  
Let men not haue their wills' gainst me,
               but powre on me thy comforts sweet.
               Thy sauing health Lord let me see,
               who prostrate begge it at thy feete.
               Let thy right hand and prouidence,
               be stretched out to hold me vp.
               And giue me grace and patience,
               in lowlinesse to taste thy cup:
               So shall I sit on surest rocke,
               and strength and power to me get,
               And stoutly shield mine enemies stroke,
               though round about they me beset.
            
            
               For why, my comfort is in thee,
               and on thy prouidence I depend,
               O keepe me safe in liberty,
               till all my troubles come to end:
               From perils sixe hast me deliuered,
               I know therefore thou wilt from seauen,
               From earthly thoughts let me be seuer'd,
               and conuersation haue in heauen.
               I know that loue a multitude
               of shamefull sinnes doth closely couer:
               Within the gates I me include,
               thou art my soules true spouse and louer.
               The faithfull thereby may take hold,
               of hope to haue a prosperous end:
               
                  
Of their desires this makes me bold,
               for ayde and comfort to attend.
            
            
               And with all patience to perseuer,
               I know thy word it is most sure:
               Poore penitent by faith, I le euer
               stand firme, and to the end endure.
               Alas, deere God, I nothing crane,
               to haue of thee by mine owne right:
               But in Christs name Ile aske and haue,
               for he is most gracious in thy sight.
               Yea for his merits thou do'st loue me,
               in him I know thou art well pleas'd.
               And hearest sinners when they moue thee:
               for giu'st their sinne, and they are eas'd.
               Amongst whom, Lord, I am the chiefe,
               and of good things am ignorant:
               Yet on the Crosse didst saue the Thiefe,
               for Christ his sake me mercy graunt,
            
            
               In this world vanities most vilde,
               I liue and haue no taste of truth:
               I knew not I was in exile,
               but did in folly spend my youth.
               Of thee alone I knowledge haue,
               (for of my selfe I am but weake)
               Thou art my God that strength me gaue,
               
                  
to worke, to rest, to liue, to speake.
               For of my selfe is miserie,
               and of my selfe is all that's ill:
               But from thee Lord comes all mercie,
               and perfect power to worke thy will
               Within, to consolation,
               of my sad soule and wounded heart
               Without, to preseruation
               of my weake body in each part.
            
            
               Therefore teach me the truth, O Lord,
               (O sacred truth) teach me thy wayes
               That I should walke, led by thy Word,
               and to thy glory spend my dayes:
               Lord keepe from wicked thoughts mine heart,
               mine hands that they commit none ill:
               Mine eyes, my tongue, and euery part,
               Lord graunt they may performe thy will:
               My feete from falling still preserue,
               as of my selfe regard me not.
               Deale not with me as I deserue,
               as are my sinnes reward me not.
               Behold not my deformities,
               but looke on me in Christ by loue,
               My sinnes and all enormities,
               as mists and cloudes from me remoue.
            
            
               
               Thou righteous art and gracious,
               reformest sinners, sinnes forgiu'st:
               O be to me propitious,
               to liue in thee that euer liu'st.
               Keepe thou my soule, let me not perish,
               nor vtterly to be confounded
               That trust in thee, but my soule cherish:
               and ioy mine heart which thou hast wounded.
               Thou art my strength and sure defence,
               in time of dangers imminent,
               Though all helpe faile, experience
               hath taught me, thou art permanent.
               I goe vnto thine Oracle,
               and from thy word I counsaile take,
               And finde a wonderous miracle,
               thou neuer do'st thine owne forsake.
            
            
               Thy seruants that in thee doe trust,
               thy Tabernacle shall them shield:
               In secret thou do'st hide the iust,
               that are not with foule sinne defilde.
               Hearken, O Lord, hearken and heare,
               vnto my voyce that call and crie:
               O let thy loue towards me appeare,
               with streames and floods of thy mercie.
               Thou sayest, O Lord, seeke yee my face,
               what is it? but in my distresse,
               
                  
To crie for helpe, and craue thy grace,
               and ayde in time of heauinesse:
               My soule by the pure priuiledge
               of thy free spirit which teacheth trueth,
               My heart prepared with knowledge
               and faith, and hope vnto thee sueth.
            
            
               My tongue doth speake, mine heart doth mutter,
               and euery member in his place,
               Doth striue to speake, and these words vtter,
               helpe me opprest: hide not thy face.
               Though father that did me beget,
               my mother that from wombe me bare,
               And all my friends forsake me yet,
               thou Lord of me tak'st charge and care.
               O Lord thou wilt me not forsake,
               for so hast promis'd in thy Word:
               In all distresse no feare Ile take,
               but forthwith flie to thee O Lord,
               Thou giu'st not like our earthly Sires,
               nor wants suppliest like carnall friends.
               That would but cannot our desires,
               performe in deedes as heart pretends.
            
            
               Hopelesse I should downe faint, and fall,
               did I not in thee surely trust:
               That holdeth no respect at all,
               
                  
but vnto those whom Christ makes iust.
               And thou acceptest not vaine glory
               as worldlings doe, nor things externall:
               Thou look'st not to things transitorie,
               but to the things that are internall.
               A lowly and obedient heart,
               a trembling spirit thou doest elect:
               Of poore opprest thou tookst the part,
               and proud men downe thou doest deiect:
               Frame thou therefore my inward zeale,
               that outward businesse me deceiue not
               Of comforts which thou doest reueale
               to thine, and me of ioyes bereaue not.
            
            
               When at thy mercy gate I knocke,
               doe not as rich men vse the poore,
               That 'gainst them faest the gates doe locke,
               but quickly Lord set ope the dore:
               Let not my miseries depriue
               my heart of ioy, or soules comfort:
               Let not vaine things ill men deuise,
               draw me to be of their consort.
               Make strong my faith, and hope Lord giue me,
               and Ile take hold of thy protection.
               Be my defence and Pa
                     •…
                  oplie,
               and guide me safe to thy election.
               Thou hast, O Lord, my troubles scene,
               
                  
hast knowne my soule in bitternesse.
               Thou hast mine helpe and succour been,
               O helpe me now in my distresse.
            
            
               In mercies thou hast mightily.
               sau'd me from perils infinite:
               My life consumes, my heart doth die,
               my yeares doe waste, my day is night:
               The day tells day, the night the morrow,
               the base reproach of my disaster:
               Yea friends and foes adde griefe to sorrow,
               and each base mate doth me o're-master.
               I am now at the point to pine,
               O let it be thy blessed pleasure:
               To ease my griefe for I am thine,
               my paines asswage Lord in some measure;
               For thou my paines hast measured,
               and all that's good for those that feare,
               Lord thou in store hast treasured,
               to me Lord, let the same appeare.
               In sight of those that are my foes,
               that thinke there is no period:
               Of all my tortures, paine, and woes,
               graunt this for Christ his sake, O God.
            
         
         
            
            A Prayer of an afflicted minde.
            O Lambe of GOD which takest away the sinnes of the world, haue mercy vpon mee, a most vile and wretched sinner, wounded euen vnto death eternall; if thou Lord in whom all fulnesse of mercy and compassion doth dwell, doe not relieue and comfort mee. O Lord how am I assaulted by the crafty and subtill temptations of Sathan, that cunning serpent, that seeth all my weaknesses, both of soule and body, and neuer ceaseth night nor day, sleeping, waking, eating, drinking, hearing, and reading, mourning and laughing, but alwayes followeth &amp; doggeth me, with fearefull temptations, telling mee that I am but an hypocrite, and that all my repentance hath beene but in words, and not in heart, in outward shew, but not

in trueth: and that my sinnes are greater then God can or will forgiue, that I am none of his Elect, that I haue no true faith, saying, That those that truely beleeue, neuer doubt, that I doe not vnderstand Gods word aright, and that it doth nothing appertaine vnto mee, no more than vnto Iudas (who for all hee was an Apostle) yet was reprobated and cast away; and how knowest thou, but that thy faith is presumption, seeing neuer any man but St. Paul, had such assurance of faith. Yea, thou doest not delight in Gods word, nor so loue his Ministers as thou shouldest, thou doest not abound in good workes, all thy righteousnes is pharisaicall, thou art a louer of the world more then of God: doest thou not see how thou art continually punished, plagued, and smitten of God, neuer without one crosse or other, on thy selfe, thy wife, children, and seruants: on thy cattell,

goods, and aduentures, at home and abroad, and in other businesses: Yea, in euery thing thou puttest thine hand vnto, thou seest how God is against thee, and cannot abide thee: yea, euen in thy Prayers thou mayest feele how the spirit of God hath left thee: therefore deceiue not thy selfe, thou art none of his; if it were otherwise, thou shouldest not be so afflicted in euery thing as thou art. Deceiue not thy selfe, God doth not loue thee, if he did, hee would neuer haue suffered thee to commit so many sinnes, as thou hast done, by lying, by swearing, by drunkennesse, by whoring, by fornication, by adulterie, by murther, and the like, and to haue liued so long in them as thou hast done: Yea, what a prophaner of the Sabbath day hast thou beene? what filthy &amp; vncleane thoughts, what scurrilous Songs, and vnsauourie speeches haue issued out of thy heart and mouth, and how

hast thou beene swallowed vp in pleasure and pride, all the dayes of thy youth. And how many of Gods good creatures hast thou prophaned in thy belly, on thy backe, on thy neck, to pranke thy Iezabels face, thinking nothing good enough, and fine enough to pamper thy earthly carcasse: And doest thou thinke that God will now in thine olde age, accept thy blinde seruice. Thy repentance comes too late, God will not regard thy sacrifice, but as thou regardest not him, when hee called in thy youth; so now he will not regard thee in thine olde age, though thou make many cries vnto him; yea, there is no sacrifice can cleanse thee from thy sinnes, thou hast cast Gods law behinde thy backe, and committed the sinne against the holy Ghost, so that it is in vaine for thee to hope for mercy, thou canst not be forgiuen, though with Esau thou sh
                  •
               d neuer so many teares. Thou

art a reprobate by Gods decree, and what knowest thou, but that thou art in hell already, so that do what thou wilt, thou canst not be saued. And therefore drowne, or hang thy selfe, or cut thy throat: O Coward, kill thy selfe, and so shalt thou rid thy selfe out of this present paine.
            O heauenly Father, look down vpon this my wounded spirit: and (O Lord) driue away Sathan, that he preuaile not in these temptations against my soule. O Lord, so strong and violent are his temptations, that I know not how to resist them, but by the strength of thy holy Spirit, which I beseech thee, O Lord, may powerfully and comfortably ayde &amp; assist me now and for euermore. Lord for thy Christ his sake, in whom I onely trust to obtaine thy mercy, doe away my sinnes, and speake peace vnto my soule, against this lying serpent, that thou art and wilt be my saluation: O Lord.

create in me a cleane heart, and renue in me a right spirit, that I may learne to feare thee according to thy word: deale bountifully with me thy seruant, that I may escape these temptations, and in spight of Sathan, liue to keepe thy word: let not such contempt &amp; reproach come vpon me, but saue mee out of the iawes of hell, and from the power of Sathan, for thy names sake, and for thy mercy sake, and for thy Sonne his sake, O Lord I beseech thee. And though my soule through these temptations, cleaue vnto the dust, yet quicken thou mee according to thy word, and though the sorrowes of death hereby compasse mee in on euery side, and the terrours of hell haue now caught hold on mee, yet O Lord I beseech thee to deliuer my soule. And though Sathan hath compassed me with the multitude of his temptations, yet in thy Name, O Lord, I am confident, that I shall ouercome them. And

though thou hast suffered Sathan for a time to buffet me; yet I beseech thee as thy Sonne Iesus my Sauiour hath taught mee, in this last petition of his holy Prayer; let me be neither further led, nor come into temptation, but as in the wildernesse, after Sathans three-fold temptation of thee, thou by faith in the Word of thy Father, didst resist him, that in the end hee left thee, so that thy Angels ministred comfort to thee: so most sweet Sauiour help me, so by the same skill of thy holy Word, that I may resist Sathan, and after the battell be comforted and confirmed in obedience, by the most sweet comfort of thy holy spirit.
            O Lord my Sauiour, how did he tempt thee, to make away thy selfe, but could not preuaile? So (O Lord) strengthen mee by the same power of thy Godhead, and a true liuely faith, by which I am ingrafted into thee, that I may neuer

by Sathans power, be forced against, nor with my will, to commit the wickednesses wherewith hee tempteth mee. O Lord, hee could not enter into the Heard of Swine, vntill thou gauest him leaue: wherefore by thy vnlimitted power, curbe and restraine him, that hee enter not into mee, much lesse worke his will of mee, as he did of them. He faine would haue killed thy seruant Iob, as hee had done his children, seruants, and cattell, but thou wouldst not giue him leaue: So (O Lord) he hath striuen to doe with me, but thou hast kept mee, and resisted, and rebuked him in my behalfe: he striueth like a roaring Lyon, to make mee his prey, and beateth hard to enter into my heart, which thou hast swept and garnished, to be a receptacle for thy selfe; wherefore (O Lord) let that stronger man, euen thy holy Spirit, keepe sure my soule vnto thee, that I be not ouercome with

his furious assaults, and temptations, to let goe my hope in thy mercies: thou delightest not in the death of a sinner, but rather to shew mercy, that hee may be saued: Lord for thy mercy sake, saue mee, and helpe mee, for thy Sonnes sake keepe mee, from the rage and fury of this my great oppressour. O God, he would fame play the lying spirit vnto my soule, that he might plunge me in thy great displeasure: but (O Iesus I beseech thee) saue mee, and driue Sathan away from me, that hee neuer come at mee more. O God, he continually striueth with mee for my soule, as hee did with thine Angell, for the body of Moses, but as then thou didst defend it, and thine Angell, and in the end rebuked Sathan; So (O Lord) defend me, &amp; rebuke Sathan, that he preuaile not against me, neither in health, in sicknesse, nor yet at the point of death; but send thine Elect Angel of the couenant (Christ

Iesus) my annointed Sauiour, and his innumerable heauenly Souldiers, here to keepe me, and at my end to conduct my soule, to that place of rest, where this champion of hell, shall not once dare to defie it, or cast forth any wicked accusation against mee: and that for the merits of thy dearest Son, and sprinkling of his bloud, vnder which I expect my safety and saluation, both heere in the Church militant, and for euer in thy Church triumphant, therefore to thee most holy Trinity, and Lord God of Sabbaths, be giuen by me, and all thine, both present, and eternall praise.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            LACHRIM. 4.
            
               Wherein the distressed prayeth GOD to keepe him from despaire, howsoeuer men goe about to ruine him or his estate: not regarding (so God in his mercie and protection be with him) who or how many rise vp against him.
            
            
               IN thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
               and yet there are which daily say,
               There is no helpe for me vniust,
               but Lord thy word cannot decay:
               Thou art my God, how can they then,
               proue that thou wilt none helpe me send:
               I am brought low in sight of men,
               there's none will helpe or comfort bend:
               My basket and my store is spent,
               they say it was by thee accurst:
               Thou didst at take that h
                     •
                  dst it sent,
               but they take all things at the worst:
               At me they gape, at me they wonder,
               as at a monster seldome seene:
               On all their workes and words I ponder,
               what I now am, what I haue beene.
            
            
               
               I faint at nought, thou know'st my smart,
               th'art my Father, and doest me foster:
               What words or works, can daunt my heart,
               I am in thee become a boaster.
               These men thy might and power disable,
               or else thy loue to man diminish:
               Or else they thinke thou art vnstable,
               and doest begin, and wilt not finish:
               Or that the poore wilt not support,
               nor helpe the needie in distresse:
               But as thou knowest what they report,
               so make them feele their wickednesse.
               But I doe know thou failest neuer,
               them that in thee their trust repose.
               If they be constant and perseuer,
               all things are for the best to those.
            
            
               Thou art indeede a iealous God,
               and first thy children thou doest monish:
               Thou bear'st with loue, and beat'st with rod,
               if they mend not, wilt further punish:
               Yet call'st thy chosen children backe,
               by gentle stroakes, from running ryot,
               And sufferest them to suffer lacke,
               and doest prescribe to them their diet:
               We may condignely then deride,
               the iudgement of such foolish men,
               
                  
That vnto thee Lord will prescribe,
               the measure what, and the time when.
               Such fleshly men by wealth and woe,
               censure thy loue, or thy displeasure:
               As Natures friend, or Graces foe,
               by humane reason all things measure.
            
            
               They thinke thou lou'st whom thou feed'st fat,
               with plenty, pleasures, worldly riches:
               And that all others thou doest hate,
               these world, flesh, and deuill bewitches:
               And great is this temptation,
               vnlesse our natures thou assist:
               Infeebled with affliction,
               whose helpe doth rest in Iesus Christ.
               When thou therefore do'st me correct,
               with one hold, hold me with the other:
               Let fasth in thee make thee accept
               me for thy Sonne, by Christ my brother:
               Lay not vpon me greater loade,
               then I poore wretch can well endure.
               If I doe sinke, stay my aboade,
               and if I fall, then keepe me sure.
            
            
               Thou know'st Lord whereof I am made,
               I am a silly simple man:
               A worme, a flea, a puffe, a shade,
               
                  
that no good doe, nor no good can.
               Try by the Crosse, true to the Crowne,
               that we may proue by want and losses:
               But to dispaire, pull me not downe,
               but vnto comforts, turne my crosses:
               I am not able to beare thy yoake,
               vnlesse Christ thy Sonne doe with me draw:
               I am not able to fend thy stroke,
               vnlesse he (O Lord) doth ward the blow.
               Lord with thy mercies compasse me,
               protection draw out of despaire:
               O let me thy saluation see,
               and all things fit obtaine by Prayer.
            
            
               Thou shewest mercy to the meeke,
               that trust in thee in all mens sight:
               There children shall finde what they seeke,
               thou shalt to Sunne-shine turne their night.
               A place whence worldlings are excluded,
               and all the hellish rable out.
               Though here on earth they haue intruded,
               to roote Gods faithfull children out:
               And such as haue with hate pursu'd,
               and trusted in the arme of flesh:
               And haue their hands in bloud imbru'd,
               shall say in iudgement they were rash.
               God's on my side, who can ouerthrowe me?
               
                  
Christ pleades my cause, can God refuse me,
               As iust in Christ: the Lord doth know me,
               he doth acquite, who can accuse me.
            
            
               We thought that this mans life was madnesse,
               then shall the wicked worldlings say:
               But see his words are turn'd to gladnesse,
               whom we haue deem'd a cast-away.
               His hand hath wrought what he would haue,
               yea I my selfe shall say I err'd:
               That thought thou wouldest me not saue,
               because my ioyes were then deferr'd:
               I thought my cries thou would'st not heare,
               when I thee sought, thy selfe did'st hide:
               When I complain'd, thou cam'st not neere,
               as though thou could'st me not abide:
               But now I knowledge and confesse,
               thy wisedome great in humbling me:
               Thy loue sustain'd me in distresse,
               thy prouidence releeuing me.
            
            
               This pass'd all iudgement and conceit,
               of learnedst, grauest, wisest men:
               Therefore, deere Father, I will waite,
               take thine owne time, how, where, and when
               I will not with thy will indent:
               nor thee direct the manner how.
               
                  
Thou should'st me helpe, 'tis mine intent,
               vnto thy will to bend and bowe.
               Hereafter I will hold my peace,
               though men shall say yet still of me:
               And though their tongues will neuer cease,
               (there is for me, no helpe from thee.)

O Lord, if thou force them to cast out their goods for safety, yet will it not auaile, vnlesse therewith they cast forth by vnfained repentance their loades of sinnes, through which bodies and goods are made to sinke.

            O Lord of hoasts, and God of heauen, send thy Angels with them, to guide them forth, and conduct them safe in their return, &amp; be with them in their greatest necessities, as thou wast with thine Apostle S. Paul, in his dangerous voyage to Rome. This temporall blessing, and all others that are needfull, and that thou knowest better to giue, then I to aske; (though a chiefe of sinners, and therefore most vnworthy) yet I begge &amp; aske it, if it be thy good pleasure, for thy Sonne Iesus sake, my only Lord and Sauiour.

            A Prayer for the fruits of the earth, and other nourishments of this mortall life.
            O Eternall God, which feedest with thy blessing euery liuing thing: and satisfiest the desires of thy seruants, with thy bountifull goodnesse, wee wretched sinners, vnworthy of the least of thy blessings and benefits, doe most humbly beseech thee to be pleased, to blesse all the fruits of the earth, that wee and all thy seruants may be partakers of thy comforts therein, for the nourishment of this life. Giue vs, O Lord, this day our daily bread, prepare our ground, and prosper our corne. Blesse the seede time with the first and latter raine, and meete temperature of ayre. Keepe our fruits while they bee in the earth, from haile and thunder, from excessiue droughts, and immoderate raines, from mildewes,

and all noysome wormes. Send vs a ioyfull Haruest, and giue a blessing to that which wee shall reape, that for our vnthankfulnes it waste not away without our reliefe. Increase our cattell, with all other our prouision, which we shall carefully labour for. Replenish our basket, and blesse our store, that wee may haue wherewith, as to furnish our selues, so to giue some reliefe vnto others. Protect our seruants and workefolkes, that they may be strong to labour, wise to forecast, and faithfull in their businesse. Keepe our Garners, Barnes, and Storehouses, from fire, and boysterous windes, Theeues, and suddaine inundations. Prosper our workes and trauels, whether by sea or land, and blesse and prosper all them that any way labour for any of those things that we shall haue occasion to vse.
            Send remedy, O Lord, for all hardnesse and misery, turne our

dearth into cheapenesse, and our scarcity into plenty. Open the hearts of rich men, to whom thou hast giuen much, that they may haue a charitable respect of the poore at all times. Helpe vs (O Lord) and giue vs such things as we stand in neede of, and make vs to desire such things onely as may bee pleasing vnto thee, to search them wisely, and to finde them easily. Oppresse vs not with too much pouerty, neither puffe vs vp with too much plenty; but giue vs a competent store of things necessary for this life, and grace to vse them soberly to thy glory, and our comfort, through Iesus Christ our Lord.
            Amen.
         
         
            A thanksgiuing for our Benefactours.
            O Lord, which hast said, that hee that giueth vnto the poore, lendeth vnto the Lord, and

looke what he layeth out, it shall be payd him againe: wee beseech thee to be gracious and mercifull to all those, for whom wee are bound to pray by nature, by desert, or any other duty whatsoeuer. Of thy especiall fauour remember all our Benefactours and friends aliue, euen all those our Parents, kinsfolkes, and others, which haue brought vs vp, taught, promoted, or any way relieued vs. Blesse them with all blessings, that haue done good, either to our bodies with temporall benefits, or our soules with profitable instructions. Bless their estates, that in their godly dispositions they may haue alwayes wherewith to relieue and comfort others in their discretion: giue them the consolation of the holy Ghost, to the keeping of faith and a good conscience: And as they haue shewed mercy vnto vs, and comforted vs: so Lord, helpe and comfort them in their

greatest needes, that both they and their families may both haue comfort in their estate and condition heere, and finde mercy with thy Sonne our Sauiour Iesus at the latter day. Lord let all their almes-deedes, and prayers, be alwayes in thy sight, as those of Cornelius; that as they haue been vnto vs an odour that smelleth sweet, whereby we haue receiued plenty, and beene filled, so they may bee as sacrifices acceptable and pleasant vnto thee. Vouchsafe vs this grace, O Lord, that wee be not guilty of any ingratitude towards them, but rather ready according to our abilities, to recompence them, if neede require.
            Let not that which they haue bestowed vpon vs bee cast away, but make it fruitfull &amp; vs worthy of it. Graunt this, O thou God, which doest good both to the just and vniust, for Iesus Christs sake, our only Lord &amp; Sauiour.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            LACHRIM. 5.
            
               Wherein the distressed sheweth his desire to hold more fast the promises of God.
            
            
               O Lord, thou art my hope and strength,
               thou help'st in trouble, doe not hide
               Thy selfe for euer, but at length
               for men distrest doe thou prouide,
               For I by thee will hold most fast,
               Ile trust in thee while I doe liue:
               And till those stormes be ouer-past,
               Ile neither faint, nor feare, nor grieue.
               Tremble thou earth: rage sea and land,
               winde, tempest, stormes, and all about:
               I see thee (Lord) hold out thy hand,
               for my defence, Ile neuer doubt.
               What though hills quake, &amp; staggering stumble,
               and fall into the midst of seas.
               Though waters roare, rage, and tumble,
               thou canst this change, and all appease,
            
            
               Should I then faint at troubles small,
               which like small darts thou throw'st at me
               
                  
In loue, but not to kill at all,
               but make me leaue my vanity.
               Forsake my follies euery deale,
               reclayming errors to the truth:
               Tis thou didst hurt, and thou canst heale:
               thou hast preseru'd me from mine youth.
               I must confesse I merited,
               the death of death, with paines of hell:
               And to be disinherited
               of heauens high, where iust doe dwell.
               But Lord doe mittigate thine anger,
               and turne thy heauie wrath to loue:
               Deliuer me from all this danger,
               let thy compassion mercy moue.
            
            
               And with true comforts Christ all fountaine,
               my dry and thirsty soule refresh:
               And powre on me from holy mountaine,
               sweet dewes to glad my soule and flesh.
               Thy darts in me, O Lord, sticke fast,
               O pull them out, cast them away,
               And cure my wounds, to helpe make hast;
               binde vp my sores, soules sorrowes stay.
               Cleanse the corrupt affections,
               of my defiled wicked heart:
               Prosper and blesse mine actions,
               lighten my knowledge grosse and darke.

            MOst mighty God, &amp; Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, most louing Sauiour and Redeemer, and most blessed Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, the eternall, most glorious Trinity, which in the beginning didst create the heauen and the earth, with all the hoasts of them, and from time to time, vnto this present moment of their being, vpheld and preserued them, and all creatures, that thou diddest then make, haue euer sithence obayed thy first institution, man onely (for whom thou madest all things) excepted, which when we doe consider (O Lord) we cannot, but be much deiected in our selues, to thinke that wee whom thou hast adorned with thine owne Image, should bee fallen backe in our obedience, and become

worse then the worst of thy creatures: thou gauest vs disposition to obay thee, but wee haue despised thee, and cast away from vs the yoke of obedience, yet so great is thy mercy, that though we haue reiected thee, yet thou hast not reiected vs, but hast continued all thy couenants in full force vnto vs, as in the beginning vnto our fore-fathers.
            O Lord, from the wombe of our Parents are we risen a rebellious seede, and like the prodigall sonne, haue in the vaine imaginations of our hearts wandered from thee, so that thou canst take no pleasure nor delight in vs, or in any thing we doe: but (O Lord) wee cast downe our selues in thy sight, and presence, earnestly be

               eeching thee (as on the poore Publican) to haue mercy vpon vs, and pardon all our sinnes which wee from time to time haue done against thee. O Lord pardon our sinnes of ignorance, of omission

and commission, in the duties commanded &amp; forbidden, which wee haue neglected and not done. O Lord pardon our sins of knowledge, by which wee haue often grieued thy good spirit, that would haue hindered and detained vs from them, if wee out of the loue to them, had not too much delighted in them, &amp; stopped our eares against his holy motions and directions. O Lord, pardon our sinnes of presumption, by which wee haue most mightily offended thee: and so hardned our hearts, as wee could take no delight in the exercise of thy worship or seruice, as by the contempt of thy most holy Word and Sacraments, in our owne conscience, and in the sight of thy holy Church, vnto whom we are knowne, is most mani
                  •
               est: yet (O our most good God) doe away all our transgressions, at what time or place so euer they haue beene committed or done. (O

Lord) seperate them as farre from thee, as the East is from the West, binde them in a bundle, and drowne them from thy sight, as thou diddest the sinnes of the old world: O Lord drowne them in the huge sea of thy mercy, so as they may be cleane forgotten, for wee confesse, that if thou shouldest call vs to a reckoning and account for them, there is not the least of them, but like millstones tyed about our neckes, in the midst of the sea, would drown vs in eternall death, &amp; cōdemnation of body &amp; soule for euermore.
            But (O Lord) we beseech thee to naile our sinnes vnto the Crosse of thy deare Sonne Iesus our Sauiour, and Redeemer, and for his sake, we onely entreate thee to be at peace with vs, and thy whole Church, throughout the world. Wash our sinnes away in his most holy bloud which he shed for his Churches sake, in his agony on the mount before, and in his death

on the Crosse, for hee is the Lord our righteousnesse, who in thy secret counsell was slaine, from the beginning of the world, that wee which trust in him, by his stripes and wounds, might of our sinnes bee healed. O Lord, I beseech thee, heare these our petitions; which much like forlorne beggers, wee put vp vnto thee in thy Sonnes name, being imboldened, and encouraged this to dee, from that promise of thine, which in thy holy Gospell, thou hast giuen vs, saying: Aske and yee shall haue, seeke and yee shall finde, knocke and it shall be opened vnto you. Yea, thou hast encouraged vs heere vnto, saying; Can you that are euill, giue good gifts to your children, when they aske; and shall not I giue the holy Ghost to my children when they aske of me? And thou hast said, that hauing giuen thy Sonne vnto vs, that thou wilt with him giue vs all things else, and for his sake

deny vnto vs nothing: in conscience of the truth of this thy holy word, wee pray thee to heare vs, and to settle our hearts &amp; mindes in the knowledge, loue, and obedience of thy word and commandements to the end, and in the end of this our fraile and weake life. O Lord, considering our weakenesse, and how vnable wee are to stand in temptation: and considering how many and how great our temptations are, both in things spirituall, and things temporall; and how the deuill as a wandring and raging Lyon, raigneth throughout the world, and in the Church especially: seeking whom hee may deuoure, and considering how subtilly hee vseth, and offereth this world vnto vs, (as hee did vnto thee in the beginning of thy Ministerie, which thy Father had appointed thee in his Church) euen so by the profits and pleasures which he profereth vs, would hee cunningly

steale our hearts from thee, and thy worship vnto himselfe, which we abhorre as most wicked and vngodly: And considering how hee stirreth our vncleane hearts, and wicked corruptions, as a stinking puddle to breath forth many noysome and loathsome cogitations, and euill actions, whereby he would brand our consciences, not only to doubt of our redemption by Christ, but also of thy mercy, which is so exceeding comfortable. For all these considerations wee entreate thee to heare vs, helpe vs, and strengthen vs, in all these seuerall temptations; and as in these, so in all other, of what nature or kinde so euer they are, or shall be in this world: and that not onely in prosperity, but in aduersity, and in the strength of Sathans temptations, especially when thou shalt haue cast vs vpon the bed of sicknesse, and bring vs vnto the point of death, when we are most weake,

and Sathan in his greatest insolencie. Wherefore, O Lord, giue vs grace, that in the time of this life, we may not be negligent, but most carefull in the vse of all good meanes, whereby wee may finish our saluation in feare and trembling, for of our selues we cannot moue one foot forward vnto thy Kingdome, without thy helpe to stirre vs, inwardly by the motions of thy spirit, and outwardly by the hearing and reading of thy word, with conference, meditation, and prayer. Let not thy grace be absent at such times, but goe on with vs in blessing, helping, and guiding vs, till wee haue obtained full assurance, euen the testimony of thy holy Spirit, in our hearts witnessing vnto vs, and with vs, that thou art our God, and wee thine adopted sonnes and children (in Christ Iesus our Lord) and so may bee enabled to stand fast in loue and charity, as to all men in generall, so especially

to thy Church, which are onely the houshold of faith: O make me mercifull to the fatherlesse, to widowes indeede, to captiues, bondslaues, and all sorts that suffer aduersity in soule or body. Hauing prayed for our selues, and such things as concerne this present life, as feeling members of the misticall body of thy Church militant dispersed, and scattered throughout the whole world, we entreate thee to haue mercy vpon it, and blesse it by strengthening those that thou hast called, that we may stand fast in the profession of thy Name, and not bee ashamed of that inseparable yokefellow, thy crosse, vnder which thou hast caused vs as spirituall souldiers alwayes to warre. And graunt that by no temptations inward or outward, wee be forced to faint; but enable vs, that fighting against our most subtill aduersaries, flesh or spirit, our corrupt nature, men, or the deuill, being

               In which the distressed craueth pardon for his sinnes, the cause of all his miseries.
            
            
               O Had I wings like to a Doue,
               then should I from these troubles flie:
               To wildernesse I would remoue,
               to spend my life and there to die.
               Mongst bushes thicke, and branches tall,
               of mighty Cedars huge and hie:
               With sauages and wilde beasts all,
               for to auoyde my miserie.
               But why thus wish I, Lord▪ alas,
               that am vaine man of flesh and blood:
               Thou God that bring'st all things to passe,
               doest know, this sorts not for my good.
            
            
               
               For were 
                     •…
                  in vaste wildernesse:
               in furthest part of earth or ayre:
               I could no whit my case redresse,
               as being in thy power there.
               Were I in bowells of the earth,
               were I in sea, in cloudes or skie:
               With sorrow, griefe, with ioy or mirth,
               there Lord thou art with powerfull eye,
               There canst thou also finde me out,
               and visite there my foule effence:
               Thou art my pathes and bed about,
               tis vaine to hide or feele defence.
               Then let me at thy footestoole fall,
               and there acknowledge mine amisse:
               For pardon begge, and mercy call,
               and pray for griefe and heauenly blisse:
               And that thou bridle my desires,
               cleanse mine affections with thy spirit.
               Inflame me with thy holy fire,
               in nought but thee let me delight.

               where is no loss nor paine of sence.

               and so enioy true happinesse.
               O make not Lord thy absence long,
               but hasten my deliuerance.
               Against my foes Lord make me strong,
               which doe themselues 'gainst me adua

               for to assault my silly soule:
               Wearied with stormes that doe accrewe,
               and plung'd with waues which o're me roule.
               Wherefore hast thou left vnto vs,
               by thy word a commandement,
               To cast our care on thee which thus
               with weighty burthens vs torment.
               With promise to vs helpe and ease,
               thou seest and know'st Lord our desire:
               Our secret hearts, and all our wayes.
               all's plaine to thee as light, as fire.
               If therefore I should iustifie
               my selfe, I should condemned be:
               Thou find'st me out, and do'st me trie,
               
                  
my righteousnesse is nought to thee,
               Disclayming my integrity,
               I cast me downe Lord at thy feete:
               And pray for pure sincerity,
               that I doe all in all that's meete.
            
            
               Wherefore thou art most mercifull,
               when wants and weakenesse we confesse:
               Yea, then thy gifts are plentifull,
               vs to relieue in our distresse.

            A Prayer in the time of plague, or other extraordinarie sicknesse.
            O Lord our GOD, in whose name standeth our helpe, and who (amongst other euills) hast promised vs to deliuer thy people from the 
                  〈◊〉
                of the Hunter, and the noysome Pestilence, wee beseech thee take this thy Plague away from vs: And as the stench of our sinnès hath ascended vp into thy nosthrills, to prouoke thy wrath against vs: so let our humble supplications come before thee, to procure our happy and speedie release from it.
            Lord call backe thine Angell, and cause him to sheath the sword

againe. We are thy children, the worke of thy hand, we are sorrie for our sinnes, which are the cause of all this: and wee purpose amendment: wee are but men, dust and ashes, not able to beare long; therefore Lord haue mercy vpon vs, and that soone, send vs comfort, and suffer vs not to perish after so miserable a sort. We thanke thee, O Lord, that thou hast not left vs altogether comfortlesse, without hope, but hast somewhat withdrawne thine hand, and spared many hundred of vs, in comparison of those whom thou slewest before: and now wee reioyce at this abatement, yet stand in awe, we presume vpon this thy fauour, but with feare and trembling: wee trust it shall be euery day better, yet we are carefull to winne it by pleasing thee. Wherefore, O Lord, wee beseech thee blesse vs, and all those that depend vpon

vs; set thy sauing marke vpon our houses, as thou didst for the Israelites, and giue or er to the destroyer that hee hurt vs not. Put thy strength to our medicines: guard our regard which wee haue of our selues: let thy good blessings make the preseruatiues of the Physitians, and our shifting places for more security, profitable vnto vs, and let vs not trust too much to outward means, but chiesely in thy mercy, and blessing vpon them. Keepe vs downe-lying and vp-rising, and protect vs walking in our vocations: haue pittie vpon our distressed brethren, comfort the desolate widowes, prouide for all fatherlesse children. Gather vs together againe, that by these meanes are dispersed, and continue thy mercifull worke in deminishing our dead numbers, till wee may iustly say in confidence and thankes with the Prophet,

we shall not die but liue, and declare the workes of the Lord.

O good IESVS, which hast created mee, and redeemed mee with thine owne blood, suffer not mee whom thou hast made of nought to be damned; O good IESVS, let not my wickednesse haue power to destroy me whom thine Almighty goodnesse hath made.

            The Sicke-mans Prayer.
            O Louing Lord, and most holy Father, I poore wretch thy seruant, feeling in this sicknesse which thou hast layd vpon me, the punishment of that corruption and transgression that is in me, and all flesh, doe most willingly submit my selfe to thine holy ordinance, to beare this crosse, and taste of this bitter cup which I haue deserued, and much more, so that I may follow thee whither thou art gone. Therefore, O Lord, since thou hast not yet called mee to the barre of death, but sent thy Heraulds to summon me to a triall: I beseech

thee looke on me with thine eye of mercifull pittie, and helpe me in this day of visitation: powre out thine oyle of grace into my wounded conscience, purge my defiled soule, forgiue mee all my sinnes, and giue mee competent comfort and consolation in this distresse: let me not dye ere I begin to liue; giue mee time to repent, and occasion to amend: but if thou wilt needes put any more of thy wine of correction into my festered sores; lay no more (O Lord) lay no more vpon me, then I shall bee able to beare: Make good vnto mee that goodnesse, which thou hast graunted me vnder the great seale of thy promise: Supply my want, pardon my sinnes, and ayde me against all temptations, and I am recouered of all mine infirmities: I offer here vnto thee (O Lord) a penitent heart for the time past, and promise through thy grace amendment,

if it shall please thee to draw out the threed of my life any longer: yet I neither desire the continuance of this mortality, nor a more speedy deliuerance, otherwise then as thou wilt: Lord looke not vpon my merits, for they are either none or not good; nor vpon my life, for it hath been naught; but looke vpon Christ thy deere Sonne, who from the Altar of the crosse, cried vnto thee on my behalfe, and accept his satisfaction for my sinnes.
            Arme mee with patience to take vp my crosse &amp; follow thee, euen to beare my visitation willingly; and giue mee strength by faith, to resist the Aduersary in the brunt of temptations.
            With my sorrow and paine encrease thy grace, that when I am in greatest agony, I may find comfort, beleeuing and saying with the holy Prophet, My flesh faileth, and my heart also, but God

is the strength of my heart, and my portion for euer. O Lord, if thy decree be gone forth, as it was to H

O Lord, thou didst beyond all hope, and expectation, raise Lazarus stinking in the graue, and Peters wiues mother of a burning beauer, and the woman of her bloudie issue, and the man that was irrecouerable of the dead Palsie, onely by thy vertue and power.

            O Lord, as hee hath abounded

with charity, and compassion vnto others, in their extreamities of sicknesse: so likewise (as thou hast promised) let this thy mercifull seruant, in his languishing paines, obtaine mercy from thee, that art most mercifull, and as hee hath heard the lamenting cries of others: so Lord doe thou heare his mournefull and lamenting sighes vnto thee, for thou art very pittifull, and of tender mercy. O Lord, he humbleth himselfe in thy sight, wherefore I beseech thee to raise him vp againe, if any man be sicke, thou hast willed vs that be well, to pray one for another, assuring vs that the Prayer of the righteous, if it be seruent, auaileth much; In confidence and full assurance, that thou wilt make good thy word: O Lord, I earnestly beseech thee, to restore my sicke and weake friend (N) vnto his perfect health (if it may bee thy good pleasure) and this I aske

as one not without hope, for I beleeue, that as Iesus died and rose againe, euen so by his power shall this my sicke friend doe at the last day. Yet, O Lord, for the perfecting of that which is wanting in his faith, repentance, and good works; I earnestly beseech thee to adde some more vnto the number of his dayes, haue mercy vpon him, and restore him againe to strength, &amp; his former health.
            But most mercifull Father, if thou please through this his sicknesse, to finish his dayes: graunt that he may in quiet minde, and stedfast faith, commend to thee, the care of all his worldly charge, because thou hast promised to be a Father vnto the widdowe, and the fatherlesse. And it is thy wil, that wee should cast our care on thee, not onely in life, but in death especially. O Lord, when death that cruell tyrant, sinne, the graue, the deuill, and all the fries of

darknesse, shall assault his body, and affright his soule with distrust in thee, and of his part in the glorious resurrection; then strengthen him, by the power of thy Sonne my Sauiour, that hee may no lesse triumph ouer all the terrours and feares of the graue, of hell, and death, as all the Saints in like case haue done, and then I my selfe may doe, in the same houre of my departure; which I beseech thee to graunt, through him that hath loued vs, euen Iesus Christ my most absolute and perfect Sauiour.

               and by correction grieu'd mine heart:
               If thou wilt cure, salue soone is found,
               with spirituall comfort ease my smart.
            
            
               Doe not withhold such things are good,
               which for thy children are ordain'd:
               Turne thou thy face with Christes blood,
               cleanse all the spots my sinnes hath stain'd.
               
                  
Rise vp, O Lord, rise vp I say,
               with thee doth Loue and Bounty raigne:
               I am throwne downe, I thee obay,
               therefore rise vp, raise me againe.
               Although my sinnes like swords doe cut,
               me from thy fauour and thy grace:
               Let righteousnesse of Christ be put,
               to hide my sinnes before thy face.
               Unite me vnto thee againe,
               in such sort Lord, make me so fast:
               That I with thee may still remaine,
               and ioy in ioyes, that aye shall last.
            
         
         
            The young mans Prayer for a vertuous wife.
            O God the euerliuing, and only wise, the Author, and giuer of euery good and perfect gift, looke downe vpon mee, a
                  •
                thou didst vpon Abimelech Abrahams seruant, when he prayed vnto thee, to guide and prosper him, in the great trust, that was committed vnto him, in the

choise of his Masters sonnes wife: as thou wast pleased to heare him, for his Masters sonne (O Lord I beseech thee) to heare me for my selfe. Thou hast taught in thy Word, that he that cannot abstaine, let him marrie, and that he that marrieth sinneth not, that it is better to marrie then to burne (in vnchast and vnbrideled lust) and for auoyding of fornication, let euery man haue his owne wife, yea and that it is not good for man to be alone; and woe to him that is alone. In the beginning thou madest both male and female, and didstordaine, that for this cause man and woman should leaue father and mother, and become one flesh: and that hee that hath not the gift to abstaine, should haue a care, that he be not vnequally yoked: but that he marrie in the Lord, and thus to liue is a bed vndefiled, and most honourable vnto all. Wherefore, O

Lord, I beseech thee, to guide me vnto a wife, and a vertuous woman, for thou hast said, that a vertuous woman is a crowne vnto her husband; And though she bee comely and beautifull, and therefore of many much desired: yet (O Lord) guide mine eyes, that I may not thus onely looke vpon a woman; for thou hast said, if shee haue not discretion, she is but like a iewell in a swines snout, not to be regarded. But a wise woman buildeth her husbands house, not onely with children, but with her prouident care and discretion, in the right gaining, and a right vsing of the things of this world. Vnto such a family (O Lord) direct my footsteps, and keepe mee from the strange woman, a contentious and angry woman, the woman of brawling lips, with whom there is no comfort, nor content in this life to dwell, neither for ciuill

nor religious respects. Heauenly Father, if it be thy will (for thou knowest what is better for mee then I doe my selfe) graunt that the woman that I shall chuse, and by thy prouidence thinke fit to take to wife, may bee chast not onely of body, but of spirit, and adorned with the hidden man of the heart, a meeke and quiet spirit, and one who trusteth in God, and delighteth in thee, well reported of for good workes, and loueth children, one who in her wisedome affecteth modesty in all things; as in her apparell, and behauiour, and is in her countenance sober and shamefast, and one who delighteth in her home, and loueth the affaires of her house; and with watchfull eyes will be carefull for her children and seruants. This (O Lord) though no way worthy, I beseech thee to graunt vnto me: houses, lands, or other portions of thy blessings, thou

hast appointed our parents to bestowe on vs, but (this blessing) a wise, chast, sober, and religious woman, thou hast kept, as a most speciall gift, from thy selfe vnto vs, and not in our parents or friends, but thou bestowest it on him whom thou louest, as a choise and most speciall fauour. O Lord, this is she that Salomon among many women, could hardly finde; yet graunt that I may finde her, and being vnited in holy band, may loue her both in sicknesse and in health. O Lord graunt that I may walke with her, as a man of knowledge, readie in all things to teach and instruct her in thy commaundements, as being heires together of the grace of life, and make mee as truely to loue her, as thou doest thy Church: this great gift and chiefe blessing of this life, I beseech thee (if it bee thy will) for the honour

of thy Sonne to bestow vpon me.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            The Uirgine or the Widdowes Prayer for a godly Husband.
            ALmighty GOD the eternall Creatour of heauen &amp; earth, the giuer &amp; disposer of all things, that are done heere on earth: Looke downe on mee thy sinfull Handmayd, not worthy of any fauour spirituall, or blessing temporall: Yet (O Lord) I beseech thee, to giue vnto mee thy seruant, such wisedome, that in all things I may be aduised by them whom thou hast appointed to haue care of my welfare, and in nothing to bee so headstrong and aduerse, as to follow my owne foolish and sinfull appetite: and aboue all, make me most dutifull, in referring my selfe vnto the

louing and carefull choise, that my parents or guardians shall make, in giuing me to an husband.
            Heauenly Father, graunt that they may not like of any without mee, nor that I may choose any without them. Direct them that they may chuse one in the Lord, and that I may like him that is so chosen of them: Let not my minde be so wanton, as onely to like or dislike for want of beauty or comelinesse of person: but if the feare of the Lord, the beginning of wisedome, appeare vnto mee, graunt that I may perswade my selfe, that hee is the man, that thou hast appointed me. O Lord, I haue neither wit nor skill how to discerne, or make an assured godly choise. And thou knowest how cunning and subtill men are, to entice and abuse my simple heart, and how easily we are ouercome, with their vaine complements, and flattering words, in

which they promise much comfort and contentment: but when their vnchast desires are satisfied, how doe they cast off, and scornfully and sinfully reiect those whom they haue abused and allured to folly, so they leaue them to perish, not onely in worldly misery through outward necessities, but for want of teaching and instruction in the Lord, Sathan falleth vpon them, and through their weakenesse maketh them a prey vnto wickednesse. But (O Lord) though their foule hearts are so deceiptfull, that both I and my friends may be deceiued; yet thou, O Lord, canst not be deceiued, for thou art the searcher of the hearts, and thou knowest what is in man; therefore in this weighty worke, in which consisteth my worldly weale or wee, I doe onely (O Lord) cast my selfe on thee: beseeching thee as thou gauest Euah vnto Adam, a man

then of innocencie and righteousnesse: so thou wilt giue me an honest hearted man, and one that truly loueth and feareth thee: O Lord, if thou haue appointed, as is my desire, that I shall marrie, then I beseech thee send vnto mee a man of good behauiour, of good report, no extortioner, no couetous person, no chollericke, no quarelsome person, no drunkard, not couetous of filthy and dishonest gaine, no prodigall or vaine person, no proud man, no adulterer, fornicatour, whoremaster, no swearer or blaspheamer, no kinde of inordinate liuer, no Papist nor Infidell, no Hereticke, Schismaticke, no traytour vnto his Prince or Countrey, no louer of the pleasures of this world, either aboue or more than thee; no hypocrite, vnnaturall, falsehearted person vnto mee, his parents, or friend: heauenly Father, for my Sauiours sake, heare me in

these my requests, and graunt that if I shall marrie, and beare children, that my husband may be wise, graue, and sober, and one that knoweth how to gouerne, and rule his houshold, children, and seruants, in faith and good conscience.
            O Lord, let him be one that is stedfast in the faith of Christ, following righteousnesse, loue, faith, patience, and meekenesse, and one delighted in good workes and hospitality, courteous vnto all men: O Lord, make him a louer of good men, and make him iust, holy, and in all things temperate, euer walking in grace, &amp; abounding in the fruits of the Spirit: O good God send mee such a yokefellow, that knoweth how to loue me, not onely by the guide of carnall affection, as for beauty, comelinesse of person, money &amp; goods which thou hast giuen me, or for that I haue good friends and kindred,

whereby he hopeth of this worlds preferment and ability; for if all these faile, for the which he onely loueth, then will his pretended loue be gone, and I shall be exposed to the necessity of this world, and for want of meanes be tempted to dishonest courses: but most sweet Father, as thou hast promised to be a Father vnto the fatherlesse, vnto the Widdowes and Orphanes: So be a Father vnto mee, thy silly Handmayd, whose trust is alwayes in thee. And send mee such an one, as knoweth how to loue mee in thee, and for conscience sake: yea, that will striue to loue me as Christ hath, doeth, and euer will doe his Church, to loue me as his owne body, This fie
                  •
               h, yea, as himselfe. And keepe mee that I may doe nothing to hinder this his loue, or to make him bitter vnto mee; but that I may obay him, 
                  •
               care him, and loue him in

all things, that are comely in the Lord, and according as thou hast commanded mee in thy holy word, and that for Christ Iesus sake, to whom with thee and the holy Ghost, bee giuen by mee all praise &amp; glory, both now and for euermore.
            Amen. Amen.
         
         
            The Prayer of a Woman with child, that defireth safe deliuerance.
            O Almighty God, that after the floud, didst command Noah, and his posterity, liuing in chast matrimony, to replenish and fill the earth; I thy poore and most weake seruant, haue as thou didst ordaine, by the will of my parents, embraced the holy and honourable estate of married life, and now by thy blessing, am made a mother of the liuing, through that hopefull 
                  •
               ruit, which after

much sorrow and paine in breeding, thou hast caused to spring in my wombe, by which I am assured it is a liuing soule, for which worke of thine, I giue thee most hearty thanks, still beseeching thee, that as thou hast begun this good worke in mee, that thou wilt goe on and finish it, vnto a perfect birth, in all right shape and comelinesse, not onely in the outward feature of the body, but in the inward parts of the minde, that it may growe on vnto such a perfect man, as may occasion, honour and praise vnto thy great name, so long as it shall please thee, to giue it life and being. And seeing (O Lord) thou hast for our first sinne in Paradise, so wofully afflicted vs with many sorrowes in conception, and with farre greater in bringing forth of our posterity in this life: I beseech thee for Christ his sake to pardon my sinnes, and to asswage

those violent and raging paines, that they neither deface, deforme, destroy mee, nor yet that which is in my wombe. O Lord, let the power of the most high, euen thy holy Spirit enter into me, to strengthen and to vphold me, that I faint not in my paines, nor in my faith, but that if I dye in this my child-bearing, yet thy goodnesse supporting me in faith, charity, and sobriety, I may as thou hast promised bee assured of my saluation. O Lord, if thou please to spare the tree, and take the fruit, which I beleeue by faith in Christ that thou hast made holy: yet I will giue thee thankes, because by reason of my sinnes, thou mightest most iustly curse mee, and my fruit (as thou didst the figge tree) to perpetual death.
            But most high &amp; heauenly Father, I thanke thee that thou hast made thy promise so stable, that not onely we of ripe yeares, that

doe beleeue, but euen our children, as they are our seede, are included in the couenant of grace; that if they dye, yet being borne of holy parents, who are ingraffed through faith into the body of Christ, they are saued, not onely as being a part of vs in Christ, but as true and reall members of Christ, vnto whō through faith, into which they are baptized with vs, &amp; made one with Christ, that with his comming, they may bee raised at the last day. Yet (O Lord) notwithstanding this assurance, I entreate thee to graunt me ioy and comfort of them, that trayning them vp, in their youth in thy feare, they may bee as a staffe in olde age, in this life to comfort me, an
                  •
                their Father, as the children of Noah and Iacob did; yea (Lord) if it be thy will, I desire to liue, to bee a fruitfull vine, on thy house side (thy Church, to breede, to beare, and

bring forth children, to multiply and accomplish thy glorious Kingdome, visible and inuisible, in earth and in heauen for euermore.
            O Lord, hauing taken away from mee, the reproach of a barren wombe, so much lamented by holy women: graunt that after my dissolution, my children may continue like oliue plants, and flourish a seede mighty on earth, not as the Giants in the olde world, strong in sinne, but valiant and bold in the profession, and confession, and practise of righteousnesse, and good conuersation, yea, let them be a generation of vpright men and women, and such as may remaine an heritage of the Lord, as (Isaac to Rebecka) a blessed fruit of my wombe. O Lord, thou art my God, heare the voyce of thine handmayd, in thee is my trust, heare my supplications, and let not my soule faile of

these her desires, and that for Iesus Christes sake, which was borne of the virgine Mary for my saluation.
            Amen. Amen.

               The penitent acknowledgeth mans vildnesse, and Gods mercies; by faith and example of Gods prouidence, relieth on his goodnes.
            
            
               O Lord, thy name's most excellent,
               in all the world thy glory is spread;
               Through heauens and the firmament,
               and by all creatures vttered.
               In vniuersall harmonie,
               extoll'd in heauen and in earth:
               Exprest in song and melodie,
               with all alacritie and mirth.
               What thou bestowest, what man can number
               vpon vs slaues, and sonnes of men:
               Who by our sinnes are put asunder
               from thy deare loue, by acts vncleane,
               Forgetfull, and so capeable
               
                  
of sinne as powder is of fire.
               In all our workes and words vnstable,
               and know not what we should desire.
            
            
               Aboue all creatures we forget,
               thy grace are proue to disobay:
               And if thy mercy did not let,
               all Adams broode thou shouldst destroy.
               And I for my part me confesse,
               guilty of all sinnes, and all euills.
               And that I haue deseru'd no lesse,
               then to be damn'd amongst the deuills.
               The world for disobedience
               didst punish, and thou moughtest subuert.
               But chiefely me for negligence,
               mayest plague with all plagues, 'tis desert.
            
            
               I am not worthy to breathe in ayre,
               nor haue the vse of any creature:
               Much lesse to thee to make my prayer,
               cause 'gainst my God I am a traytour.
               Thou worthily me do'st afflict,
               at me thou takest iust offence:
               All punishments thou doest inflict,
               because thy wrath I did incense.
               My trespasses doe more offend,
               
                  
then I can please with my best zeale:
               The worthinesse I best intend,
               I not performe, my soule Lord heale.
            
            
               I shame at mine vnworthinesse,
               yet faine would be at one with thee:
               Thou art a ioy in heauinesse,
               a succour in necessity,
               To them that doe their liues reforme,
               and rightly frame their penitence:
               Sincerely follow and performe,
               thy will without all negligence.
               All this to doe I doe desire,
               and what thou sayest I doe beleeue:
               Thy pardon graunt me I require,
               release and pardon Lord me giue.
               O be with them that doe thee seeke,
               and yeeld them helpe that hold by thee:

               that wisedome seeke by thy mercy.
            
            
               Sith I so long to thee haue cried,
               so long thee sought, yet hope I will:
               Though my sad soule in silence bide,
               in constant Patience I wayte still.
               Thou rightly hear'st my inward groanes,
               
                  
my sorrowes, fighes, wants and desire:
               And doest respect the outward moanes,
               of men distrest that feare the fire.
               Though in their lips they mute doe seeme,
               and doe speake nothing with their tongues.
               What they conspire, thou doest it deeme,
               and present art to right my wrongs.
               But loe the time is not expir'd,
               of mine ordained punishment:
               Nor of that freedome I desir'd,

               saluation mine depends on thee:

               My life, my comfort, helpe, and all
               saluation, on Christ dependeth:
               'Tis he doth raise me when I fall,
               he all begins, and he all endeth.

               Thy power, thy prouidence, thy word,
               doe send me comfort from aboue.
               O blessed man whom thou doest chuse,
               and callest by crosses vnto thee,
               Whom thou by death seem'st to refuse,
               
                  
by secret sweetnesse liues by thee.
               With inward consolation,
               fed with the Manna of thy loue:
               Who dwells in thy protection,
               with liuely hope, can neuer moue.
            
            
               He fainteth not at mightiest frowne,

               Thou art my portion and my crowne,
               to dignifie those loue thee best.
               Thou tendrest me as a deare sonne,
               though thou me visite with thy rod:
               Yet suff

               Yet I (O Lord) shall be reuiu'd
               by thee, and by thy grace at last,
               For all my long and instant cries
               I will not shrinke; though knowing this
               Thy wonderous power and great mercies,
               most infinite thy mercy is.
            
            
               If thou mad'st the rocke a water spring,
               thy thirsty people to refresh:
               From mine hard hearted foes canst wring

               If thou rain'dst Manna from aboue,
               and Rauen sent thy Saint to feede:
               Thousands of men didst feede with loue,
               when there was little shew of bread.
               If to thy people thou sendest Quailes,
               in desert where all foode was scant:
               And since thy goodnesse neuer failes,
               should I suppose that I should want.
               Confirme my faith for euermore,
               that I most constantly beleeue,
               Thou canst and wilt encrease my store,
               and all good things thou wilt me giue.
            
            
               All power belongeth vnto thee,
               who can imagine or will say:
               Thou canst not in my neede helpe me,
               or that thy loue is tane away.
               Sith thou hast done such mighty things,
               so freely for men in distresse:
               Should not I flye with swiftest wings,
               to thee in time of heauinesse.
               But loe, O Lord, all things are thine.
               the heauens are thine, the earth also:
               The cattell, fowles, the shrubs, the vines,
               all things in heauen and earth belowe.
               
                  
All things aboue, all things beneath
               is thine, who truly then can say?
               Thou canst not giue, or them bequeath,
               to whom thou wilt, who can say nay?
            
            
               Thou mak'st the corne to spring and grow,
               and waterst the earth with thy sweet showres:
               Thou causest beasts with thanks to lowe,

               Since then thou art the Lord of all,
               sith thou command'st, and doest forbid.
               The rich and poore makest, proud men fall,
               that downe canst throwe and raise at neede.
               Sith that thou try'st and wilt reward,
               sith thou doest what shall please thy will:
               And in what manner wilt regard,
               and whom thou wilt canst saue or spill.
               No liuing man commandeth thee,
               not all the world can thee controle:
               O Lord I still will pray to thee,
               for health of body and of soule.
               Let it be thus, O Father deare,
               for Christ his sake, thy dearest Sonne,
               That dy'd, and rose my soule to cleare:
               in all things (Lord) thy will be done.
            
            
               
               All glory to the Trinity,
               to Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost:

               of power, and might, and glory most.
            
         
         
            A Prayer for loue and charity.
            O Almighty God, the Author and giuer of all things, of grace especially, vnto thee, a most vile &amp; wretched sinner, and chiefe of sinners, doe I prostrate my selfe, and confesse, that my heart is so hardned in euill custome of sinne, that when it commeth vpon me, by the motion of thy spirit to desire to doe good, I finde no meanes in my selfe, to doe any thing that is good, neither for the vertue it selfe, nor as it is thy commandement; so that thou mightest most worthily cast mee off, as thou didst that vnmercifull seruant, into bonds of death, and imprisonment of hell for euermore.

But, O Lord, it is thy property alwayes to haue mercy. Wherefore I beseech thee to bestowe this gift of loue on me, that through thy acceptation, it may couer in mee the multitude of my sinnes, for vnto whom thou forgiuest much, much is returned to thee againe: wherefore (O Lord) let this gift of loue, bee mighty and strong in me, that I may loue thee againe, as thou hast loued me, and expresse my loue, by being ready to forgiue all wrongs and offences of my brother and neighbour, and not vnto seauen times, but vnto seauenty times seauen. O let mee loue thee and my neighbour out of a sincere faith, and loue vnfained, and at all times as thou hast forgiuen mee, my debts, offences, and trespasses: So (O Lord) make me ioyfull and willing to forgiue, as I desire of thee to be forgiuen. And seeing it is the end of thy Commandements,

and the fulfilling of the law (O heauenly Father) let this gift of loue, through the operation of thy spirit, bee neuer wanting, or absent in this life, nor in the life to come. O Lord graunt that this marke of Adoption, and stampe of Regeneration, may encrease in mee, not onely to my friends in affinity, and consanguinity, and acquaintance, but vnto all men in generall, as my owne flesh, and thy image, by which bonds thou hast commanded mee to doe good, vnto all of all sorts, that shall stand in neede of my helpe, saying, Be you mercifull, as your heauenly Father is mercifull, who doeth good vnto all, in outward things of this world, causing his raine to raine, and his Sunne to shine vpon the vniust as vpon the iust. And in the endeauour of doing this generall good, (O Lord) let mee not forget, to doe most good vnto the Saints,

and dye in loue to all men in thee, and for thee: and that through the loue of thee, and my onely Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, and the holy Ghost for euermore.

               O Lord come pittie my distresse,
               see how I sigh and groane:
               With teares and floods of heauinesse,
               my heart is ouerthrowne.
               No hope I finde, no helpe I feele,
               no cure nor salue I see.
               None can my sinnes corruptions heale,
               sweet Iesus comfort me.
            
            
               My wounding sorrowes neuer cease,
               my griefes growe more and more:
               What I should kill, doth still encrease,
               
                  
Lord saue my soule therefore.
               I liuing dye, yet dying liue:
               in life, yet daily dye.
               I sigh and groane, yet cannot grieue,
               sinne makes this mysterie.
            
            
               Lord let me liue, yet hourely dye,
               in loue, yet daily hate:
               Let me embrace, yet still defie,
               let peace breede all debate.
               O let me liue, yet neuer liue,
               aliue, yet euer dead.
               O let me grieue, yet neuer grieue,
               fed with thy liuing bread.
               Let passions passe, let groanes be gone:
