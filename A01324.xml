            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the Christian Reader.
            
               ALlen the Author of the Popish challenge (as it is now confessed) and of the Booke of Purgatorie, as he alwayes acknowledged, finding mine answere to both these treatises, so well grounded vpon the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, and testimonies of the most ancient writers, that albeit he might quarell at many bie matters, yet he was not able to auoyd the substance of mine arguments, and answeres: determined not to aduenture his credite, in publishing any replie vnder his owne name, and therefore turned ouer the businesse to one Bristowe, whose impudence being approued in his Motiues, and demaundes, was thought more meete to take so desperate a cause in hand. Bristowe himselfe on the otherside, perceiuing that it was impossible for him to make any shewe of replie, that might satisfie any meane witte, if hee should followe me orderly and directly, from point to point, as I haue followed Allen, durst not once vndertake that lawfull course of replying, which I haue alwayes obserued in answering, but by confounding of many diuers matters together, hath sought to bring a great mist vpon the cause, vnder which hee might rather hide then defende his master Allen, and he himselfe like a pretie man, nowe and then start out and giue a perilous blowe, and so retyre into

his cloude againe. For this purpose it was not sufficient for him, leauing all order of replying, to take vpon him the confutation of two books of myne, of most diuerse matters, in one of his, but that the confusion might bee greater, and the light of trueth appeare much lesser, he must defende two more of his owne. So that hauing nowe iumbled together no lesse then sixe treatises in one, two of Allens, two of mine, and two of his owne, he thinketh himselfe so well armed with darkenes and confusion, that if he cannot haue a conquest, yet he may be sure to haue a starting hole to hide himselfe in. And first he findeth great fault that his motiues and demaunds (which most men for the great follie shewed in thē dispised) were not first answered: dreming that my books should neuer haue beene put in print, but to make a shewe of answere to his motiues and demaunds. But how vainely he gesseth, mine answere printed, to those wodden workes of his, doth plainely discouer. Of like vanitie and more impudence it is, that hee affirmeth constantly, that I was faigne to set foorth those bookes without priuiledge (albeit I say the one was authorized) distinguishing betweene priuiledge and authoritie, wherein I know not what the peeuish quareller meaneth. For this I am sure, that both those bookes, had such approbation and license to be printed, as al bookes concerning religion ought to haue, by the Queenes iniunctions, which I call &amp; count a sufficient authorizing. Concerning priuileging, I suppose Bristowe cauelleth, because he knoweth not what the name of a priuiledge signifieth, for which I will

remit him to some lawyer to learne. But where I affirmed, that my booke was authorised two yeares before it was imprinted, he douteth whether he may beleeue my bare word, because I write in the same, We beleue that the Catholike Church hath no cheefe gouernour vpon earth, but Christ, vnto whom all power is giuen in heauen &amp; in earth. But I pray thee Bristow, what doth this hinder thee to beleeue me vpon my bare word? Thou demandest a question in the margent, What if the Church were in England onely, or one were King of all Countries, sometime where it is? I might, according to Salomons aduise, answere thee according to thy folly, &amp; deferre my resolution vntill either the Church be in England only: or that one were King of all Countries where it is. But lest thou shouldst thinke thy selfwise in thy folish question, I answere, that if either of both those cases should come to passe, which are both impossible: Christ should stil reteine his office and power that he hath in heauen and earth, and that one King of England, or of many coūtries, should haue no more authoritie ouer the Church, then the Queene of England now hath ouer that portion of the Church, that is in England, or ouer all those portions that are in other her seuerall dominions.
            But whereas Bristow saith, my former booke commeth forth only by permissiō to make a shew of somewhat for a time, &amp; if after it chaunce of some Papist to be dasht out of countenance, then the shame to be no mans but onely Fulkes: I wish the gentle reader to consider two thinges. First, that he will charge no

man with the shame of mine errors, if any he can proue, but me onely, as in deede there is no reason that any man should beare the blame of my folly, but my selfe, &amp; least of al the church of God. Secōdly that by quarelling at the want of priuiledge and authorizing of my writinges, he acknowledgeth this his owne booke of reply, to lacke neither priuiledge nor authoritie, so that if I not onely dash it out of countenaunce, but also shewe it to be voyde of wisdome, learning and trueth, the shame shall not be priuate to Bristow alone, but cōmon to all the popish faction beyond the sea, &amp; on this side the same, by whose cō
               mon consent it seemeth to be penned and set foorth. Bristows reply is conteined in 13. Chapters, to euery of which, and to euery part of them, as they are intitled by himselfe, I will answere in order, that they which liste to conferre my Reioynder with his Reply, may see I seeke not by confusion to couer any falshood, but by orderly proceeding to bring the trueth to light.

            A REIOYNDER TO BRISTOWES REPLY IN DEFENCE OF ALLENS SCROLL OF ARTICLES AND BOOKE OF PVRGATORIE.
            By W. F. D. in diuinitie.
            
               The first Chapter.
               
                  I will shew briefely that Fulke confesseth, out of the true Church Bristowe. to be no saluation.
               
               
                  FVlke hath alwayes beleeued Fulke. since god gaue him knowledge of his trueth, &amp; therefore freely confessed, that out of the true Church of Christ, there can be no saluation. But whereas Bristowe inferreth that it is openly practized in the Popish Church, to take in men by Baptisme first, and then by reconciliation to receiue them if any went out, or were cast out: thereby to insinuate, that the Popish Church is the true Church, it is an argument voyde of al consequens. For if the ceremoniall outward practise of baptisme &amp; reconciliation, were able to proue the practizers to bee the true Church, not onely the papistes, but all other sects of heretikes practizing the same, should be ye true Church. This is the first argument, and as good as the best he maketh, to proue the heresie of Popery to be the true Church of Christ.
            
            
               
               CAP. II.
               
                  That he confesseth the knowne Church of the first 600 yearès Bristowe. after Christ and the knowne members thereof.
               
               I beleeue that the Church of Christ, hath continued from the Apostles vnto this day, and shall doe from Fulke. henceforth to the ende of the worlde. And I do confesse that for 600. yeares and more, after Christ, the doctrine of saluation in all necessarie articles was taught in the knowne and visible Church, although with all, in the later times, was receiued much corruption. I acknowledge also the auncient writers, Bishops, Emperors and Monkes of those times, to haue beene members of the same visible Church. But whereas Bristowe saith, to that I adde of the late Emperors, I signifie that I meane the Emperors Constantine, Iouian, Valentinian, &amp;c. to haue beene such as I woulde wish for: I aunswere, he is no good interpreter of my meaning. For although in comparison of the later Emperors, they were much more excellent, yet I neuer ment to acknowledge them to be such, as I would wishe for: For both in the religion and in their manners, diuers thinges are founde, which I woulde wish had beene more agreeable to the worde of God, &amp; yet were they in their time, very godly and Christian Princes, holding the foundation of Christ. I hope, to their eternall saluation.
               Other bymatters there be in this Chapter, in which I am carped of Bristowe. First, that ignorantly I affirme, somewhere, namely Purg. 371. that the controuersie betwene the Britains and Saxons about the celebration of Easter, was the same, that was betweene Victor Bishoppe of Rome, and the Christians of Asia: whereas I saide, they defended a ceremonie receiued of the East Church, euen as the East church did long before against Victor 
                     〈◊〉
                  . of Rome: for they defende it by example and authoritie of S Iohn the Euangelist, Bed. hist. lib. 3. cap. 25. and so did the Asians, Euseb. lib. 5. Cap. 24.
               
                  
Secondly where I saye, that Athanasius and a fewe other, that were banished and persecuted, were the true Catholike Church: he noteth in the margent, such is his skill in the story of that time: Belike he is offended, that I say they were but a fewe, that tooke parte with Athanasius. How smal or great my skill is in ye storie of that time, Bristows practise of logike is but little, which remembreth not yt many &amp; fewe are relatiues, and spoken in comparison: I say againe they were but few in comparison of ye Arrians, yt tooke parte with Athanasius against his aduersaries, whē he was banished. How many councels helde the Arrians in the East against the trueth? The Emperor himselfe infected with the heresie: let the worlde iudge where the greater shewe of multitude was, with the Emperor, and with the councels; or with Athanasius and his fautors. Yea when Liberius Bishop of Rome in the West, had subscribed to the same heresie of the Arrians, &amp; Constantius after both his brethren were deade, ruled both in the East, and the West: what thinke you was the vaunting multitude of the Arrian faction, insulting against the true Christians, calling them heretikes, Homousians, Athanasians, &amp;c? Vincentius Lyrinensis saith: Arrianorum vene
                        •••
                      non iam portiunculam quandam, sed penè totum orbem contaminauerat, ade
                        •
                     ut prope cunctis latini sermonis episcopis, partim vi, partim fraude deceptis, caligo quaedam mentibus offunderetur: The poyson of the Arrians had defiled not nowe a little portion, but almost all the worlde, insomuch that almost all the Bishops of the Latine speach, partly by force, partly by fraude being deceiued, a certaine myst couered their minds. You see what skill this proude censor hath of the hystorie of that time.
               Last of all, he saith I make a proper distribution, the Popes of all ages, to be theirs, and yet the Apostles and doctors to be mine. But he maketh an vnproper application of the name of Popes to ye Bishops of Rome of al ages, where as a great number of the most auncient were godly men, and of true religion, members of the same Church wherof the Apostles and Doctors were, and not

antichristian tyrants, as the later sort of degenerated bishops haue shewed themselues to be.
               I doe not meane to prosecute euery trifling matter after this manner, but to let the reader see by these fewe what great pyth is in his marginall notes and friuolous quarels.
            
            
               CAP. III.
               
                  That he confesseth the foresaide true Church to haue made so playnely with vs, in verie many of the same controuersies of Bristowe. this time, that he is fayne to holde, that the true Church may erre, and also hath erred, but not his Caluinicall Church.
               
               I confesse indeede, that the Popish Church holdeth some errors, that were helde within the compasse of Fulke. 600. yeares, but them not verie many, nor the greatest controuersies, nor vniuersally helde in all that time, but in the later part of it onely, nor with such poyson of pernicious errors, as they are now holdē by the Papists.
               Also I confesse, that the true Church may erre, and hath erred, yea euen that Church whereof Caluin was a teacher, and that Caluin himselfe in some things both might erre and did erre, although Bristow like a scoffing parasite, doth except the same. But where he chargeth me to confesse, sometime, also the long continuing of the Church in incorruption, thereby to conuince me of contradiction: I answere, if he charge me with confessing the continuing of the Church in incorruption, for 600. yeares next after Christ, hee lyeth in his throat, I neuer confessed any such continuance: If I had affirmed that it continned after the first planting in incorruption for a long season, I might say without contradiction, that afterward it was corrupted with diuers errors, which I haue so proued, that Bristowe himselfe cannot deny them. But I must follow his sectiōs of this Chapter.
               
                  The first part that the true Church may erre. 
                  Bristowe.
               
               
                  
I confesse the true Church may erre. Fulke.
               
               
                  The seconde part that the true Church did also erre: and in the 
                  Bristowe. 
                  same poyntes as we doe nowe erre in. 1. Where he chargeth them with many pointes together.
               
               I confesse the true Church did also erre, and in some Fulke. of those pointes, that you nowe erre in, although they nothing so grosly as you. Those many abuses and corruptiōs which I confessed to haue entred into ye Church, immediatly after ye Apostles time, which the diuel planted as a preparatiue for Antichrist, I did not meane to bee many pointes of Poperie, and therefore are heere fraudulently foysted in, to vrge my confession, further then it stretcheth by my meaning. By Antichrist in deed I meane the Pope, as the chiefe head of that misshapen body, to whome I confesse, that the Arrian, Sabellian, Nestorian and al other old heresies, were a preparatiue, althogh, he directly acknowledge thē not, but hath his heresie, or rather apostasie, compacte of all errors, in that he is an aduersarie both to the person and office of our sauior Christ.
               Particular errors, that I confesse to haue beene taken of the Gentiles, or heretikes, he numbreth 8. The signe of the crosse, from the Valentinians: Oblations for the dayes of birth and death, from the Gentiles: prescripte times of fasting, &amp; immoderate extolling of sole life in the ministers of the Church, from the Montanistes, Manichees, Tacianistes: Prayer for the dead, of the Montanistes: purgatorie fier, from the Origenistes: Hierom almost condemning of seconde mariages, from Tertullian: The name of sacrifice, from the Gentiles: Also in the later writers, inuocation of sainctes, prayers for the dead, and diuerse superstitious and superfluous ceremonies, confessed by me to be maintained.
               2 As touching Vigilantius and inuocation of Sainctes by it 
                  Bristowe. 
                  selfe.
               
               I confesse that Ambrose, Augustine and Hierom Fulke.
                  
helde inuocation of Sainctes to bee lawfull, which is an error.
               3 As touching Iouinian of fasting, of Virginities merite, of 
                  Bristowe. 
                  Votaries Mariage.
               
               If Iouinian contemned Christian fastes, he erred, neyther Fulke. doe we take his part therein, nor yet in making mariage equall with virginitie, in all respectes. For the mariage of Votaries, Bristowe vrgeth me with no confession: but I charge him with a shameles falsification of my wordes, which he pretendeth to rehearse, as a great absurditie. Purg. 402. We neither boast vpon Augustine nor Ambrose, when they dissent from our doctrine: Neither are ashamed of Vigilantius nor Berengarius, when they agree therewith: But my wordes are these: Seeing God himselfe is the father of that doctrine, which wee haue receyued by his holy worde, we neither boast vppon Augustine nor Ambrose, when they dissent therefro: neither are ashamed of Vigilantius nor Berengarius, when they agree therewith.
               4 As touching Ceremonies. 
                  Bristowe.
               
               I confesse they had many superfluous Ceremonies, yea such as the Papistes them selues haue not, for the Fulke. most parte.
               5 As touching Purgatorie and prayer for the dead. 
                  Bristowe.
               
               I acknowledge, that prayer for the dead is an auncient Fulke. error, the opinion of purgatory in ye Latine church, is not so olde, by many hundred yeares: in the Greke Church, it was neuer receiued.
               
                  What he saith of particular Doctors, and their particular 
                  Bristowe. 
                  times for it.
               
               I say, that most of the particular Doctors, from the Fuke.
                  
time of Montanus, haue bene infected with the error of praying for the deade, but none to bee shewed before him. The time of the first Nicen Councell (Bristow saith) is inough for any Christian man. Who euer hearde such a blockish reason? If the Nicen Councel had decreed prayers for the dead to be vsed without the authoritie of the holy scriptures, it had not bene inough for any Christian man to beleeue. The Nicen Councel made the Bishop of Alexandria equal with the Bishop of Rome, which the Papistes will not allowe. cap. 6. The same councel decreed, that men should stand and not kneele in publike prayers, yet is no man bound to this decree, neither doe the Papistes themselues obserue it. Cap. 20. But my ignorance is noted of Bristow, for saying that superstition was riper in the Latine Church, where the seate of Antichrist was appointed to be set vp, not knowing that all the olde heresies, haue spronge of the Grekes: against whome were helde the first foure generall Councels. A pithie reason, shewing no lesse Logike then knowledge of the Churche storie. Foure heresies were condemned by foure councels, therefore all olde heresies sprong of the Grecians. But I will aske of Bristowe, whether Nouatus or Nouatianus captaine of the Nouatians, was of the Latine or Greeke Church? Iouinian &amp; Vigilantius are counted of him to be as great heretikes, as Arrius and Macedonius, but whence did they spring, out of Greece or frō the Latines? What shall I name the Donatistes, Pelagians, Celestians, Priscillianistes, al which sprange out of the Latine Church? And yet it is true, that Vincentius affirmeth, that vntill the dayes of Stephanus, ye Bishoppes of the Romaine Church, had alwayes earnestly defended the integritie of religion, once receiued, which he speaketh not as a singular prayse of that Church only, for he saith of the same matter immediately before, Exemplis talibus plena sunt omnia, All places are full of such examples. And that which Bristow citeth out of Ruffinus in exp. Symb, that no heresie did spring at Rome, is to be vnderstode onely of such heresies as he speaketh

of before, against the danger of which, some clauses were added to the creede: For otherwise, Ruffinus could not forget what hee him selfe had translated out of Eusebius lib. 6. cap. 33. of Nouatus, which being a Priest of the Church of Rome, was author of the heresie of the Nouatians.
               2 What he sayeth of the whole Church in some of those 
                  Bristowe. 
                  times.
               
               I say the practise of prayer for the dead is not generall, 
                     
                        •
                     Fulke. because it is not to be founde in the most auncient times. Bristow asketh, if nothing be generall, but that I finde: as though he could find any thing, for 200▪ yeares, but in Tertullian the Montanist. But the later practise for places he sayeth is generall: if I should vrge him to proue it, he could not do it. I confesse it was common, but for all the later time, it was not generall. The Waldenses, for 500. of the last yeares, practised it not, and almost in euery age, some are noted, which regarded it not, or denyed it.
               3. To what Origen he confesseth the doctors to referre it, to witte, vnto scripture and tradition of the fathers. 
                  Bristowe.
               
               I confesse, that some of the fathers referre the custom Fulke. of praying for the dead, to the Scriptures, and some to the tradition of the Apostles, but neither of both truely. Bristowe compareth the case with fasting, wherof Augustine sayeth, that it is euidently commaunded in scripture, but the dayes not prescribed: So is prayer for the dead, but the dayes, times, and particular prayers, are referred to the tradition. I aunswere, when we see as good scripture for prayer for the dead, as wee see for fasting, we will say the cases are like.
               How Tertullian denyed, prayer and oblation for the dead to be taken out of the scriptures, is referred to the ninth Chapter, where it shall be answered.
               But he is fayne to denye (sayeth Bristowe) the most certeine workes of the Apostles schollers, Clemens Romanus,

and Dionysius Areopagita, saying that we haue them of some counterfaiting knaue, &amp;c. (quoting for my saying) Pur. 268. which I desire the reader to peruse, and tell mee how honest a man he is, that chargeth a man to say of ye works of Clemens and Dionyse, that which I speake onely and expressely of the counterfeit epistles of Clemens. Concerning the change of the olde Liturgies: we shall heare more in the sixt Chapter.
               4 He contraiewise feareth not, nor basheth not to say, they 
                  Bristowe. 
                  had it from the diuell and his lymmes.
               
               I see no cause, why I should feare or bash to affirme, Fulke. that all errours came from the diuell, who is a lyer and the father of lyes: Neither is it any absurditie to saye, that the yerely oblations of thanksgiuing for the dead, are heathenish, as well as the oblations for the birthes. But it is an impudent slaunder, that he chargeth mine owne mouth to confesse, that the whore of Babylon is the church, at the farthest by S. Augustines time, which hath patched vp her purgatory, &amp; sacrifices for the dead: for purgatorie and sacrifice for the dead, was scarse hatched in S. Augustines time, when Augustine him selfe confessed it might be doubted, whether there be any such purging fire or no.
               5. As touching the Popes supremacy. 
                  Bristowe.
               
               Concerning the Popes primacy, he chargeth mee to teach, that the Church vanished quite away, vpon a souden, Fulke. when Phocas sold the primacie to Bonifacius, and yet no man then in the worlde, that went out from the Pope. The first point is a shamelesse slaunder, for I neuer taught that the church vanished quite away: the second is true, if it be rightly vnderstood: no man went from the Pope, as from a true member of the church, but the Pope rather went out of the church, into an antichristian tyrannie. But vnderstanding his saying to be, that no man departed from the Popes authoritie, it

is vtterly false: for notwithstanding the sale of Phocas, the Greeke church neuer yelded to his supremacie. The church of Rauenna in Italy, long time after withstoode his tyranny, and was separated from him, in causa autocephalias, that shee would haue no head ouer her, but he
                     •
                   owne bishop, as the histories affirme. Bristowe, to excuse the Pope for doing contrarie to Gregories reproofe of the bishop of Constantinople, sayeth, that he neuer vseth the style of vniuersall bishop, but of s
                        〈…〉
                      seruorum, the seruant of seruants, as though it was for the bare style, and vsurpation of the title, that Gregorie was so earnest, and not for the vniuersall authoririe, which was claimed by yt style, in which respect Gregory of humilitie, the rest of his successors of hypocrisie, called them selues, seruants of the seruants of God.
               Now at length Bristowe alledgeth three causes of this his tedious rehearsall of my sayings: first, that the reader may see, in how many points we dissēt frō them, whome we confesse to haue bene of the true church. I answer, so long as we agree in the foundation, we are all of one church. The second cause, that the reader may see, I confesse the Papistes to agree with them of the true church, in the same. A great glorie, that you agree with them in a fewe errors, and dissent in the most waightie matters of saluation. Thirdly, that I haue not, for these points, or any depēding of these, iust cause to denye the Papists the true church &amp;c. If you erred onely in these points, as they did, holding all other trueth, which those auncient fathers helde, wee woulde no more deny you to be members of the true church, than wee do them: but seeing beside these errors, you hold many blasphemous heresies, which they neuer helde, and vtterly deny the office of Christ, the foundation of our saluation, therefore wee iustly deny you to be of the true church of Christ. Neither is your excuse to be admitted, that you erre by authoritie of them, who if the trueth had bene as plainly reuealed vnto them, out of the scriptures, as it is to you, would neuer haue so obstinatly defended their errors, but as they alwayes

professed, yelded to the trueth, against custome, prescription of time, authoritie of councels, or any practise whatsoeuer.
            
            
               CAP. IIII.
               
                  That he chargeth the sayde primitiue true church, with sundry Bristowe. errors wherewith he neither doeth, nor will, nor can charge vs.
               
               I affirme that diuerse godly fathers of the primitiue Fulke. church, held sundry errors, which the Papists holde not at this daye. Also that the auncient church erred in som points and practise, wherewith I will not charge the popish church, except they charge them selues. But that I should confesse (as Bristowe sayeth) That there may be a company which erreth, not onely some principall members, but also the whole body of it, and which erreth obstinatly, and moreouer, which erreth the grossest errors that can be, &amp; them 
                        〈◊〉
                      no small number, and yet the same company may be the tru
                        •
                      church. This is vtterly false, I neuer made such confession, neither can Bristow bring any wordes of mine, that sound to the same effecte: and therefore I here charge him before God and the worlde, for a shamelesse lyer, and an vngodly slaunderer. As for the errors wherewith I charge either the auncient writers, or the auncient church of Rome, do followe afterward discussed in the sixth Chapter.
            
            
               CAP. V.
               
                  What reason he rendreth, why they in those auncient time
                        •
                     , Bristowe. had the true church notwithstanding these their errors.
               
               First repeating my confessions: That the true church 
                  Fulke. 
                  may erre, that it hath erred in some articles wherein we erre, &amp; in many other wherein we do not erre, wherof it followeth plainly (qd Bristowe) that neither our erring, nor these our errors, no nor any other our errors, are alone sufficient for him to depriue vs of the true church. Marke this consequens of Bristowe,

some errors which the Papistes, hold common with the olde church, cannot depriue them of the true church, ergo none other errors that they hold, contrary to the auncient church, are alone sufficient to depriue them. This is popish logike. And yet I will in this argument, charge his conscience rather then his science: for common sense abhorreth such reasoning, from the particular to the vniuersall.
               But let vs see, if such reason as alloweth the fathers to haue had the true church, notwithstanding their errors, may serue the Papistes to proue them the true church, their errors notwithstanding. The reason I alledge, that the fathers had the true church, is because they held the onely foundation Iesus Christ, and the article of iustification by the onely mercie of God. Now (sayth Bristowe) who knoweth not, that we beleeue in the onely sonne of God, and in the onely mercy of God, and that therefore wee looke not to be saued by our owne works, that is, which we did without him, in Paganisme, Iudaisme, or Caluinisme, in heresie or deadly sinne, &amp;c. but onely by his workes, that is, by his sacraments and the good deedes that of his great mercy, he hath created in vs in Christ Iesus? &amp;c. therefore the same reason serueth vs, notwithstanding our errors.
               I answere, your minor is false: you beleue not in the onely begotten sonne of God, because you beleue not in God. Cyprian de duplici Martyrio, sayeth: Non credit in Deum, qui non in eo solo collocat totius foelicitatis suae fiduciam: He beleueth not in God, which placeth not in him alone the trust of all his felicitie. You place not your trust in God alone, for you trust in your merites, yea, in the merites of others, both liuing and dead, and in an hundreth things beside God alone. Secondly, where you say, you beleeue in the onely mercy of God, it is false: for you beleeue no iustification by the only mercy and grace of God, which excludeth all workes and merites, as the Apostle sayeth, Rom. 11. Thirdly, you says you beleue to be saued by his sacraments, which in deede after a sort, are sayde to saue vs, namely, not as principal

                  
                     •
                  fficient causes, but as instruments and meanes that god 
                     •
                  seth to confirme his promises, which proceede of his onely grace and mercy. Fourthly you saye, you beleeue to be saued by those good deeds, that God of his mercy hath created in vs: which plainly declareth that you looke not to be saued, by the onely grace &amp; mercy of God, purchased by the redemption of Christ: but by such good workes as proceede from your selues, although you ascribe vnto the grace of God, that you be able to do them, as both the Pharisee did, which iustified him selfe by his owne workes, and yet acknowledged God to be the author of them, in him, Luk. 18. And the Pelagians also affirmed generally, that by Gods grace we are saued, because God of his grace hath giuen such a lawe, by keeping whereof, wee might attaine to saluation.
               But you cite S. Paul, Tit. 3. to shewe, that his mercie &amp; sacrament may stande together, which no man denyeth: yet can you not shewe, that his mercie is so tyed to his sacrament, that he saueth not without it. For Abraham was iustified by faith, before he was circumcised, and receiued circumcision as a seale of the faith he had, being vncircumcised: Rom. 4.
               And where the Apostle speaketh of workes generally, excluding them from being cause of our saluation, you restreine thē only to works done before baptisme: for this cursed glose you make vpon ye text, Not for any workes of * righteousness which we did (before baptisme say you) but for his mercie, hee hath saued vs by baptisme. But that S. Paul excludeth al maner of works, done by vs, from iustification, the sentence following declareth: That being iustified by his grace, we might be made heires according to the hope of eternall life. For grace and workes can neuer stande as a ioynt efficient cause, Rom. 11. but the one of necessitie, excludeth the other. As for the receiuing of the Sacramentes is no worke of ours, as you truely say, but an accepting of the grace, which God giueth. The place Ephes. 2. which you 
                     •
                  ite to proue, that we are saued by good workes, done

after baptisme, is cleane against you, if you had rehetsed the whole text. You are saued (saith S. Paul) by grace, through faith, (and this not of your selues, it is the gift of God) not of workes, least any man shoulde boast. For we are his workemanship, created in Christ Iesus vnto good works, which God hath prepared, that we should walke in them.
               The argument of S. Paul is taken out of the effect, Good workes are the effect and aide of our iustification, ergo not the efficient cause thereof. And marke againe, that hee saith we are saued by grace and not of workes. Marke also the reason why we are not saued by any workes done by man: namely least any shoulde boast. For boasting of man, is not excluded, so long as any workes that he doth, may be the cause of his saluation. For if Abraham be iustified by workes, hee hath whereof to boast, but not with God: Rom. 4. where is then boasting? It is excluded. By what lawe? of works? No, but by the lawe of faith. Wherefore not onely the workes done before baptisme, but all other are excluded from iustification, that no man should boast as the Pharisee, but that all glory of our saluation, might be ascribed wholy to God by Iesus Christ. You therefore building saluation vpon good workes, done after baptisme, doe manifestly builde vpon another foundation, then the onely true foundation Iesus Christ: and therefore, your errors notwithstanding, you cannot (as the olde fathers erring in small matters) be yet the church of God. What Flaccius Illyricus an intemperate man iudged of S. Hierom, I haue not to aunswere for him.
            
            
               CAP. VI.
               
                  An aunswere first to all the foresaide errors, wherewith he Bristowe hath charged the Church of the first 600. yeares: and afterwarde like

               Hetherto we had nothing in a manner, but a rehersall Fulke.
                  
of such matters as hee affirmeth to be confessed by me, nowe he promiseth to proue, that notwithstanding any thing I obiecte, the Church hath neuer erred, and moreouer, that it can neuer erre. How well he performeth his promise, we shall see by considering his aunsweres and arguments.
               
                  Fulkes zeale in aunswering for Caluin, and others being in

               First he chargeth me to holde, that our Church at Fulke. this present, doth not erre, and that I neuer say so much, as plainely, that it may erre. In deede I am throughly perswaded, that our Church in matters necessary to saluation, doth not erre. But when I say plainely, that not onely euery particular Church, but euen the whole Catholike Church on earth of euery age, may erre in matters not necessarie to saluation, what an impudent creature is this, to affirme, that I neuer say plainely, that our Church may erre? He that saith plainly, euery man 
                     ••
                   a lyer, doth he not say plainely that both Fulke and Bristowe are lyers? But my zeale for Caluin is wonderfull great, in his opinion, for I say he erreth not, but the fathers, and the whole Church haue erred. A man were as good to reason with a poste, as with such a sensles Papist: I say Caluin erreth not in such pointes, as hee is slaundered of by Allen, therefore I say he erreth not at al. I say and crie out as loude as I can, euery man erreth: and yet in Bristowes eares I say Caluin erreth not. The like zeale I shewe for Maister Iewel, whose learned labours I commende to the iudgement of the world. And yet he hath quit himselfe so well (saith Bristowe) that the very reading of his aunswere, hath turned many earnest Protestants, into earnest Catholikes, as both by the numbers, and by the noblenesse of the persons is notoriously knowne. I thinke the number and the nobilitie of the conuerts is all alike. There runneth such a tale of Copley, the great barron of Haie, created by the Spanish, I wot not howe, Lorde of the Maze, an auncient rotten house in Southwarke,

that he shoulde be so conuerted, if some popish treason discouered caused him not to faine such a souden and straunge conuersion. But yet Bristowe cannot abide, that I should exhort English papists, to reade that booke, and pray to God for direction in the trueth. No sir (saith he) that is not the way to trueth, no more then to swallowe poyson and pray, is the way to get or keepe health of bodie. Alas poore Bristowe, hast thou so soone forgot, yt which thou saidst immediatly before, that Iewels booke is such a soueraigne antidote, that hath expelled the poyson of Protestants from so many and so noble personages, and made them so earnest Catholikes, that thou nowe wouldest haue them fly from it, as from a poyson? We see thy wittie pollicie, it is not the way to trueth (thou sayest) to reade our aunsweres: but it is the way to continue mē in error, to suffer them to see nothing but that you say your selues. A sure way to winne credit, but yet with fooles onely: For hee that dare not let his aduersaries aunswere bee seene, sheweth plainely that hee dare not abide the tryall, but requireth all men to beleeue him vppon his bare worde. Where you say, I should rather exhort men to reade ye auncient writers, I aunswere, that is needelesse, for such whom I exhort to reade maister Iewels replie, namely such as cannot wade well out of these controuersies without such conference, as they may see betweene maister Harding, and maister Iewell.
               
                  
                     The first part concerning the errors that he layd (ap. 3. par. 2.) both to the fathers, and to vs, and first of the crosse and images. 
                     Bristowe.
                  
                  First, where I charge them, that the estimation of the signe or figure of the crosse was taken of the Valentinians, Fulke. that the reader may wonder at my audacitie, he saith, Irenaeus nor Epiphanius speake not a worde of the figure, nor signe, nor vse of the crosse, but tell that those heretikes inuented 30. gods called Aeones, and in them two or 3. Christes, and one of the Christs, they called Crux, &amp;c. what say you Bristowe, speake they not a

worde, either of the figure, signe, or vse of the crosse? I coulde referre you to the 14. Chapter of Irenaeus, where he telleth that they call the Zodiak (whose mouing is ouerthwart the first mouing of heauen) an image of the crosse. And when they both tell you, that the crosse among the Valentinians, had a double vse of confirmation and separation, speake they not a worde of the vse of the crosse? No (say you) they inuented 30 gods called Aeones, and among them diuerse Christs, wherof the crosse was one. It is a shame to lye on the diuell. The Valentinians did not call their Aeones goddes, but emissions of the first great inuisible &amp; infinite Acone. Neither was the crosse, any of those 30. Aeones, ages, or worldes. For they are all thirtie named in Irenaeus, before he cometh to the crosse: videlicet 8. of the first emission, tenne of the seconde; and twelue of the thirde. Neither did they call the crosse Christ, but the vertue of Christ, confirmatiue &amp; separatiue, such as healed ye woman of the bloudie issue. Vnto which they gaue diuerse names, calling it in a manner as you papists doe, the redeemer, the sauior, the sanctifier, the apoynter of the bounds, the bringer vnto further matters, the most perfect ende or termination, &amp;c. But all this while, you wil say there is no mention of the figure of the crosse, but of a fained mysterie or imagination. Then you must vnderstand, that of these imagined mysteries, they affirmed there were sensible and materiall thinges in the world, made to be similitudes and images: Irenaeus. lib. 2. cap. 6. Such was the crosse yt Christ suffered vpon, and all other crosses made to the similitude of it, of which S. Paul by their fantasie shoulde say, God forbidde that I should reioyce but in the crosse of Christ, &amp;c. whose figures that they vsed in their consecration and baptizing, it may appeare in Iren. lib. 1. cap. 18. where although the figure of the crosse be not named, yet their termes of redemption, confirmation &amp; diuision which they vsed, in powring on of water, annoynting them, doe infinyate, that they vsed some signes of the crosse to whome they gaue those titles, as before is shewed. Finally when it is certein

by Iren. lib. 2. cap. 6. that they affirmed those similitudes and images in materiall thinges, were made vnto the honour of their inuisible and spirituall phantasies, there is no doubt but they had in great price the materiall image or signe of the crosse, for reuerence of that high mysterie whereof they dreamed the same to be an image or similitude.
                  Concerning the images of Iesus, which the Carpocratians and other like heretikes made, and worshipped, Bristow sayth, it toucheth not the papistes, because they also made and worshipped the images of heathen Philosophers, like as the Samaritans ioyned the worshipping of false Gods, with the worshipping of our Lorde. If I shoulde obiect vnto you, the worshipping of the images of saint Sonday, saint Hardhuffe, saint Vncomber, yea saint Christopher, and saint George on horseback, which al were meere Idolls after your owne diffinition of Idols, I wote not howe you coulde quite your selfe, from the case of the Samaritanes. But Irenaeus and Epiphanius charge the heretikes, not onely for ioyning the images of Philosophers and Poets with the Image of Iesus, but also for fayning the Image of Iesus, and worshipping it. Irenaeus againste Basilides lib. 1. cap. 23. saith absolutly, Viuntur autem &amp; imaginibus &amp; incātationibus, &amp; invocationibus &amp;c. They vse images, and inchauntmentes, &amp; inuocations and all the rest of superstitions. Here he placeth the vse of images with inchauntementes, inuocation of spirites, and other superstitions of magike, and chapter 24. against the Gnostikes and Carpocratians he saith, 
                        Etiam imagines quasdam &amp;c. Also they haue certayne images painted, and some made of other matter, saying that the forme of Christ was made by Pilate, in yt time which Iesus was with men. If it had not beene a faulte to haue had these counterfete images, Irenaeus woulde not haue ioyned it amonge other hereticall practises of the Carpocratians. The like sayth Epiphanius against Basilides and the Gnostikes, 
                        
                           Haere. 24 Habent imagines &amp;c. They haue images paynted in coulers, some also haue them of

golde and siluer and other matter, which they say, are the images of Iesus, and that these images of Iesus were made vnder Pontius Pilate, when he was conuersant amongest men. And these images they haue closely. Moreouer they haue the images of certaine Philosophers &amp;c. Who seeth not by this context, that Epiphanius accompted it hereticall, to haue such images in any vse of religion, although they had not made any other images of philosophers besides? Also against the Collyridians, which with certayne cakes offering as the Papistes doe candles, worshipped the image of the virgin Marie: he asketh, what this desire of making images can be, else, but a deuilish enterprise? yet the Collyridians worshipped no heathen Philosophers with the virgin Marie. Neither doeth hee simply charge them that they worshipped her, as a God, but 
                        siue velut ipsam, &amp;c. Whether these foolish women offer this cake to her, as worshipping Marie her selfe: or whether they go about to offer the saide stincking offering for her, the whole matter is folishe and straunge, and a fraude and deceite of the motion of diuelles. Therefore that I extende my speech no longer, let that which hath beene sayde, suffice. Let Marie be in honor, let the Lord be worshipped. And what thinke you, woulde he haue iudged of the pilgrimage and offering of men and women, to the images of the virgin Marie, which coulde not abyde to see a vaile in which was painted the image of Christ, or some sainct, hanging in a Church of Christians, but rent it in peeces, at Anablatha? Epiph. Epist. ad Ioan, Hieron. But for the defence of Images: Bristowe referreth the reader to Sanders booke of Images: and I likewise to my confutation of the same. In the meane time, it is a small matter, that Bristowe vrgeth my confession, that crossing at euery step, (which is, saith he, a making and great religion of Images) is referred by Tertullian vnto tradition of the Apostles, seeing that is shewed to haue a later and corrupter beginning, and other fables beside by Tertullian referred to Apostolike tradition.
               
               
                  
                  2 Of inuocation of sainctes, and worshipping of their reliques. 
                     Bristowe.
                  
                  You remember since the 3. chapter (sayth Bristow) by your owne report that the true Church counted Vigilantius Fulke. an heretike for denying the inuocation of Sainctes, and the worshipping of their reliques. I aunswere, yt I remember no such matter, neither do I finde any where, that Vigilantius was publikely condemned for an heretike, in his time, but onely in the priuate iudgement of Hierome, although Bernardus long after account him litle better. But of worshipping the reliques of Sainctes, and of their images, the case (say you) is all one: then by Hieromes iudgement, neither of both is to be worshipped. For wee worship not, sayth he, the reliques of Martyrs, no nor the sunne and Moone, no not Angelles and Archangels, Cherubim and Seraphim &amp;c: But we honor the reliques of the martyrs, that wee may worshippe him whose witnesses the martyrs are. By which saying, and other to the same effecte, it is manifest, that although Hierome defended some honoring, or moderat reuerēce of reliques, yet he abhorred idolatrous worshipping of them, and much more of their images. Where I say, the superstition of reliques is receiued of the Ossenes: Bristowe sayth it perteyneth not to them, because the Ossenes worshipped them for Gods, whose reliques they had in such, estimation. But that is false: for they helde Marthys and Marthana for Sainctes, proceeding out of the holy seed of Elxai whom they neuer worshipped, but as a great Prophet and teacher, although Epiphanius saith pro diis adorabantur, they were worshipped as Gods: meaning that worship which is proper vnto God onely, was giuen to them, as it is of Papistes vnto sainctes, whome they worship as God, geuing that worshipp vnto them, which is proper onely vnto God, as faith &amp; inuocation. But Bristow would haue the snottie cloutes of Thomas Becket, that were worshipped after his death, to bee all

one with the napkins and partletts, that were caried frō the bodie of S. Paul the Apostle to cast out vncleane spirites, when hee liued: which napkins and partletts, yet he cannot proue either, that they were euer worshipped, or that they were reserued for reliques, after the worke of miracles was wrought by them. As for the argument that Chrysostome taketh, against the Pagans, of the reliques of Babylas the Martyr, which he would haue me to applie to my disease, was to the confusion of Idolatrie and sorcerie, not to the setting vp or mainteyning thereof. And what worshippe I pray you, was giuen to the reliques of Babylas? If God shewed miracles by the presence of his bodie in Daphne, as by the bones of Elizeus, yet it followeth not, that his body or ashes, were worshipped more then the bones of Elizeus were.
                  Concerning inuocation of Angels, which they haue common with the Caianes, Bristowe sheweth, that the Caianes had other greater heresies, which the papistes holde not, as though those greater errors coulde excuse this lesser.
                  The superstition of Angels, that Saint Paul warneth the Ephesians, and Collossians to beware of, hee sayth, they be cleare of it, because in all their prayers, they conclude per Christum &amp;c. Through Christ our Lorde: as though they that taught the superstition of Angels, did cleane exclude Christ, or that it was to be doubted, lest the Ephesians and Collosians, would forsake Christ, and cleaue to Angels, but rather lest with the religion of Christ, as the cheefe, they woulde also admitte the superstition of the Angels, whereof were named the sect Angelici in Angelorum cultu inclinati, bowed downe in ye worship of Angels as S. Augustine saith, which therefore helde not the heade, because they worshipped not him alone, but ioyned Angels in part of his glorie. That Angels are ministring spirits, it proueth not, that therefore they must be prayed vnto, but the contrarie, for inuocation is due onely to him on whome wee beleeue, which is God onely. So much the more blasphemous

is Bristowe, that chargeth Saint Iohn, Apoc. 1. to haue prayed to the Angels, where he sayth, Grace and peace bee to you from him, that is, and was, and is to come: and from the 7. spirites, that are before his throne, and from Iesus Christ. Whereas the consent of all auncient writers is, that the seuen spirites are taken for the holy Ghost, which is seuen folde in his graces, according to the prophecie of Isay 11. The spirite of the Lorde shall rest vppon him, the spirite of wisedome and vnderstanding, the spirite of counsell and power, &amp;c. And it is also euident, that S. Iohn speaketh of the spirit of God as he was shewed to him in the vision, according to the dispensation of his manifolde giftes in the figure of the seuen lampes which are the 7. spirites of God according to the number of seuen Churches of Asia, to whome he sendeth the copie of his reuelation, for the instruction of all Churches in the worlde. Apoc. 4. And albeit wee shoulde expounde these seuen spirites for seuen Angels, as some late writers do, yet it followeth not, that S. Iohn shoulde pray vnto them, in those wordes, but rather to God for their ministerie to the preseruation of the Churches: No more then if he shoulde wishe grace vnto them from heauen, it followeth that he prayeth vnto heauen. That phrase is often in the Psalmes, wherein saluation or helpe is prayed to bee sent from Sion, from the holy Hill, from the Temple, from heauen: and yet no man was so madde to say, that prayers was made to Sion, to the Hill, to the Temple, to heauen. And yet it is more monstrous, that hee chargeth me to forget, that in the same booke of the Apocalips, God doeth promise to make the obstinate Iewes to come, and to adore before the feete of one Angell. And they shall know that I haue loued thee &amp;c. I speak vnto thee Th. Stapleton which profesiest that thou hast perused this booke of Bristowes and allowed it. Wast thou awake when thou didest p
                        •
                     ruse this argument, and allowed it? Tell me by thy credite, is this the Angell of the Church of Philadelphia, of whome this is writen to bee vnderstood, for one of those heauenly spirites concerning whose

worshippe and inuocation we nowe speake in this controuersie? Are epistles then written from the Apostle on earth to Angels in heauen? is any of those Angels neither whote nor colde in the seruice of God? hath any of them a name that he liueth and is deade? hath any of them left his first loue? doth any of them suffer the woman Iesabell to preach &amp;c? Out vpon thine impudence, if thou affirme all this, and fie vpon thy negligence, if thou didest peruse it and allow this argument, if thou be ashamed to affirme all the rest. As for thee Bristowe, it shall be sufficient to heare thy Master reproued for thy fault at this time, to make the blushe if any sparke of honest shame bee lefte in thy breast, that darest set abroad such an intollerable corruption of ye holy scripture, against all wit and reason that euer was hearde of.
               
               
                  3 Of abstinence from fleshmeate, and from marriage. 
                     Bristowe.
                  
                  Bristow would haue the question of prescript fasting Fulke. dayes and abstinence from flesh to be all one, as they are accompted among the Papistes. But there is great difference. For Aerius which denyed fasting dayes appointed by the church to be obserued, did neuerthelesse as Augustine sheweth out of Philaster, teach abstinence from flesh. Wherefore Bristowe falsely chargeth me to confesse, that the Papists haue the error of abstinence from flesh on fasting dayes, common with the auncient fathers of the primitiue churche. For on their prescript fasting dayes (except for necessitie) they did eate neither fish nor flesh, nor any thing vntill the euening. As for the abstinence from meates, against which Iouinian did teach, was but such particular abstinence as some men prescribed to them selues, not onely from fleshe, but also from fish and wine also, as appeareth by Hieronyme, 
                        
                           con. Iouin. lib. 2. Nec hoc dicinius quòd negemus pisces, &amp;c. Neither say we this (sayth Hieronyme) that we deny fishes and the rest of meates, if a mans will may be taken in meate, but as wee preferre virginitie before

marriage, so fasting and the spirite, before fulnesse &amp; flesh. Likewise, in diuers places, he speaketh of the abstinence from wine. Furthermore, he chargeth me to bring no proofe of that I say, the fathers tooke prescript times of fasting and vnmeasurable extolling of sole life in the clergie, from the Tatianistes, Manichees; &amp; Montanistes. If I brought no proofe in that place, it was because I presupposed that Allen knewe, what Eusebius reporteth out of Apollonius, lib. 5. Cap. 18. That Montanus was the first that prescribed lawes of fasting. And that the Manichees in their electes, and the Tatianistes in their perfectes, allowed not marriage, out of Epiphanius &amp; Augustine. But where I charge the Papistes which Aerianisme for abstinence from flesh, Bristowe sayeth, I take Richard for Robert, because the Aerians abstained from fleshe, as the Manichees, Tatianistes, &amp; Montanistes, as perteining to the yll god, according to the heresie of the Valentinians. Admit it were so, yet how cā either Richard or Robert dischardg them selues of the doctrine of diuels and spirite of errour, whose fruite is forbidding of marrying &amp; eating of meates, 1. Tim. 4. which is hereticall and abhominable, for what cause of religion so euer it be? And seeing the Apostle chargeth them with hypocrisie, it is more probable that he speaketh against ye Papists, than against those open blasphemers. But howe proueth Bristowe, that the Aerians were of the opinion of the Eucratites or Apotastites? Forsooth, because Augustine sayeth: 
                        Quidam perhibent istos sicut Eucratitas vel Apotastitas, non admittere ad communionem suam nisi continentes, &amp; eos qui seculo ita renuntiaverint, vt propria nulla possideant, ab es
                              •
                           a tamen carnium non eos abstinere dicit Epiphanius: Philaster verò &amp; hanc eis tribuit abstinentiam: Some say, that these men as the Eucratites or Apotastites do not admit into their societie, but onely such as conteine from marriage, and haue so renounced the world, that they possesse no proper goods, yet Epiphanius sayeth not, that they abstain from eating of flesh: but Philaster layeth to them also this abstinence.
                  
                  
                     
The similitude (which Bristowe by falsifying S. Augustine and displacing his wordes) would haue to be in the whole sect of the Eucratites, is onely in the abstinence from marriage and meates, and possessions, not in the opinion or cause for which they abstained. For seeing Aerius was an Arrian, he could not hold the pluralitie of Gods. For the Arrians so held the vnitie of the godhead, that they denyed the Trinitie of the persons in equall substance. And although he were the scholer of Eustachius, yet it followeth not yt he held all pointes as his maister did. Augustine chargeth him to haue added these matters of his owne. Beside that, diuerse of Eustachius articles differ little from the opinion of the Papists, concerning the marriage of priestes, and the abstinence from meates, howsoeuer the papistes will not seeme to be so boysterous as Eustachius in denying the kingdome of heauen to them that marry, and hope to them that eate fleshe: yet Pope Syricius is affirmed to write, that they which be marryed be in the flesh, and cannot please God: Ep. ad Him. Tarrat. And what a daungerous matter the Papistes count it, to eate flesh in tymes by them prohibited, all the world doth know.
               
               
                  4 Of Ceremonies, and Liturgies. 
                     Bristowe.
                  
                  The church is S. Augustines times approued vnprofitable Fulke. and hurtfull vsages, because Augustine complaineth of them Ep. ad Ianuar. 118. and wisheth, that they might be abrogated so soone as occasion serued. Bristowe quarreling, that my quotation is missing which was but the printers omission: answereth that Augustine in the same epistle sayeth, 
                        Tamen ecclesia, &amp;c. Yet the church of God approueth not any thing that is against the faith, or against good life. And I reply notwithstanding, yt they may be vnprofitable and hurtfull vsages. For so the same Augustine writeth in thesame Epistle. 
                        Quamuis enim, &amp;c. For although neither this can be founde, howe they are against the faith, yet they oppresse the religion it selfe with seruile burdens, which

the mercie of God would haue to be free with moste fewe and manifest sacraments of celebrations, so that the condition of the Iewes is more tollerable, which although they haue not knowen the time of libertie, yet they are subiect to lawfull burthens, &amp; not to humaine presumptions. But Bristowe proceedeth and vrgeth an other saying of Augustine, that if the whole church vse any thing, it is a point of most insolent madnesse to call in question, whether that should be so vsed. I answere, wee speake of approuing of vsages, not of any thing that is generally vsed. The church is S. Augustines time, approued diuerse vnprofitable vsages by secrete consent, without open abrogation, which yet were diuerse in diuerse places.
                  Where I proue they were vnprofitable by this reason, that many of them are abrogated, he answereth, that is no good argument, for there might be good cause to abrogate them, although they came of the tradition of the Apostles: as ye decree of not eating blood nor strangled, Act. 15. and the custome of the Apostles and of the churches of God for men to praye and prophesie bareheaded. To the former decree I reply, that it was temporall, and not meant by the makers to be eternall, but to beare with the infirmitie of the Iewes for a time. To the other custome of praying or preaching bareheaded, whatsoeuer the pompous doctors of the popish church obserue, I saye it is perpetually to be obserued for the distinction of the man and woman in couering and vncouering of the head, and the obseruing of naturall comlinesse in both, although for necessitie of health a nightcap, kercheffe or such like couering, according to the custome of the country, be not absolutely prohibited. As for ye forbidding of solemne fastes and genuflections on sundayes, which Bristowe sayeth was ordeined by the Apostles to plant the article of the resurrection, and more straitly obserued of the church against the Manichees, which might be abrogated, nowe that article is receiued and the heresie extinct is but a dreame of his owne head without proofe, &amp; so

                     
                        〈…〉
                     et it passe, although I knowe not what he meaneth to say, that forbidding of solemne kneeling is still obserued: for the papistes kneele as solemnely on sundayes as on other dayes. As for the libertie the church hath in altering of ceremonies, is neuer denied of me: but fondly alledged of him, which pretendeth that traditions of the Apostles are as necessarily to be obserued, as commaundements of the scripture, referring euery blynde ceremonie, whereof he knoweth none author, to tradition of the Apostles.
                  Nowe concerning the Liturgies, he sayth, Proclus answereth why Basil &amp; Chrysostome changed the auncient Liturgies that were before them: he sayth, forsooth they did but abridge and make shorter the Liturgie of S. Iames, which was too lōg for the peoples cold deuotion. But his reason will soone proue all the three Liturgies that nowe are called by the names of S. Iames, Basil, and Chrysostome, to be counterfeits, for ther is small difference in the length of them, and in a manner none at all. As for the Councell of Constantinople in Trullo, doth in deede name the Lyturgies of S. Iames, Basil, &amp; Chrysostome, but that proueth not these which we haue at this day, to be the same, seeing there are manifest arguments to the contrary, as of the Monasteries spoken of in that which goeth vnder the name of Iames and of Alexius the Emperour, &amp; Nicholas the bishop, in Chrysostome, which were not borne many hundreth yeares after his death. But that prayers for the dead, were vsed in ye ancient Liturgies, that were before Chrysostomes tyme, Bristowe sayeth he hath proued by plaine demonstration, Cap. 3. where there is nothing but a saying of Chrysostome cited by me, 
                        
                           in Epist. ad Philip. Hom. 3 Non frustra, &amp;c.
                         It hath not been in vaine decreed by the Apostles, that in the celebration of the holy mysteries, memorie should be made of them that are hence departed, &amp;c. This saying proueth a remembrance, but not a prayer, neuerthelesse of this remembrance vsed in the elder times, they gathered prayers to be profitable. But more clearely, that it was a remembrance

without prayers, it appeareth by Epiphanius, which interpreteth the same remembrance to be as a prayer for the sinners, and for the righteous of all sortes to be a distinction of them from our sauiour Christ, cont. Aer. ser. 75.
                  
               
               
                  5 Of sacrifice: and for the deade. 
                     Bristowe.
                  
                  The name of sacrifice, which the fathers vsed commō
                     ly for the celebration of the Lords supper, they tooke of Fulke. the Gentiles, you might adde and of the Iewes also, for that somewhere I doe affirme. But howe proue you, they had it of the scriptures? Because Christ saide not this is I, that was borne of the virgin, but this is my body, this is my bloude. The Apostle saith not of him that eateth vnworthely, that he is guiltie of Christ, but he is guilty of the bodie and bloude of Christ. Why Bristowe, doest thou dreame? we speake of the name of sacrifice, whether it bee vsed in scripture for the celebration of the Lordes supper. But if I knewe (saith he) what is the sacrifice of a liue thing, I shoulde see that Christ is heere as properly sacrificed in a mysticall manner, as he was properly sacrificed on the crosse in an open manner. Syr I knowe what S. Paul meaneth, when hee exhorteth vs to offer vp our bodies a liuing sacrifice, Rom 12. &amp; yet I am neuer the neere to vnderstand, your mystical sacrifice of a very bodie, vnder the mysterie of shape and colour of breade.
                  Also as blinde as you make me, I see the Altar, Heb. 13. of which it is not lawful for the Iewes to eate, so long as they remaine in Iudaisme, but that sacrifice is the death of Christ, whereof none that continue in obseruation of the Leuiticall Lawe can be partakers. As for the table of the Lorde, and the table of diuels, in one forme of speach, 1. Cor. 10. proueth no sacrifice of the Lordes table, opposite to the sacrifice of the Gentils, but the feast of the Lordes table, contrarie to the feast of the idoll offerings, whereof the controuersie was, and not of communicating with the sacrifices of the Gentils. For if hee

had ment of the sacrifices of both, he woulde haue na

                        u, that the opinion of Purgatorie after this life came first from the hethen philosophers as most notable heresies did, seing all philosophers that graunted the immortalitie of the soule, as Pythagoras, Empedocles, and Plato, assigned three places for the soules departed, Heauen, hell, and a thirde place of purifying. This argument (saith Bristowe) proueth as wel, that heauen, hel, &amp; 
                        •
                     he immortalitie of the soule, had their originall of the

                     re founde in the scriptures, which are before all philosophers, but of the thirde place of purifying, we may say as Augustine doth, contra Pelag. hypognost. lib. 5. Tertium pe
                        
                           •
                        itus ignoramus. The thirde place we know not at al, neither doe we finde it in the holy scriptures. But if I would reporte the trueth (Bristowe saith) there is no worde of any thirde place of purifying, but that those philosophers, made onely two sorts of receptacles. But if I find three and the third a place of purifying, what shall we thinke of Bristowes trueth? First hee graunteth supernas mansiones, the high mansions for the soules of the Philosophers and wise men onely: secondly Inferos, hell, or the lowe places, whereof Tertulian saith 
                        Reliquas animas ad inferos deijciunt, the rest of the soules they cast downe into hell: 3. What say you Bristowe, al the soules except Philosophers soules? Could you not see betweene them, imprudentes animas, the foolish soules, remayning (according

to the Stoikes) about the earth, which shoulde bee instructed of the wise soules. What was this, but a third place, and a place of purifying? But if you woulde haue your purgatorie more plainely described, you may resort to Virgil, Aeneid. 6. where Anchises out of the opinion of Pythagoras, rehearseth howe the soules of good men are purged: 
                        Quin &amp; supremo cum lumine vita reliquit, &amp;c. After this life hath left them (saith he) yet is not all euill, nor all the infections of the bodie departed frō them, and it is necessarie that such things as haue beene long gathered together, shoulde by meruailous meanes be done away. Therefore they are exercised with paines, and suffer the punishment of their auncient euills: some soules, are hanged vp against the voyde windes, to some their sinne remayning, is washed away vnder great raging waters, or burned vp with fire. Euery one of vs suffer our punishments, and then being but fewe wee are sent into the ioyfull Elysian fieldes &amp;c.
                  Nowe concerning the three kindes of Purgatorie, which I saide that Carpocrates the heretike inuented, &amp; proued by the payment of the vttermost farthing, as the papists doe theirs: Bristow saith, by this argument, I wil winne much honestie, bicause the purgatorie that Carpocrates inuented, was a wallowing in all sinfull operation &amp;c. What is that to mine honestie? I saide he inuented a kinde of purgatorie, and Bristowe saith it was an absurde kinde of purgatorie. I said he proued his purgatorie as the papists doe theirs, but to that Bristowe aunswereth neuer a worde. But this is small honestie, for Bristow, that such things as are ioyned together by me, to shewe by what degrees popishe purgatorie came to perfection, they are seuered by him, as though I ment to charge the Papistes by such argumentes, to confute their purgatorie.
               
               
                  Purgatorie fire.
                  I said that purgatorie fire was taken of the Originists. For Origen brought in the purging fire by better reason

out of 1. Cor. 3. for all soules, then the papistes doe

                        •
                     f which, they gathered the purging of some soules. That I say of Origen, although Bristowe confesse it to 
                        〈…〉
                     e true in effect, yet he saith I speake it without proofe. My proofe is in 
                        Psal. 36. Ho. 3. 
                        Si verò in hac vita contem

But if in this life we contemne ye words of the diuine scripture admonishing vs, and will not be healed or reformed by the reprehensions thereof, it is certaine that fire abideth vs which is prepared for sinners, and we shal come vnto yt fire, in which of what sort euery mans work is, ye fire shall trie. And (as I thinke) it is of necessitie that wee must all come vnto that fire. Although one be Paul or Peter, yet he commeth to yt fire. But they that are such do heare. Although thou passe through fire, ye flame

                        st howe euery man that departeth out of the battel of this life, hath neede of purification, &amp;c. yet saith Bristow, that of the purgation of such as die in gods fauour, there is no word, which although he speak of Augustin whose wordes he citeth Ad quod vult. Hae. 43. yet he saith vntruely, for thus he writeth in the same place: 
                        Sunt &amp; alia, &amp;c. There be other opinions of this Origen which the Catholike Church doth not receiue at all, in which it doth not falsely accuse him, neither can be so excused by his defenders especially: cōcerning purgation &amp; deliuerāce: and againe after long time the reuolution vnto ye same euils of euery reasonable creature. I suppose he yt speaketh of the purgation of euery reasonable creature, speaketh of the purgation of such as die in Gods fauour also, wherefore it is manifest, that Origen erred not only about hell &amp; heauen, and the purgation of the damned,

but also about the purgation of such as dye in Gods fauour. Therefore Bristowe neede not gather mine argument, as he doth in scorne. There is no such Purgatorie as Origen &amp; Carpocrates would haue, therefore there is no purgatorie at all. But what should Carpocrates come in this title? but for a sorie sophisme, whē we speake of Origen onely. Wherefore if you wil giue mee leaue to frame mine argument (although I meant not an argument out of Origens purging fire onely) it should be thus: There is no such purging fire as Origen would for them that dye in Gods fauour: such as Origens fire, is the fire that the papistes would haue: therefore there is no such purging fire as the Papists woulde haue.
               
               
                  Releeuing of the dead by prayer.
                  If the dead be not releeued, we say (quod Bristowe as S. Paul saith) they must indure a fierie and therefore a most painefull purgation. And for this saying, hee quoteth most impudently 1. Cor. 3. But I pray you Bristowe, where saith S. Paul the deade must endure a fierie purgation, or where maketh he any exception of their releeuing? Hee saith the fire shall trie euery mans worke. Is euery man onely some kinde of deade men? or is euerie mans worke the man him selfe? or is the triall of euerie mans worke of what sort it is, a purgation either of the man or of the worke? Arte thou not ashamed to charge S. Paul to say that, whereof hee saith nothing at all? euen by the iudgement of S. Augustine. But that Aerius was not the first that denyed prayers for the dead to be profitable, I shewed by that of the most auncient writers. The Heracleonits among other their heresies were charged to burye their dead wt inuocations, and to redeem them with oyle, balme and water, and inuocations said ouer their heades, as Augustine and Epiphanius shewe out of Irenaeus. Nowe commeth Bristowe, and in many needelesse words, rehearseth other partes of their heresie, with their manner of

seasoning or receiuing those that beleeue in them, by a counterfait marriage and baptisme, and by anoynting with balme, &amp;c. concluding that this practise of theirs, maketh as much against true baptisme &amp; solemnizing of matrimony as against prayer for the dead, anealing, or anoynting, &amp;c. Likewise might they conclude, that all their ceremonies are as good as baptisme and marriage. But whatsoeuer wee reade of the practise of heretikes, we must learne to distinguish that which is their owne inuention, from that which is the ordinance of God. And how shall wee knowe Gods ordinance from heretikes inuention, but by the holy scriptures? Separating therefore baptisme and marrying, which are the ordinance of God contained in the scriptures, from the rest that haue no ground in the same, prayers for the dead which they vsed with such like matters, were the inuention of heretikes. Howbeit (saith Bristowe) of prayer for the dead in all this was neuer a worde. No was? Howe read you Irenaeus lib. Cap. 18. out of which you cite so much &amp; could not see, that after he hath spoken of their seasoning of their disciples aliue, he telleth how they redeeme them when they are dead: 
                        Alij sunt qui mortuis redimunt, &amp;c. Other there be, that redeeme the dead at the end of their departing, powring on their heads oyle &amp; water, or the foresaid oyntment, with water, and with the foresaid inuocations &amp;c? Do you not heare the same prayers sayde by the heretikes for the dead, which they vttered before for the liuing?
                  But if the Heracleonites should faile mee, I affirme that Montanus had in all pointes the opinion of ye Papistes, because Tertullian a Montanist vttereth al those pointes in such bookes as he made being a Montanist, and especially in his booke de anima. That Terrullian vttereth the opinion of the Papistes in all pointes, Bristow wil not denye: But he asketh, whether all be Montanisme that Tertullian hath in that his booke de anima, and in so many other bookes as he wrote being a Montanist? No forsooth sir. But Montanus the heretike helde whatsoeuer he wrote in those bookes. Howe

then shall we discerne that which is proper to Montanus, from that which he hath common with the catholike church? I deliuered a rule euen nowe, concerning the practise of the Heracleonites. Prayer for the dead and Purgatorie are not found in the holy Scriptures, but they are found in a disciple of Montanus, therfore they stinke of Montanisme. Adde hereunto that in so many bookes as Tertullian did write being a catholike, there is no mention of prayer for the dead, or suffering after this life of the faithfull. Last of all, Tertullian him selfe telleth you plainly, that Paracletus, the comforter (by which he meant the spirite of Montanus) had reuealed very often, that euery small offence must be punished after this life, in that the soule of any except martyrs, shall not go immediatly into Paradise, but tarie in prison vntil it haue payde the vttermost farthing. What needed he to cite the authoritie of his Paracletus, if he had spoken nothing but that which was commonly receiued in the catholike Church? Which saying, sith I haue set downe in Tertullians wordes in the page of Purg. 417. by you quoted, you needed not to haue made a question, whether this opiniō were Montanisme or no. But when you can saye nothing against this assertion your selfe, you would make me vncertein of it, and say that it is but a light suspicion of mine, because in one place, before I come to the found proofe of it, I say it is a probable coniecture. And doeth it followe therefore, that I doubt of it, because I offer a probable coniecture to other mens vnderstanding, before by order of the discourse, I am brought to the manifest probation of it? The other phrases by which you gather a doubtfulnesse, shewe your ordinarie manner of collections. And therefore it is not otherwise to be thought, but that the Montanistes added prayers for the spirites of them that were dead, &amp;c. Purg. 417. What vncerteintie is of that matter, whereof it is not otherwise to be thought? Againe: Finally, it appeareth, that the faithfull in Tertullians time allowed no prayers for the dead. Pur. 419. Call you that doubtfull which appeareth by plaine demonstration

before, pag. 417?
                  But for all your fine frumpe in the margent (all in Tertulian is Montanisme that Cyprian doth not mention) it is a probable coniecture, that prayer for ye dead, whereof Tertullian speaketh, was vsed onely in the conuenticles of Montanistes, because Cyprian which long after liued in Carthage, in all his workes, maketh no mention of prayers for the dead. But I weene Cyprian maketh expresse mention of prayers for the dead, by my confession, as Bristowe would haue men thinke, because I saye, of one place alledged by Allen, that it hath some couler for Purgatorie, which by flowe of arguments I easely washe of, that I neede not sticke in the lyme, as Bristowe sayeth I doe: but howe I am fastened therein, he sayeth neuer a worde.
               
               
                  Oblations for the dead.
                  I sayde that oblations for the dead, although at the first they were but of thankesgiuing, were taken of the Gentiles, as appeareth by Tertulliā, who counteth them of one originall or beginning with oblations for the birth dayes, falsely fathering them vpon tradition of ye Apostles, as he doth other vanities in the same place, whereas those oblations pro natalitijs were taken from the Gentiles, as witnesseth Beatus Rhenanus, a Papist, affirming, that by the Canons of the Nicen councell and other councels which he had seene in librarijs, they were abrogated and taken away. Bristowe sayeth, he is but a poore antiquarie, which knoweth not, that Natalitia in olde time, were as they nowe are the dayes of Martyrs sufferings: And yet he can name neuer an olde writer iustly, that calleth them natalitia. He nameth in deede Augustine in Psal. 118. Con. 30. Res. Insignita sunt tempora natalitijs martyrum: the times are notably marked with the byrthdayes of Martyrs. What print he followeth I knowe not, but my booke hath natalibus and not natalitijs: betweene which wordes there is some difference. As for Martyrologies whether hee

sendeth vs, I knowe none of such antiquitie, that they may be iudges in this case.
                  Tullie is a better witnesse what natalitia, being a substantiue, in olde time did signifie, namely, the feasts that were kept for the ioye of mens birthdaye 
                        
                           in Ant. Hodie non descendit Antonius. Cur? Dat natalitia in hortis. Antonie commeth not downe to day. Why so? He keepeth the feaste of his birthdaye in his garden. Wherefore Pamelius, as great an antiquarie as you make him, vniustly reproueth Rhenanus, for vnderstanding natalitia in Tertullian, to be feastes of the birthdayes vsed after the example of the Gentiles. The places you cite out of Cyprian, speake neither of natales nor natalitia, but of celebrating oblations and sacrifices for the commemoration or remembrance of ye Martyrs sufferings, which could be none other but sacrifices of thankesgiuing, according to your owne doctrine. Wherefore you shewe nothing to the contrary, but that Tertullian vsing the worde natalitia, vnderstandeth it for feastes of the birthdaye, and not of the death of Martyrs. And beside the authoritie of Rhenanus and Tully, for the signification of the worde natalitia, I oppose against you these reasons. First, that he addeth not the name of Martyrs, as all they that vse natalitia or natales for the daye of their departure, but sayeth generally, pro natalitijs. Secondly, that he spake immediatly before of oblations pro defunctis, for the dead, which you vnderstande for all faithfull departed out of the worlde: therefore pro natalitijs, signifyeth the oblation for the birth of all Christians come into the worlde. Thirdly, seeing he had before named oblations for the dead, it were absurde to vnderstand pro natalitijs for the dead also, without any more explication. Fourthly, if natalitia should signifie the feastes of the death of Martyrs (as you say,) it will followe also, which I do vrge of the place, that oblations pro defunctis for the dead, were but oblations of thankesgiuing as those for the death of Martyrs, which are conteined in one worde or phrase. As for that you adde out of Origen, in Iob. lib 3. Wee celebrate not

the daye of birth, &amp;c. But the daye of death, sheweth the custome of the Greeke Church, and not of the Latine, and their celebrating of their daye of birth with ioye and thankesgiuing, as the daye of the beginning of felicitie, and ende of all sorrowes vnto the deade, cleane ouerthroweth your opinion of Purgatorie, and prayer for the dead, as in his time, not yet entred into the Greeke Church. Beside that, he speaketh of the death of all men, and not of Martyrs onely, as you violently would wrest him.
               
               
                  Beeres to carry home the corpses.
                  He maketh a foolish quarell vppon my saying, that George of Alexandria inuented beeres for lucres sake, as the Papistes their bearing clothes, and other toyes, for funerall pompe. And first he sayeth, that George did not inuent beeres. For Epiphanius sayeth, he deuised to make the number of them certeine, and without those that he ordeined, no corps to be buryed, and all for lucres sake. Ep. H. 76. I neuer thought, that they carryed dead men on their neckes like beastes to the graue before Georges dayes, and therefore they had some kinde of comely carriage for them. But I sayed truely, that George inuented peculiar beeres, for lucres sake, as the Papistes vse their bearing clothes and like stuffe. Secondly he sayeth, I commend such ceremonies as are conuenient for laying vp of the corps. I do so: But superstitious beereclothes, and other ceremonies of poperie, so dearly payde for, are neither needfull nor conuenient.
                  Againe he asketh, whether I thinke it much, that the Church should reape their carnalia, to whome shee soweth spiritualia? No verily: but I could neuer learn out of the scriptures, that bearing cloathes, crosses, candels, torches, &amp;c. were such spiritualia, as the ministers of the Church ought to sowe. Last of all, where he asketh, whether I would prouide a beere and bearing cloathes against I be buryed, rather then to paye my dueties to

my parish Church, hee declareth, that hee doth wilfully mistake my saying of beeres and bearing clothes, as though I denyed any thing that is comelye, when I speake against superstition and couetuousnesse.

                     were in their times.
                  
                  He demaundeth what a thing it is that I charge the Church in the Apostles time with heresies, that were in Fulke. the Apostles times, and the same Church in three Arrian Emperors times, with the heresie of Arrius? I answere that I neuer charged either the Apostles, or the faithfull members of the Church, or the true Church it selfe, with any heresies that were in their times. But aunswering the demaunde Ar. 15. what Church it was that hath alwayes stoode still and stedfast, while all congregations of heretikes haue decayed: I say, The true Church of Christ hath alwayes stoode stedfast and inseparable from Christe her heade, when all heretikes haue beene and shall bee consounded, although shee haue not alwayes florished in worldly peace. For vntill the time of Constantine the great, the Church had small reste: And soone after vnder the Emperours Constantius, Constano, and Valens, it was greatly infected with the heresie of Arrius.
                  
                  Where Bristowe falsifieth my wordes, reporting that I saye, The true Church was infected &amp;c. the name of the Church is oftentimes generally taken for the whole number of them that professe Christianitie, as when I saye, the Church was persecuted by the heathen Emperours, I meane all that woulde professe Christianitie, among whiche were manye heretikes that suffered persecution also. Lykewise when I say, the Church was infected, I meane the visible Church, in whiche are alwayes manye hypocrites, according to the parable of the nette and of the tares, &amp;c. yea

I doubt not but many of GODS electe, were infected with that heresie in those times, which afterwarde repented and returned to the knowledge of the trueth: wherfore my meaning was nothing lesse, then to charge the true Church of Orthodoxie and true profession with the heresie of Arrius, or any other which it did openly detest and abhorre.
                  An other quarel he hath against me, where I saide, Ar. 35. That the true Church decayed immediately after ye Apostles times. In which place, after I had shewed what corruption of doctrine had beene receiued of yt greatest lights and pillers of the Church, from which it was not like, that most of ye inferior members could bee free: I conclude according to ye demand (which was to declare by good history or reasonable likelyhood, whē the true church did decaie?) that it decayed immediately after ye Apostles times, meaning as ye demaunde serueth also, to vnderstande the word of decaying, when it began to decay, &amp; not as Bristow cauilleth, whē it was vtterly decaied &amp; came to nothing, for such decaying I vtterly deny, yt euer it was, or euer shalbe. If we see some principall postes of an house, begin to putrifie, may wee not say, this building doth decaye? Or being asked when it decayed, after it is come to a more ruinous state, and yet standeth, may wee not aunswere, it decayed first, when such a beame or post began to put rifie? I doubt not but euery man of reasonable vnderstanding, wil acknowledge how folish these cauils are, which are taken of ambiguitie of words, and misconstruing of phrases cleane contrarie to my meaning, expressed in plaine euident tearmes, and hundreth times at least, in these my bookes, namely that the Church, although it be persecuted by tyrants, assaulted by heretikes, vndermined by hypocrites, enuyed and maligned by the diuell himselfe, yet the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile against it, to roote it out of the worlde, or to hinder the saluation of any one true member thereof.
                  
                     
                     Touching the errors of S. Cyprian, S. Irenee, &amp; S. Iustinus. 
                     Bristowe.
                  
                  If these doctors haue erred (saith Bristow) in any thing, yet this thing is notable, that not so much as in any one Fulke. of their errors, they are of your side. A notable matter in deede, that we hold not so much as any one error, which they did hold. But you wil not say ye contrary, for shame, but that we hold many truthes which they helde. We resist (you say) their ful &amp; whole consent. That is vtterly false, you haue not their ful &amp; whole consent, for any point of popery: prayer for the deade is ye oldest error you haue, except the superstition of Angels and ye pharisaicall doctrine of iustification. Shew me the ful &amp; whole consent of al the fathers for it, whose writings are extant, shewe me Iustinus, Irenaeus, Origenes, Cyprianus, Clemens Alexandrinus, or any within 200. yeares after Christ (except Tertullian a Montanist) that in his writings maintaineth prayer for the deade.
                  But you will tell vs, whereto you papists ascribe infallible truth: First to the canonical scriptures &amp; tradition of the Apostles, to ye decrees of Peter &amp; his chayre, to the whole church, to ye consēt of fathers &amp; councels, both generall and prouincial, confirmed by Peters successor. We know this wel inough, but I doe rehearse it in your owne termes, yt it may appeare you are not ashamed to match diuerse autorities equal in truth infallible, with the holy scriptures inspired of God, yt alone are able to instruct a man to saluation, and prepare him to euerie good worke. For these autorities, you vrge not onely where they agree with the scriptures, but also wher you blasphemously suppose the scriptures to be vnperfect, as that they haue omitted any thing needeful to saluation, or the aduancement of Gods glorie in true religion.
                  The errors of ye fathers, we doe not reueale to their dishonour, but to ye honour of God. Let God onely be true &amp; euery man a lyer, yea Peter &amp; Peters successor a thousand times. Whereas you take vpon you, to mitigate ye errors of the fathers, named in the title, you labour in

Last of all, where you say in excuse of ye error of Iustinus, concerning angels, that expresse mention is made Gen. 6. of the sinne of ye Angels, calling the translation of the septuaginta authenticall, which translateth the Angels of God insteede of the sonnes of God, you geue great cause of suspicion that you are not cleare of that error your selfe.
                  3 Touching second mariages, and S. Hierom. 
                     Bristowe.

                     harge the man or the time with more thā I can manifestly proue. But seing I quote no place for it, he dare say I haue it not in the workes of Iustinus himselfe, and counsels mee not to trust the Magdeburgian Centuries. As for the Centuries I dare say, I neuer redde fiue leaues of them together, or in partes. But I dare shew to any man that doubteth of my reading of the most auncient writers, my book of notes writtē with mine owne hande, more then 15. yeares past.
                  The place of Iustinus out of which such a matter seemeth is Apologia secunda ad Antoninum Pium, &amp;c. where he hath these wordes: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , As they that by mans lawe enter into seconde marriages, are sinners by our maisters iudgement. I knowe the wordes are otherwise interpreted by some, and the sinne not referred to seconde marriages, but to wanton

beholding of women: And therefore I doe not precisely charge Iustinus. And yet againe I say it seemeth, that the Church in his time was in some error, because Athenagoras a Christian philosopher, that liued in a manner in the same time, doth expresly call the seconde marriage speciosum adulterium, a faire kinde of adultery. 
                        Qui namque repudiauerit, inquit &amp;c. For hee that shall forsake his wife (saith Christ) and marry another, doth commit adulterie: suffering a man neither by diuorcement to put her away, whose flower of virginitie he hath defiled, nor to goe vnto seconde marriages. For he that depriueth him selfe of his former wife (although after she is deade a diuorcement is made) is a secrete and couered adulterer, transgressing the hand that is the creature or workemanshippe of God. Because in the beginning hee made one man and one woman, and dissoluing fleshe from flesh, ye vnion of commixtion instituted for ye participation of kinde and sexe, &amp;c. And this seemeth to be the common error of his time, because he writeth this in that Apologie, which he made in defence of all Christians, which it is not like he woulde present to the Emperor, in the name of them all, except he had written that, which was the common receiued opinion of the Christians doctrine in his time.
                  Concerning Hieronyme, Bristowe is angrie also that I say hee was almost falne into Tertullians error, when it is manifest hee was fayne to purge himselfe, not onelye against malicious enuiers, but also towardes Godly Bishoppes, and Christians. Apol. ad Pammachium.
                  
                  Where as I laye vnto Hierom, two other perilous Assertions, whereof the one tendeth to destroye the humanitie of Christ, the other to giue diuinity to the martyrs, where hee saith, The soules of the martyrs, follow the Lambe whether so euer hee goeth: and thereof concludeth, If the Lambe be euery where, those also that are with the Lambe, must bee beleeued to bee euerie where.
                  
                  Bristowe aunswereth, that the sainctes are not euerie

But what say you according to his humanitie, is hee euerie where? that is the question, and not of his power in hearing suters, or helping them. If you will defende the vbiquitie of Christ according to his humanitie, speake plainely, and ioyne with Hieronyme if you dare. If you interprete euerie where for all power, how can you giue all power to the soules of Martyrs, which they ascribe onely to GOD and the Lambe? Apoc. 7. And whereas you attribute vnto the soules of Saintes, such power, that they heare the suters in all places at once &amp;c: Let the reader see howe much you ascribe to Christe, that make the sute of euerie saincte equal with him in infinite power of hearing, vnderstanding and helping. For to heare vnderstande and helpe all suters at once, is a diuine priuiledge not communicable to any creature, that is not GOD. The argument therefore of inuocation of sainctes, whiche you acompte to bee so stronge, without horrible blasphemie, against the diuine nature, can neuer bee defended. The Sainctes followe the Lambe, not to bee of diuine nature, or equall power with him, but to bee partakers of his glorie, according to his grace, and the measure and capacitie of nature created.

                  Being vrged by the Popishe Articles to shewe the Fulke. error of the Church in any thinge, I shewe Pag. 89. of that aunswere, That the Councell of Carthage the 3.

cap. 23. confirmed by a generall councell, which is with the Papistes the Church representatiue, decreed, that the prayers at the altar shoulde bee directed alwayes to the father, which is no small error, seeing that hereof it followeth, that none ought to be directed either to the sonne or to the holy Ghost, or to the blessed Trinitie. What moued those fathers thus to decree, I know not: but certayne it is, the decree is erronius and offensiue. Bristowe cauelleth at my collections, as vnnecessarie, that no prayers may bee directed but to the father, whereas my wordes haue relation to such prayers as the councel speaketh off. Also that the verie prayers at the altar, may not be directed to the Sonne or to the holy Ghost, because for orders sake, they are appointed to be directed to the father: I say, sauing the authoritie of the councell, which appointeth them to be directed to ye father alwaies, they may not, otherwise I doubt not but they may. And therefore Bristowe laboreth in vayne, to proue out of Fulgentius Ad Monimum, &amp; Petrum diaconum, that the prayers, although they bee directed to the father, yet are made to the holy Trinitie, especially because of the conclusion, which hath in it the name of the sonne and the holy Ghost. And whereas hee sendeth me to the Canon of his Masse for proofe of the same, I must put him in remembraunce, that in Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, O lambe of GOD which takest away the sinnes of the worlde &amp;c: which is also sayde in his Masse, both the prayers is directed to God the sonne, &amp; yet no conclusion there is, naming the father and the holy Ghost. Let Bristow therefore choose, whether hee will defende the error of the councell of Carthage, or else acknowledge that ye Romishe Church doth erre, in directing the prayer at the altar to the Sonne, without any conclusion including the father and the holy Ghost.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , thinketh that to bee the highest point of learning, which he hath learned latest! But what if the councell of Trent doe not onely acknowledge it to bee an error, but also doe anathematise all them that holde the contrarie? Then haue I not slaundered the Papistes, but Bristowe hath slaundered mee. The verie wordes cited by Bristowe out of the 4. Cap. shewe that the Papistes helde it for an error, that it is necessarie for infantes to receiue the communion: That infantes lacking the vse of reason, are by no necessitie bound to the sacramentall receiuing of the Eucharist. Also the fourth Canon of the same session, thundereth out anathema, against them, that say otherwise. 
                        Si
                        
                        quis dixerit parvulis antequam ad annos discretionis pervenerint necessariam esse Eucharistiae communionem, Anathema sit: If any man shall say, that the communion of the Eucharist, is necessarie for infants, before they come to the yeares of discretion, let him be accursed. But the same councel in the Chapter by Bristow cited, affirmeth, that Antiquitie is not to be condemned, if it practised that maner, sometime, in some places, and that without controuersie it must be beleeued, that they did it not, for anie necessitie of saluation. And this declaration (saith Bristow) may suffice not onely all Catholikes, to whō it is the declaration of the holy Ghost himself, but also any other reasonable man. Indeede if any resonable man, wil be satisfied with such a grosse ledging of ye whole matter in controuersie, it is a good satisfaction. The councel of Trent saith so, therefore although Augustine, Pope Innocentius, &amp; other witnesses of antiquitie say the cō
                     trary, of themselues, yet we must not beleue them. That Kemnitius a Lutheran toucheth not this error of ye coū
                     cell of Trent, it is a great argument, &amp; such as Bristowe often vseth, that it is no error. Kemnitius if he had beene as quicke eyed as Bernard, yet saw not all things, neither was he bound to confute all errors that he sawe. But for further satisfaction of all men, Bristow will open ye case particularly, which is this in effect: The Pelagians affirmed, that children without baptisme, should haue euerlasting life, although not in the kingdome of God. Wherevnto the Catholikes replied, they could not haue eternall life, except they did eate the flesh of Christ, and drinke his bloud in the cōmunion: but the communion they could not receiue, before they were baptised, therefore without baptisme, they could not haue eternal life. Now Bristowe putting the case, that a childe were baptised, and then immediately dyed before he receyued sacramentally the Eucharist, demandeth, whether the father granting to such a childe by force of baptisme remission of sinnes, do not also allowe him eternall life and the kingdome of God. And let any man (saith he) bring me one place of those Doctors speaking to this case &amp; holding the

contrarie. I aunswere, seeing they vsed immediately after 
                        •

                     ay in their defence. They brought in ye Eucharist (saith Bristow) onely to proue that baptisme is necessary to the euerlasting life of children. Verie well: but what force 
                        •
                     n the worlde hath that argument of the Euchariste, for the necessitie of baptisme, if the Eucharist also bee not necessarie for children? For the Pelagians might reply, that if the Euchariste be not necessarie, no more is baptisme for the atteyning of eternal life. But those fathers labored to prooue the necessitie of baptisme for infants, by the necessitie of the Euchariste for infantes: And this appeareth by many places of S. Augustine. As cont. Iul. 
                           •
                        ib. 1. cap. 2. Where he speaketh of Innocentius Bishosh of Rome, 
                        Qui parvulos &amp;c. which hath defined that infantes except, they eate the flesh of the son of man can haue no life at all in thē. And there he meaneth of eating sacramētally: as his owne words cited by Augustine declare, Cont. duas Epist. Pelag lib. 2. cap. 4. speaking of the rescript of Innocentius to the Bishops of Numidia: 
                        Nónne apertissimè de parvulis loquitur? Haec enim ejus verba sunt &amp;c. Doth he not most manifestly speake of infantes? For these are his owne wordes: Illud verò quòd eos vestra fraternitas asserit, praedicare &amp;c. But concerning that your brotherhood affirmeth them to preach, that infants, may be rewarded with the rewards of eternal life, euen without the grace of baptisme, it is a verie foolish thing. For excepte they shall eate the fleshe of the sonne of man and drinke his bloud, they shall haue no life in themselues. But they which defend thē to haue this life without regeneratiō, seeme to me that they would make frustrate baptisme it selfe, when they preach them to haue that which we beleue is not to be conferred vpon them but by baptisme

&amp;c. And within fewe lines after Augustine saith: Ecce beatae memoriae &amp;c.
                      Beholde Pope Innocentius of blessed memorie saith: that infantes haue not life, without the baptisme of Christ and without participation of the body and bloud of Christ. Agayne, lib. 1. Cap. 2. hee speaketh against the Pelagians, which granted that baptisme was necessarie for infantes, to attaine to the kingdome of heauen, but not for remission of sinnes. 
                        Nec illud cogitatis &amp;c. Neither doe you consider this, that they cannot haue life, which are expertes without part of the body and bloude of Christ, seeing hee sayth himselfe: Except you shall eate my fleshe and drinke my bloude, you shall haue no life in you.
                  
                  Agayne, 
                        
                           Contra Pelagianos Hypognost lib. 5. Si enim intelligeretis, crederetis quare dixerit Dominus: Non opus est san
                              •
                            medicus &amp;c. If you did vnderstande, you woulde beleeue wherefore our Lorde saide, The whole neede not the Phisition, but they that are sicke: you would beleeue truely, that they are not whole, but wounded, which are offered to be healed to our sauiour ye Phisition, at the station of Baptisme: and that they shoulde not haue life, except they eate the fleshe and drinke the bloud of him which is life. For he him selfe hath said, Except ye shall eate the fleshe of the sonne of man and drinke his bloud, you shal not haue eternall life in you, and hee which eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life. Howe therefore doe you promise the life of the kingdome of heauen to infantes, not borne againe of water and the holy Ghost, Non cibatis carne atque non potatis, not fedd with the flesh of Christ and which haue not dronke the bloud of Christ, which is shedde for the remission of sinnes? For it is his decree: If any man bee not borne againe of water and of the holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen. For to enter into the kingdome of heauen is none other thing, but to liue in a blessed life which remayneth for euer and euer. Beholde hee which is not baptised and he also which is depriued of the vital meate and cup, is diuided from the kingdome of heauen &amp;c. To

the like effecte hee writeth, Contra duas Epist. Pelag. ad Bon. lib. 4. cap. 4. Si omnibus &amp;c. If reconciliation by Christ be necessarie, for all men, sinne hath passed oouer all men, by which wee were enimies, that we haue neede of reconciliation. This reconciliation is in the lauer of regeneration, and in the body and bloude of Christ, without the which, no not infantes can haue life in themselues.
                  
                  Also Contra Iulian, lib. 3. cap. 11. deriding his pietie, that infantes shoulde be damned for not doing that which they coulde not doe, he addeth, 
                        Vbi etiam ponis &amp;c. where also wilt thou place them, because they shall lacke life, seeing they haue not eaten the flesh of the Sonne of mā, nor drunke his bloude?
                  
                  Also de peccatorū meritis &amp; remissione lib. 1. cap. 20. a place cited by Bristowe but mingled with many intersections of his owne, as his maner is. After Augustine hath rehearsed the text, Ioan. 6. Except ye eate &amp;c: hee addeth 
                        Quid vltrà querimus? &amp;c. What seeke wee further? What can they aunswere to this, except stubbornes doe stretch their striuing sinowes against the constancie of the manifest trueth? Or dare any man say this also, that this sentence pertayneth not to infantes, and that they may without the participation of this body and bloud, haue life in them &amp;c? Likewise cap. 24. he saith, 
                        Optimè Punici &amp;c. Best of all, ye Christians of Africa, do call baptisme it selfe nothing else but health, and the sacrament of the body of Christ, nothing else but life: Whence, but of an auncient (as I thinke) and apostolike tradition by which they holde it ingrafted vnto the Church of Christ, that without baptisme and participation of the Lordes table, no man at all can come, not onely, not to the kingdome of God, but neither to health &amp; life euerlasting? For this also the scripture testifieth according to those thinges which wee haue sayde before. For what other thing doe they holde, which call baptisme by the name of health, but that which is sayde, hee hath saued vs by ye lauer of regeneration, and that which Peter saith, so also doeth baptisme in like manner saue

you? What other thing also doe they holde which call the sacrament of our Lordes table, life, but that which is saide, I am the breade of life, which came downe from heauen: and the breade which I will giue, is my fleshe, for the life of the worlde: And except ye shall eate the fleshe of the sonne of man and drinke his bloud, ye shall haue no life in you? If therefore as so many and so greate testimonies of GOD doe consent, that neither health nor life eternall without baptisme, and the body and bloud of our Lord is to be hoped to any body, in vaine without these is it promised to Infantes. Furthermore, if from health and life eternall, nothing but sinnes do separate, by these sacramentes, nothing but the guilt of sinne is loosed in infantes.
                  
                  These places of Augustine I haue rehearsed the more at large, that the impudencie of the councell of Trent and of their poore patrone Bristowe, might appeare, whiche would excuse the errour of the auncient Churche, and of the Bishoppe of Rome in those times, in saying that albeit they vsed to minister the communion to infantes, yet they did it not for any necessitie to saluation: whereas the contrary by so many places, and more then I haue rehearsed, doth most manifestly appeare.
                  As for the practise whiche he confesseth of giuing that sacrament to infantes, he saith is not against Probet seipsum, &amp;c. Let a man examine himselfe, &amp;c. Because that infantes may examine them selues by others, (whiche is a monstrous kinde of speache) as well as beleeue and repent by others. Here is one errour of Augustine defended by an other of his: for infantes are not baptized for the faith of other men, but because they are comprehended within the covenant of GOD, to whome baptisme is no more to be denied, then circumcision was to the infantes of the Iewes. The Prophet sayeth, Iustus &amp;c. The righteous man shall liue by his owne faith.
                  It is not the faith of other men that can procure

life vnto vs. Neither is faith required of infantes, before they can heare the worde of God, which is the onely ordinary meanes by whiche faith commeth. But infantes (sayeth Bristowe) bee in no mortall sinnes, being newely baptized, and therefore they neede no examination for feare least they should come vnworthily. Saint Augustine confesseth that hee was in mortall sinne, euen in his infancie: Imbecillitas membrorum infantium innocens est, non animus infantium: The weakenesse of the members of infantes is innocent, not the minde of infantes. Afterwarde hee bringeth examples of enuie euen in an infant, and at last concludeth: 
                        Quod si, &amp;c. And if it be so that I was conceyued in iniquitie, and that in sinnes my mother in her wombe nourished me; where I beseech thee my GOD, when LORDE was I thy seruant, where or when was I innocent? By this you see, there is no shorte time of mans life free from sinne. Neither may you cavill, that Augustine was not baptised in his infancie, seeing he speaketh generally of the condition of all infantes, which is not chaunged by baptisme, although sinne be not imputed vnto them.
                  Wherefore to speake after your Popishe supposition of Baptisme, that by the worke wrought all sinne committed before baptisme, is abolished in baptisme; what if the infant not knowing the mysterie of baptisme, be angry with them that haue taken him out of his warme clothes and plunged him in baptisme? is this no sinne? But what infant can examine himselfe of this sinne? And what can the examination of other men profite him whome the holy Ghoste will haue to examine himselfe? As for the distinction of Votum explicitum &amp; implicitum, he sendeth vs to Allens booke de Euch. lib. 1. Cap. 31. &amp;c.
                  For how can we be assured, that children haue a close desire to baptisme more then to the cōmunion? Or how can it be proued, That they haue any desire explicite or implicite to either of both the sacramentes? If 
                        〈◊〉
                      be lawful to imagine of infantes, against all reason,

and without all scriptures, wee may fill bookes with distinctions and deuises innumerable. Last of all, hee chargeth mee, with falsification by adding, because the councell of Trent saith, that manner was aliquando in quibusdam locis, some times and in some places. But I pray thee Bristowe, what haue I falsified? the councel of Trent, which thou affirmest that I did neuer read? Thou sayest they that did communicate infantes, were not so many, as Fulke doeth make them. Why, howe many doe I make them? I sayde that the Pope of Rome and all they that tooke his part in S. Augustines time, were in this error, that the sacrament of the bodie and bloude of Christ, was to bee ministred to infantes. And haue I not playnely, and now also plentifully prooued it out of Saint Augustine? where is then this falsification? If I had not prooued that which I sayde, yet there is difference betwixt falsification, and a false affirmation. And because the Tridentine councell sayth, it was Aliquando as though that error had not long continued, it is manifest that it began to bee ministred to infantes before Cyprians tyme, and continued fiue or sixe hundreth yeares after. Witnesse Beatus Rhenanus in Tertulli. de Coron. mil. where he sheweth that this manner was continued vntill the times of Ludouicus Pius, and Lotharius and after: citing these wordes out of the bookes of ceremonies called Agendae of infantes newely baptised. Si Episcopus &amp;c. If the Bishop be present, it must bee immediately confirmed and then communicated. If the Bishop bee not present, before the infante doe sucke or taste any thing, let the Prieste giue him the communion of the body and bloude of CHRIST, yea before the Masse, if necessitie require. By this Testimonie it appeareth not onely that this custome was long obserued, but also that it was ioyned with opinion of necessitie, so that masse should not be taried for, if the infant were in any danger.
                  
                     
                     Concerning the errors that he layeth to the Church of later tymes, and not of olde, and 1. touching the bodies of Angels. 
                     Bristowe.
                  
                  According to the demaunde of the challenger, Fulke. which requireth any one error or false interpretations of the scripture made by the Popishe Church, to bee shewed him, I bring certayne examples of diuerse kindes of errors, which are not the matters in controuersie betweene vs, but such as if the Papistes bee not impudent, they them selues will acknowledge to bee errors. Now commeth Bristowe in this his balde and confusd reply, and as though I were able to note none errors of the Popish Church, but those which I note vpon such occasion, willeth all them that would know the true Church, to consider that these errors (if they bee any) are so fewe and so light, that they may bee a sure confirmation to Papistes, and a iust motiue to all other to embrace the Church of this time, no lesse then of olde time, considering it is no lesse, but much more vnreproueable of ye aduersarie. Neuertheles as few and as light as these errors seeme, they are sufficient if they were but one, to proue yt which I intend: namely that the Popishe Church hath erred, which being proued the surest piller of Poperie is broken, and all the rest of their opinions which they holde against the scriptures, &amp; the true Church of God, when it is shewed that the popish Church hath erred, will shewe themselues to bee errors, which had nothing else to gayne them credite, but this one false principle That the Popishe Church can not erre.
                  And touching the bodies of Angels, where I say, Ar. 60. the seconde councell of Nice determined that Angels and soules of men had bodies, were visible and circumscriptible, and therefore must bee paynted, affirming this to be ye iudgement of the Catholike Church: Bristowe answereth, that I misreport the matter, for it is not the councells determination, nor saying, but the saying onely of Ioannes Bishoppe of Thessalonica, rehearsed in the councell, with an admonition giuen by

Tharasius B. of Const against the madnes of them that ouerthrew the images of our Lorde &amp; his vndefiled mother, seeing this holy father doth shew, that Angels also may be painted. But the trueth is (as may apeare to euery man that wil read the Councel, act. 5) that this is a vaine glosse of Bristow to elude the matter. After ye saying of Ioannes is rehearsed, in which this grosse error is conteined, Tharasius the archb. of Const. thereupon concludeth: 
                        Ostendit autem pater, quòd &amp; angelos pingore oporteat quando circumscribi possunt, &amp; vt homines apparuerunt. This father sheweth, that we ought to paint the angels also, seeing they may be circumscribed, &amp; haue appeared as men: by which it is manifest, that Tharasius approueth the opinion of Ioannes. Would you now haue the determination of ye Councel? It followeth immediatly, 
                        Sacra synodus dixit etiam domine: The holye synode sayde yea forsooth my lorde. By this it is manifest, that not I, but Bristow hath misreported the matter. Where I sayde (If this be not to induce an errour to make men beleeue that angels and spirites haue bodies visible and circumscriptible, there was neuer any errour since the world began:) Bristowe pulleth me backe and saith, Soft man, other manner of errours haue beene defended since the world began. I wot well, &amp; greater, but if any of them be a manifest errour, this is as manifest as any of them all. Yet is Bristowe so zealous in excusing this error, that he shameth not with that ignorant bishop of Thessalonica to slaunder many of the most catholike and auncient fathers with it, Basilius. Athanasius, Methodius, yea, Augustine (he sayeth) make a question of it. In which poynt he sheweth great ignorance or wilfull malice. For whatsoeuer is founde in any of those auncient writers, sounding to such a purpose, it onely by mistaking the worde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      or corpus, which they vsed generally, for that which nowe in the schooles (according to Aristotle) is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      or substantia, substance comprehending both bodies and spirits, not that euer they thought that angels, spirites &amp; soules of men had visible and circumscriptible bodyes, such as may be set forth by painting, or such as the bodies of men &amp;

beastes are, or that they consisted either of ayery of fyery matter, as that blynd Bishopp so imagined out of that verse of the Psalme. 104. He maketh his Angels spirits, and his ministers a burning fyer. Last of all he sayeth there is no determination of the Church to condemne the assertion as heretical, thoughe there be sufficient to count it temerarious &amp; erronious: whither it be hereticall, I will not nowe dispute, seeing by Bristowe it is granted to be an errour, &amp; I haue sufficiently proued, that it was mainteined by the whole Councell, which was as much as I required for that point.
                  2 Touching the Popes superioritie ouer the Councell.
                  
                  The determinations of the Pope and of the generall Bristowe. Fulke.
                      Councell, being accompted among the Papistes, as the rules of trueth, I sayde are 63. and 85. for so much as it is not agreed of among them, which of them is superior to other, the Pope ouer the Councell, or the Councell ouer the Pope, &amp; that one of these hath controlled the other there can be no certeintie of trueth in either of them. To this Bristow answereth, that he thinketh him selfe able to satisfie me or any other reasonable man, if he saith, that then we are in a right beliefe, when we hold those determinations that are the determinatiōs iointly both of the Pope &amp; of the Councel, as those of Trent. But he is gretly deceiued, for while it is in doubt, whether may erre, &amp; ech part chargeth other with erring, it may be, &amp; there is none other likelyhod to the contrary but yt they do both erre, so yt neither I, nor any other reasonable mā may safely tye our faith to any of their determinatiōs. For they wherof either part may err, being seuered, may also erre, but when they are ioyned together, you will say the Councels determination is vncerteine, except it be cōfirmed by ye Pope. But if ye Pope also may erre, how is it made certein by his confirmation? Another wil say, the Popes determination is vncerteine, except the general councel giue consent &amp; approbation therto. But if ye general councel may err, what certeintie is in ye approbatiō therof? So ye doubt is as great as it was before, wher Brist. affirmeth yt no man wil bind vs to beliue ye determinatiōs of any Councel yt are not certeinly cōfirmed by ye
                     
Pope: he sayeth more then he is able to warrant: for beside that D. Cole in his answere to the Bishop of Sarum manifestly defendeth the authoritie of the councels against the Pope, many popish diuines were and are of that opinion, that the Pope may erre, and is vnder the authoritie of the councell.
                  But where I shewe a manifest errour in the popish church by the interchangeable condemning and approuing one of another, of the Pope and the councell: Bristowe sayeth, the matter is not so vncerteine amongest them, as I make it. For first he graunteth, that the councell of Ferrara and Florence, determined that the Pope was aboue the councell, and that the councell might erre, and that Pope Eugenius 4. was of the same iudgement. He graunteth also that the councels of Constance and Basil determined the contradictorie, namely that the councell was aboue the Pope, and that the Pope may erre. But where I sayde, that Martinus quintus, chosen Pope by the councell of Constance, was of the same iudgement, there he cryeth, hoe, you proue not that, nor neuer shall proue. No shal, Maister Bristow? why sir, is it like, that the councell which had deposed three Popes, would choose a fourth man Pope, that was of a contrary iudgement vnto them? Yea, how coulde he accept the Papacie, beeing not voide, if the councell had not authoritie to depose the Pope, whosoeuer hee was of the three, that was the right Pope. But seeing Iohn the 23. was of the Emperour and the councell accounted the right Pope, who also before his deposition, affirmed that the councell of Constance was a most holy councell and could not erre: it is manifest, that this Martyn beeing a Cardinall, consented to the deposition of Iohn the 23. session. 12. therefore he was of the same iudgement that the councell was. But if you would saye, that as soone as he was made Pope, the spirite of Peter comming vpon him, he was soudenly changed into a contrary iudgement: his Epistle written to the inquisitors is plainly against you, where you saye, that at the petition of the Polonian Ambassadour, he confirmed

                        
                           〈…〉

                     uncell, that he commaunded it to be enquired of persons suspected, in articles as followeth:

Item, whether he beleeue, holde and affirme, that euery generall councell, and namely the councell of Constance doeth represent the vniuersall churche. If Martyn the 5. would haue euery man to beleeue that the councell of Constance representeth the vniuersall church, he would also haue them beleeue that the councell of Constance cannot erre, which councel condemned the Pope of heresie, and deposed him of his Papacye. Again, another Article: 
                        Item vtrum credat quòd illud quod sacrum concilium Constantiense vniuersalem Ecclesiam repraesentans,

                           nis moribus contrarium, hoc ab iisdem esse tenendum pro condemnato, credendum &amp; asserendum. Also, whether hee beleeueth, that that which the holy councell of Constance, representing the vniuersall Church, hath approued and doth approue in fauour of the faith, to the health of mens soules, that the same is of all faithfull Christians to be approued and holden. And that which it hath condemned and doth condemne, to be contrary to faith or good manners, that the same is of them to be holden beleeued and affirmed as a thing condemned. But the councell of Constance approued this assertion, that the councell cannot erre, and that the councell is aboue the Pope to condemne him of error, which is a matter greatly pertaining to the faith, &amp; the health of mens soules, therefore Pope Martyn the 5. was of the iudgement of the councell of Constance. Finally in the end of the councell of Constance the approbation of Pope Martyn is recorded of all things decreede

And the same things so done in forme of Councell, he approueth and ratifyeth, and not otherwise nor after any other manner.

councell of Constance, and especially that decree of the superioritie of the councell aboue the Pope, was decreed, &amp; pope Eugenius, for his contumacie was deposed and another elected, all whose actes also pope Nicolas confirmeth and ratifieth.
                  Likewise where as Bristowe saith that Pope Eugenius 
                           •
                        he 4. did no more but declare that the councell of Basil from the beginning to a certaine time was a lawfull councell and lawfully continuated: The truth is, hee did both by his owne Buls and by his owne deputies a great deale more then Bristow confesseth: and euen by this that he confesseth, it is easie to proue that Eugenius graunted the councel to be aboue the pope. For Eugenius had done what he coulde to dissolue the councell of Basil, and sent out three buls for the same purpose, notwithstanding the councell was continued by authoritie of the councell against his decrees: wherfore seeing he declared, (as Bristowe confesseth) that the councell was lawfully continued, contrary to his decrees (which he was compelled to reuoke) he declared that the councell was aboue the pope, and had authoritie to controll him and his decrees. And that he did more then Bristowe saith he did: It is manifest in the recorde of the councell, session 16. That Eugenius declared the councell of Basill to be lawfull and lawfully continued vntill Anno dom. 1433. 18. Cal. Ian. reuoking three bulles by which he had taken vpon him before to dissolue the same councell, in which bulles hee complained that the councell vsurped autoritie aboue the pope. Afterwarde sess. 17. Anno. 1434. 24. of April. being Saturday, the Popes legates were incorporated into the councell of Basil, being sworne to defende the councell, and by speciall words, the decree of the councel of Constance Sessi. 4. by which the councell is decreed to be aboue the Pope, and the Pope bound to obey the councell and the decrees thereof. And 6. Cal. Maij. The praesidents of pope Eugenius were admitted with these conditions vnder written: Videlicet sine omni iurisdictione coactiuo, saluo etiam modo procedendi in hoc sacro concilio hactenus obseruato, That is to say, without all iurisdiction of

And as this custome to auoide certeine daungers and offences is reasonably brought in, that although in ye primitiue church, this sacrament was receiued of ye faithfull vnder both kinds, &amp; afterward of thē which make it, it is receiued vnder both kinds, &amp; of ye lay people only vnder ye kind of bread; seeing it ought most stedfastly to be beleeued &amp; by no meanes to be doubted, but yt the whole bodie and bloud of Christ is truly cōtained as wel vnder ye kind of bread, as vnder ye kind of wine.

                     Bristowe. Fulke.
                     
                  
                  To color ye false interpretatiōs folowing, he cōmēdeth ye sayings of August. de doct. Christ. li. 1. ca. 36. &amp; lib. 3. ca. 27. in which first he requireth euery mā principally to shoote at yt sense of ye writer in expositiō of ye scripture, but if he misse yt sense &amp; hit any other which is not repugnant to right faith, or is profitable to build charity towards god &amp; our neighbor, he is not perniciously deceiued &amp;c. Vpō this Allen in his offer to yt protestāt saith, Ar. 86. &amp; 87. Let any man proue vnto me, that the true &amp; only church of god may falsely interprete any sentence of holy scripture, &amp; I recant. This generall offer without any qualification of not erring perniciouslye, or wilfully lying, as is conteined in Saint Augustines sayinges, vnto whiche

Bristowe woulde nowe seeme to make relation, I did accept. And first I proued that pope Innocent with S. Augustine and all the Westerne Church did falsely interprete this scripture Ioan. 6. Except ye eate &amp;c. and that to maintaine a false opinion of the necessitie of the communion for all persons, and euen infantes, that should haue life euerlasting, and therefore repugnant to right faith, as is more declared in the 2. part of this chapter.
                  Secondly I noted diuerse places of scripture, not onely falsely but also ridiculously expoūded, in the second councell of Nice, to maintaine idolatrie against the expresse commaundement of God, and therefore contrary to the right faith and the loue of God. Concerning these interpretations Bristow saith, that they are not the interpretations of the councell (whose interpretation they are not bounde to defende, but onely their definitions) but they are the interpretations of particular persons. To this I answere, they are contained in ye synodal book sent into the Westerne Churches, to stirre them vp to idolatrie (which booke was aunswered by Carolus Magnus or by Alcuinus at his commaundement, and in his name) therefore they are approued by the councell, yea some of them are contained also in that report of the councell, which is set downe in the bookes of councels. The text of lighting a candell, and putting it vnder a bushel, is affirmed of Bristowe to be well applyed in the Epistle of Constantinus, &amp; his mother to the synod. But he is deceiued. For there is no argument of setting of images vpon the altar drawne out of that text which is so abused in the Synodal aboue rehearsed, confirmed by Carolus or Alcuinus.
                  
                  The seconde text, God made man according to his image: therefore we must haue images in the Church: Bristowe confesseth to bee contained in the Epistle of pope Adrian to the Emperour. But the same is approued in the councell, and is the popes Epistle, whose credit is greater with you than the councels. But he doth not conclude (you say) that therfore we must haue images in the Church. What then? forsooth that a
                           •
                         Adam being

the image of God is to be honoured, so euery image is holy that i
                           •
                         made in the name of God, be it an image of Angels, prophets, Apostles, martyrs or iust persons. This conclusion conteineth more thē I vrged, namely ye worshiping of images, &amp; not the making of thē only. And because you are so impudēt to say, it is not the coūcel, but pope Adrianus that so saith &amp;c: I wil let the reader vnderstand, that in the seconde action, there were two Epistles of Pope Adrian, reade in the synode, one to the Emperours, the other to Tharasius the patriarche of Constantinople. Afterward Peter and Peters liuetenants of the Pope, required Tharasius to declare, whether he cōsented to ye Popes letters or no. Tharasius answered, that concerning the worshiping of images, he did allow the Popes letters. Thē said the Synod, 
                        Vniuersa sancta Synodus &amp;c. The whole holy synod doth so beleeue and teach. Peter and Peters Legates of the sea Aposto like saide: Let the holy synode tell vs, whether it receiue ye letters of ye most holy Pope of the elder Rome or no.

                  The 3. text (As we haue heard, so we haue seene in ye citie of our God. ps. 48. to proue yt God must not be knowne by onely hearing of his word, but also by sight of images:) Bristowe affirmeth that it is not the councell that citeth it, but a Deacon called Epiphanius, which readeth it to the councell out of a booke of his owne: I answere hee readeth it with approbation and good liking of the councell, which in effect is al one. But he citeth it not (saith Bristowe) to shew how God must be knowne, but about the storie of Christs manhoode, nor to proue immediately, yt the said story must be painted &amp;c. as though God can be knowne but by Christ, for knowledge of whom, by imagery, he cyteth this text of the Canticle also, Can. 2. shew me thy face, &amp; let me heare thy voyce. And whether it be immediately, or mediately, certain it is, yt he citeth this text, Pal. 48. to proue, yt the pictures of saincts are rightly deliuered in the Church, none otherwise, then the reading of the holy gospel.
                  The 4. text falsely interpreted in sense, &amp; falsified in

words is Ioan. 10. ver. 29. My father which gaue them vnto me (speaking of his sheep) is greater then al. Which text in the Councell of Lateran, holden vnder Pope Innocent the thirde, is falsified in words after this manner. Pater quod dedit mihi maius est omnibus. That whiche the father hath giuen me is greater then all: and interpreted to proue the eternall begetting of Christ of the substance of his father. To this Bristow aunswereth her
                           •
                         is no false interpretation in D. Allens sense. What sense Allen hath of false interpretation, I knowe not, sure I am, that a text cannot be truely interpreted in sense, when it is corrupted in wordes, which make the sense. Secondly he saith yt of my two crimes, I must strike out one: for supposing the text to be as the councell alledgeth it, the interpretation is not vnapt. But I reply, supposing the text to be as it is in deede: Such falsifying or corrupting of the words must needes drawe with it not onely an vnapt but also a wrong interpretation. But what couler of reason haue you (saith he) that the councell hath falsified the words of that text? Is it not in the vulgar Latine translation verbatim, as the councell alledgeth it? yes verily. And so is the councell cleared of that crime also. Not so soone as you weene: for if any falsifying or corrupting of the words of the scripture, haue crept into your translation, it had beene the councels dutie, not to haue winked at it, if it could haue seene it, much lesse to haue confirmed it, so farre forth, as of so many texts which cleerely proue Christ to bee consubstantiall with his father, it coulde finde none, but take this corrupted and falsified text. But the most auncient Latine writers, saint Augustine, saint Ambrose, and saint Hilarie doe reade iumpe as we doe, saith Bristowe.
                  
                  That doth not amende the matter one whit, but sheweth ye errour of the Latine Church to haue the longer continued, which in the councell of Lateran (if it could haue espied it) ought rather to haue bene reformed then confirmed. But will you chaunge your copie (saith Bristowe) and frame your accusation anewe against the translation as differing from the Originall, that is from the Greeke? Sir I neede not chaunge my copie, for my accusation

is alreadie framed that this text is falsified and corrupted contrarie to the originall trueth: yet Bristowe goeth on. But afore you doe so, take my counsaile with you, and bee sure first that the Greeke is so as you say. For some Greeke copies, of auncient also had euen as we haue: as namely, the copie which saint Cyrill, being a Greeke Doctor, expoundeth Cyr. lib. 7. in Ioan. cap. 10.
                  In deede it were not amisse, to take the councell of such a learned Grecian as Bristowe is, that I might bee sure howe the Greeke text is. For hee can tell me of auncient Greeke copies, yea namely of that which saint Cyrill a Greeke doctor did followe, and expounde, which agreeth with the vulgar translation in this text.
                  Verely the sight of such a copie woulde doe mee great pleasure. But vntill I may see it, I will suspende my iudgement, and in the meane time, I woulde borrowe a worde or two with Thomas Stapleton the peruser and allower of this booke of Bristowe. I praye you sir, Haue you perused and allowed thi
                        •
                      booke? What els? doe you not see it printed in the first leafe, Perused and allowed by mee Thomas Stapleton? And are you so good a peruser and allower of bookes, Maister Stapleton, that you cannot espie in them Chalk taken for Cheese? Doe you not see your scholer Bristowe alledge saint Cyrill a Greeke doctor to proue the truth of the greeke text lib. 7. in Ioan cap. 10. and when all commeth to all, there is no such booke of Cyrill the auncient Greeke doctor extant, but it is poore Iodocus Clicthouius a late Latine writer, that hath supplyed those 4. bookes of Cyrill that are lost. Wherefore to returne to you M. Bristow except your councel be better and sauour more of good learning and knowledge, you may keepe it for your friendes. As for your assertion, without doubt that the copie which your authenticall translator followed, had euen as hee translated, helpeth you little or nothing: which if it were graunted, howe can you proue that hee translated it as you nowe reade it?
                  Seeing it is certainly knowne to them that haue conferred

his translation with the originall, that beside that in diuerse places he giueth not the true sense of the Greeke, in many texts also he is corrupted, where he had translated right. Wherefore how fully I am aunswered on euery side cōcerning this text as you boast in the end, let the readers iudge.
                  In ye last place you set down my words Ar. 7. in which I accuse the Church of Rome for thrusting vpon vs that corrupt Latine translation, which all learned men doe know to be corrupt, in such texts as are the most coulerable places for the defence of popish doctrine, of which I giue one example for all. They allege the text (1. Cor. 10. Qui stat, videat ne cadat: he that standeth, let him take heed
                           •
                         he fall not) against the certaintie of faith, where as the Greeke hath not, hee that standeth, but, hee that thinketh he standeth, &amp;c.
                  
                  Bristowe biddeth mee looke better in the text, their translation is not as I charge it, but euen as I say the Greeke to be: Qui se existimat stare &amp;c: And therefore in the margent he biddeth, stand out of his light that the childe may see. Might not I say shore vp your eyes syr. Richarde, and see that I doe not say, the text is so translated, but so alledged. They alledge the text, Qui stat, videat ne cadat. And if you require mine author who allegeth it so: looke in Haymo vpon the verie place, and you shall finde these verie wordes. Qui stat in fide &amp; operibus, videat ne cadat: He that standeth in faith and workes, let him see yt he fal not. And if you woulde haue a later writer that so alledgeth it, looke in Gregory Martin one of your broode, who in his booke of schisme alleageth it in so many wordes: Qui stat, videat ne cadat, in the first chapter of his booke.
                  And what hath brought them to this vnderstanding, but your corrupt translation? Qui se existimat star
                           •
                        , hee that iudgeth or is perswaded that he standeth. For existimare signifieth properly to iudge or esteeme vppon good groundes, to thinke certeinely, and not like putare, which worde Ambrose vseth in the interpretation of this text, and signifieth to thinke vainly. And so is existimare
                     
vsed by your translator in other places. Rom. 6. Ita &amp; vos existimate, &amp;c. So you esteeme or iudge your selues to be deade vnto sinne &amp;c. And againe 1. Cor. 6 Sic nos existimet homo vt ministros, Christi &amp;c. Let a man thus esteeme or iudge of vs, as of the ministers of Christ. Againe Iac. 1. Omne gaudium existimate &amp;c. My brethren count it all ioy when you fall into diuerse temptations. In all which places existimare signifieth to thinke certeinely &amp; not vainely, as in this text, 1. Cor. 10. It should be qui se putat stare, he that vainely thinketh that he standeth, let him take heede that he falleth not. I confesse I might haue brought an hundreth places of scripture in which the corruption is more cleere vnto euery simple mans vnderstanding, but this I tooke to be sufficient, seing to proue the corruption of the translation, was not the principall matter of the demaunde which I aunswered, but to yeelde a reason why the popishe Church did not as wel corrupt the text of the Testament as the true doctrine conteined in the same.
               
            
            
               CAP. VII.
               
                  That he hath no other shift against our manifolde Euidences Bristowe. (so cleere they be) but the name of only Scripture, as well about ech controuersie, as also about the meaning of the scripture it self: And howe timerous he maketh vs, and how bolde he beareth him selfe heereupon.
               
               First he chargeth me with shamefull confessions, that I haue been faine to make against mine owne side, and Fulke. for their side: which what they are, you haue heard alreadie, and what shame I haue gotten by them, and what aduantage their side hath of them. Next he promiseth to shew the same more cleerly by running ouer those common euidences of Christian trueth, out of which he framed his Motiues and demands, which I confesse to be al against me, because I take exception against them, &amp; say that onely scripture is good euidence in such suits &amp;c. But what I confesse or deny of those euidences may best

be seene in my Retentiue against his motiues and demaundes.
               
                  The first part.
                  
                     Howe he excepteth by onely scripture, against all other euidences Bristowe in the controuersies that are betwene vs, and first against the rule to knowe heresie &amp;c.
                  
                  Hee rehearseth many sentences of mine mangled &amp; Fulke. interrupted with his owne glosses in which I professe, that No opinion is heresie which is not contrary to the holy scriptures, although it be accompted heresie of the worlde: where hee slaundereth me to terme them the worlde, which before I confessed to be the true Church. The places Art. 44. where I speak of them which preaching in these later times against poperie, haue beene of the Romishe Church condemned for heretikes, as Waldo, Wickelief, Hus, &amp;c. In the processe following where I sayd (yt if Aerius had not bene an Arrian, the opinion he held against prayer for the dead, coulde not haue made him an heretike) Bristow compting my saying to be blasphemie, (belike against the Popes kitchē) addeth yt it seemeth I knewe not the purpose of Augustine in his book de Haer. which he saith was the purpose of Epiphanius also, not to confute but only to report of heresies yt had benbefore his time: Seeing it is inough to know yt the catholik Churches iudgement is against thē: And that it helpeth much the faithfull hearte onely to know what must not be belieued, although he be not able to confute it by disputing. And why seeme I ignorant of this purpose? except it be because I said, yt neither Epiphanus nor Augustine, reproued by scripture, that which in Aerius they cōpted to be an error. But the case is so cleare (saith Bristow) that the very aduersary confesseth, that it was the Catholik Church that iudged Aerius to be an heretike. Yea sir for his Arrianisme, but I neuer cōfessed, neither can you euer prooue yt any iudgement of the Catholike Church in general councel passed against Aerius for denying prayer for the dead, before the dayes of Epiphanius

or Augustine, although the error of prayer for the

                     ead in that age was commonly receyued, not vpon any good ground of Canonical scripture, but vpon a corrupt custome first brought in by heretikes. Afterward where I following an allegorie of dogges vsed by Allen, tell him yt hee must not teach his scholers to barke &amp; baule against vs, nothing but The Church, the Church, like 
                        •
                     inkers curres &amp;c. he cryeth out in the margent, O worthy estimation that he hath of the Church, as though, I think lesse worthily of the Church, because I deride the vaine boasting of the name of ye Church in thē which are nothing lesse then the true church. Neither do I appoint mine enimy not to inuade me with a gunne (as he saith) when I make the scripture onely to be my weapon both inuasiue and defensiue. But it is a great absurditie as he 
                        •
                     weeneth, that I say an heretike is he which in ye Church, obstinately mainteyneth an opinion contrarie to the scriptures: seeing S. Iohn saith, exierunt a nobis, they are gone out from vs. And if an heretikee be a man in the Church we are cockesure, with all heretikes, and the Papistes onely in daunger. Why Bristow, make ye no difference betweene him that is in the Church, and him ye is of the Church? They be not al mēbers of ye Church, that be in ye Church, and therfore S. Iohn saith of them yt are gone frō vs, If they had bene of vs they would haue tarried with vs. And doe you account him an heretike that holdeth an error cleane out of the Church? then may you count all Paganes, Turkes, and Iewes, to be heretikes. What say you of Antichrist that sitteth euer in the Temple of God? it helpeth not heretikes, that they rise vp in the visible Church, from whence also they are often times cast out, so long as they bee not members of the body of Christ, which is the inuisible Church, and heauenly Ierusalem, which is the mother of vs all.
                  Where I sayde, that whosoeuer holdeth an opinion obstinately, which hee is not able to proue by ye worde of God, although hee haue many authors before him, yet hee is neuerthelesse an heretike. Bristowe addeth

in the margent, though it bee S. Augustine himselfe, and though he holde the foundation heere. cap. 5. Touching the former part, I say not onely though it were Saint Augustine, but although it were Saint Peter himselfe or an Angell from heauen, Gal. 1. Touching the later parte, I aunswere, my meaning is of such opinions, as are against the foundation, and so is my whole discourse, purg 412. whence this saying is borowed. Agayne, where hee concludeth that I confesse Aerius, Iouinian, and Vigilantius to haue beene condemned by the true Church of Christ, in such poyntes of doctrine, as wee agree with him: I aunswere as before of Aerius alone, I neuer made such confession.
                  In that I refuse to finde the firste authors of all their errors, he saith, I am faine to flee to my colde exception of onely scripture, as though to iustifie our doctrine, by the Apostles, and that so sensibly, were not inough. O sensible iustification, by which all errors, whose first authors cannot be found must be layd vpon the Apostles. But most ridiculous of all is Fulke, where he cōmeth in with this exception vpō Tertullians rule. Id esse verum &amp;c. That is true what soeuer is first, yt is false &amp; forged which is later. But how shall the first doctrine bee knowne, but by the worde of God, wherein all the doctrine of God is taught? What is here I pray you to bee laughed at? Forsooth, Bristowe saith, T

                      though it be profitable, yet it is not necessarie to bee often mentioned: &amp; to omitte altogether such matten as are necessarie to bee knowne, and not in one worde mention them. The purpose of the holy ghost, that Bristowe doth imagine, were in writing the scriptures to a bare effect: that the gospels were written onely to shewe Christ to say Consummatum est and al things to be fulfilled of him which were written of him: the Actes of the Apostles to shew, but as it were the first birth of the Church: the Apocalipse to shew the whole course of the Churche, to the ende of the worlde, The other bookes were written (saith he) specially against the perfidious Iewes &amp; other false maisters of that time: As likewise in euerie age afterwarde we haue the Ecclesiasticall (I say not the Canonicall) writers and councels. See you not how the blasphemous dog▪ restraineth the vse of ye Apostles epistles specially to the time in which they were written, &amp; cōpareth Ecclesiasticall writers and councels, wt the canonical scriptures? If this that he saith were true, the scriptures were not sufficient to make a man wise to saluation as S. Paul saith wtout traditions &amp; Ecclesiastical writers. 2. Tim. 3.

Chapter, thither also will I referre him for answere.

Augustine &amp; D. Allen had sayed, that the lawe of beleeuing should make a lawe of praying. And here he cryeth out of falsification by changing. So sayeth S. Augustine (saith Bristowe:) in that sense speaketh S. Augustine often against the Pelagians (sayeth Allen) but in what booke or chapter neither of both doeth shewe among so many treatises as Augustine hath written against the Pelagians. Wherefore if I haue altered the forme of wordes yet without falsification, especially seing it is a more probable sense and agreeable to the scriptures,

                  As for the 4. rules enacted by Parliament, for condemning heresie, if Bristow woulde vnderstand them like a quiet subiect, and not deride them like a scornefull traitor, he might vnderstand, yt the three later are not contrarie to the first, which determineth heresie by contrariety to the canonicall scripture, which is declared either in ye 4. first general councels, or in any other generall councell agreeing with the scripture, or may vpon occasion be declared by Parliament hereafter: Not that the Parliament euer did imagine that it had authoritie to make truth heresie, or to make any thing heresie, which is not contrary to the canonicall scriptures.

What if I woulde not? were I worse then the Thessalonians, or Bereans, which dayly searched the scriptures, to see if those things that were taught by the Apostles were euen so? Act. 17. But I abuse the scripture (saith Bristowe) and turne the curse that saint Paul pronounceth, Gal. 1. which was of preaching, as if it were of onely scripture. I aunswere, my wordes are these, if any man teach otherwise then the word of God alloweth, he is to be accursed: but seing wee haue no certeinty of the worde of God, since the Apostles departure, but the canonicall scriptures, which doe containe al that they preached, the same curse is rightly applyed to them that teach any other way of

saluatiō, then that which is taught in ye holy Scriptures. The rest of this diuision is spent in shewing that I hold

you neede not accept them, and yet approue your selues good Christians: remember who it is, that sayth, my sheepe heare my voice and not a straungers, &amp; let euery man see whereto the bragge of antiquitie is come, when you will not be tyed to the most auncient Churches testimony, and the eldest writers of the same.
                  Nowe, concerning other by quarrels, and cauils, whereas I sayde: Whatsoeuer we finde in the fathers agreeable to the Scriptures, wee receiue it, with their praise: and whatsoeuer is disagreeable to the scriptures, we refuse with their leaue. Bristowe noteth within a parenthesis: He meaneth expressed in the Scriptures. But who made him so priuie of my meaning? my wordes import no such thing: for many things are agreeable to the scriptures that are not expressed in them. I borrowed my phrase out of S. Augustine Contra Crescon homil. lib. 2. Cap. 32. which speaketh of Cyprian, that which I spake of all the fathers in generall.

                              •
                            pace eius respuo. I am not holden by the authoritie of this Epistle, because I doe not account the writings of Cyprian as canonicall, but I consider them by the canonicall, and that which in them agreeth with the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, I receiue it with his praise, but that which agreeth not, I refuse it with his leaue. I thinke Bristowe will teache S. Augustine shortly, by that which agreeth with the Scripture, to meane onely that which is expressed in so manye wordes.
                  Where I sayde, that when the fathers are opposed against the manifest worde of God, and the credite of the Apostles, there is no cause that we should be carryed away with them. Bristowe sayeth, in the margent, a
                        •
                      though we opposed the doctors to the Apostles. And what call you this but an opposition of the doctors to the Apostles, when wee saye, The Apostles haue not

taught prayers for the dead in any of their writings: you aunswere, but the doctors haue taught prayers for the dead in their writings.
                  Where I saye the authoritie of mortall men, is not to be receiued, he noteth our absurditie, because not onelye Melancton and such like (as Allen hath tolde 
                        •
                     s) were mortall men: but also in the same terme of mortall men, are the Apostles them selues comprehended. And what of this? Doe wee buylde vppon the authoritie of Melancton, or of Peter and Paul, as they were mortall men? No verily: Wee buyld vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Iesus Christ beeing the corner stone, and the onely author of the doctrine, whereof the Prophets and Apostles are witnesses, who spake and writte as they were moued by the holy ghoste, and therefore their writings wee receiue as the worde of God, which the spirite of God hath endyted by the penne of the Apostles.
                  Where I sayde: We dare not depend vppon any one man
                           •
                         
                        
                           •
                        udgement, for wee must depend onely vppon Gods worde. Bristowe answereth: Euen so dealt the vnbeleeuers, and the doubtfull and weake with the Apostles in their life time, yea, and 
                           •
                        ith Christ him selfe: and yet to winne such persons, both the Apostles and Christ him selfe, condescended to them accordingly. And why do not you follow the example of Christ, &amp; of his Apostles, to winne so many thousandes, as doe refuse your doctrine, because you doe not iustifie it by the authoritie of the holy Scriptures? But the faithfull, (you thinke) for all that were not so straite laced, but beleeued them vppon their owne worde, both Christ and his Apostles, because of the spirite of trueth, that he sent to them. And God be thanked, we as faithfull men, acknowledge without controuersie, the spirite of trueth in Christ, and his Apostles. But he hath not sent his spirite to them onely (sayeth Bristow) but also to his Church after them for euer. We doubt not, but he hath giuen his spirite to his Church, but not in such full measure, as to his Apostles. And if he had, how should wee knowe that Church that hath the same spirite, but by tryall of the scriptures, which were

vndoubtedly written by the same spirite. Bristow saith, the faithfull will no lesse beleeue the Church, at all times, for the same spirite, then the Apostles. He must first proue, the spirite so giuen to the Church, that shee can no more erre in her decrees, then the Apostles could in their writings. Secondly, if that were proued, the tryall of the Scriptures is necessary to discerne the true Church from all false congregations, which all boast of the spirite of trueth, as much as the true Church. And seeing the holy ghost by his instrument S. Iohn, biddeth vs not beleeue euery spirite, but trye the spirites, whether they be of God, we knowe none so sure a triall, as the consent of their doctrine with the holy scriptures, whether it be a multitude of men, or seueral persons, of one age, or another, of one degree or other, that offreth to teache any doctrine, which he or they pretende to haue of the spirite of God.
                  Last of all, where I sayde: Age can neuer make falshod to be trueth, and therefore I w
                           •
                        y not your prowd bragges worth a strawe. Bristowe noteth in the margent, It is pryde to follow the fathers, and humilitie to condemne them. Whereto I aunswere, to boast of the fathers to maintaine an olde errour, is stinking pryde, and it is not against true humilitie to make fathers and mothers, and all things else subiect to the trueth of Gods worde, reuealed in the holy scriptures.
               
               
                  The second parte.
                  
                     Being tolde that the question betweene vs is not (as he maeketh Bristowe. it) of the Scriptures authoritie, but of the meaning: howe there likewise against all the expositors, he maketh the same exception of onely scripture, requiring also scripture to be expounded by scripture.
                  
                  When in all this Chapter, you deny, onely scripture Fulke. to be of soueraine authoritie, sufficiency, and credite, to teache vs all the will of God, are you not impudent, to

saye, the question is not of the authoritie of the Scriptures? But I supposing the controuersies to be of the meaning, and not of the authoritie, Pur. 363. do aunswer nothing whether the likelihood b
                           •
                         on our side, or on the auncient doctors side, for the meaning of the scripture. What then? I aunswere, the question of the meaning of the scriptures is needelesse in that controuersie: where some of ye doctors confesse prayer for the dead not to be grounded on the Scriptures, other wrest the Scriptures so manifestly, that the Papistes them selues are ashamed to vse those textes for such purposes. This aunswere I trust, will satisfie reasonable men for that controuersie. After this, he sayeth, I count my selfe and my companions happie, for such blinde presumption, to search the meaning of the Scriptures, only out of the Scriptures, without the cōmentaries of doctors, but as he troweth, not without the cōmentaries of Caluine. But herein, as in all things almost, he belyeth mee: for I neuer spake word against the reading of the cōmentaries of doctors in search of the Scriptures meaning, but onely against absolute credite to be giuen to their exposition, without weying how it agreeth with the holy Scriptures in other places.
                  Likewise, where I compare the whole heape of superstition &amp; errour, out of which Allen raiseth a mist of mens deuises to a dunghill: Bristowe noteth, that I make the doctors writings a dunghill. Surely what superstition or errour so euer be in the doctors, as the sweeping of a faire house, is meete to be cast on a dunghill. Let Bristowe or Allen, if he list, say there is no superstition or error in any of the doctors. And yet it followeth not, that the doctors writings are a dunghill, more then that a kings pallace is a dunghil, because the sweepings thereof are meete for the dunghill.
                  To passe ouer his rayling termes of drunkennesse, &amp; blindnesse, &amp;c. Let vs come to the meaning of the scriptures, where I sayde, wee shalbe neuer the more certeine of the trueth, whether wee challenge, or leaue the likelihod of vnderstanding ye scriptures to the doctors.
                  
                     
Bristowe aunswereth, whosoeuer expoundeth the scripture vnto that wherein the doctors doe agree, shall bee euer most certaine of trueth (which is inoughe) though not alwayes certain of that same verie places meaning. Wee are then much the neere, when the question is of the scriptures meaning, if by the consent of the doctors, we cannot be certaine of the scriptures▪ meaning. And if that trueth (as we beleeue that all trueth) is in the scriptures, howe can we be certaine of the trueth by the agreement of the doctors, where we cannot be certain of the meaning of the scriptures?
                  Where I aunswere, that wee haue our measure of Gods spirite, as the doctors had, although wee agree not with them in all interpretations, euen as Cyprian and Cornelius, were both indued with Gods spirite, although they agreede not in exposition and iudgement of the scriptures: Bristowe replyeth, that Cyprian was of Cornelius his iudgement implicitè, though explicitè, hee were of an erronious iudgement. And so is euerie Catholike erring of ignorance, in effect of the trueth with other Catholikes not erring, because hee q
                           •

                        ly. continueth in vnitie with them, and doth not obstinately holde his error against them. But so is not the case betweene the olde Doctors and vs: for neither will wee bee reformed by them, neither woulde they be reformed by A
                           •
                        rius, Iouinianus &amp;c. whom he calleth our forefathers.
                  
                  If you haue no greater diuersitie then this, the case will be all one, for neither woulde Cyprian be reformed by Cornelius, neither woulde Cornelius bee re-Formed by Cyprian. But if the olde Doctors had heard as good reasons against prayer for the deade, of Catholikes in their time, as wee can make in this time, although they woulde not bee reformed by Aerius an heretike, yet charitie moueth vs to thinke, they would haue yelded to the trueth reuealed by a Catholike.

For all trueth needefull for vs to knowe (say I) may be prooued by scripture, either in plaine words or by necessarie conclusion, which is all one. Where I vrge Allen to shewe some sentence of scripture to maintaine prayer and sacrifice for the deade, Bristow saith, I confessed that I haue hearde of him diuerse sentences in the third chapter of his reply pag. 19. but reade that page who will, and thèy shall finde neuer a worde of such confession. The scripture it self, that I except against by calling for Canonicall scripture, is the booke of Machabees, which he promiseth to proue to be canonicall in the 11. Chapter where his arguments shall receiue aunsweres.

This proposition being in the copulatiue is false, for I admit arguments, taken either out of ye expresse and plaine words of scripture, or of collection necessarily concluding.

saith in the next chapter, I shall haue ynowe, yet if 
                        〈◊〉
                      will, one article shall be this. That Antichrist is not one certaine person: That I shall easily proue thus: One certaine person is not many Antichrists, there ha
                        ••
                      beene manie: therefore Antichriste is not one certaine person. The minor is saint Iohn. Epist. 1. Cap. 2. vers. 18. Againe, Antichrist is hee, whosoeuer denyeth that Iesus is Christ: One certaine person onely denyeth not that Iesus is Christ: Therefore Antich rist is not one certaine person onely, 1. Iohan. 2. vers. 22. Againe, Euery spirite that confesseth not Iesus Christ to bee come in the fleshe, is the spirite of Antichrist: but this is not the spirite of one certaine person: ergo Antichrist is not one certaine person. The beast described Apocalips 13. and expounded Apocalips 17. is Antichrist, but manie kinges are the partes of that beaste, therefore Antichrist is no one certaine person. The whoore of Babylon whiche is expounded Apoc. 17. to be the citie of Rome, is borne by the beast beforesaide which is Antichrist, but the citie of Rome is not borne by one certayne person, therefore Antichrist is no one certaine person.
                  An other article that hee requireth me to proue is: That the Churches flying into the wildernesse, at the comming of Antichrist, is to become inuisible to the worlde: Although this article bee not a matter of faith, in controuersie betweene vs, neither yet so affirmed of mee, as though to bee in the wildernesse, were nothing else, but to bee inuisible to the worlde: yet I will proue so much as I affirmed, that the Church being in the wildernesse, is inuisible to the worlde. The Church being where the multitude of wicked men are not, is to them inuisible: But the multitude of wicked men are not in the wildernesse: Therefore the Church being in the wildernesse is to the multitude of wicked men which is the world, inuisible.
                  Thirdly hee requireth mee to proue that the beginning of that comming and flying shoulde bee so soone after Christes passion. Before I proue this, it were reason

Act. 18. for 28. in which chapter &amp; 23. ver. S. Luke declareth how he proued the whole doctrin of the gospel out of the law of Moses &amp; the Prophets. Wherefore if Bristow had remēbred this, he might haue found yt S. Pauls arguments, were the same against the Iewes of Corinth, which he vsed against ye Iewes of Rome. For what other authority shold be vsed against thē, that denied Christ, &amp; beleue not his Epistles, but the authoritie of ye scriptur
                     •
                  , which they receiued? Wherfore he vsed none other arguments, but taken frō the authoritie of ye scriptures. Also he might find in the same chapter, &amp; last verse, yt Apollo
                     •
                   (who vsed the same arguments yt S. Paul did) proued by the scripturs, that Iesus was Christ. If he will cauill, that it is not said, onely by scriptures, let him accuse S. Luke, which hath omitted other argumēts, necessarie to proue Iesus to be Christ. But read you Act. 13. (saith Brist.) and you shal find yt he vsed against the Iewes, ye testimonie of certaine men, namely of Iohn the Baptist &amp; of his owne disciples. This is as good an argument, to proue yt he confuted them not by the onely authority of Gods word conteined in the scriptures, as if a man wold deny, yt a traytor was apprehended by the onely authoritie of the Prince, because ye constable arested him &amp; the Iustice made his warrāt to ye Iayler to receiue him. Iohn ye Baptist testified nothing of Christ, but yt which was written of him before in the scripture, no more did ye disciples or Apostles of Christ. Besid yt the testimony of the Apostles is not alledged for proofe of any doctrine concerning Christ, but only for witnes of a fact, namely yt Iesus was risen again frō the dead, according to the scriptures. Furthermore Bristow willeth 
                     •
                  e to read Act. 4. for ye argument of miracles, where it is said, seing the man also stand with Peter &amp; Iohn, which was healed: The gouernours had nothing to gainsay. A man hauing such daily exercise of conferring of scripture, as Bristow boasteth himself to haue, might haue alledged twētie places more proper for ye argumēt of miracles. But euen in the same place by him cited, the argument of miracles serueth not to prooue any article of doctrine, not conteined in the scriptures, but to

                  
                     〈…〉
                  onfirme the doctrin of the scriptures which was alledged by the Apostles, to prooue Iesus to be Christ.
               The second text of scripture is, in the boke of Pur. 6. where I say, that other persuasion then such as is groūded vpon hearing of Gods word, will neuer of Christians be counted for true beleefe, so long as the 10. cap. to the R
                        •
                     m. remaineth in the Canon of the Bible. To this Bristow answereth, yt the word of God is not only in writing, but in preaching, of such as be sent. And therefore wee account it the word of God, which we heare of the Church of God, either in her coū
                  cels, or in her doctors, or any other. For so said God to thé, he that heareth you, heareth me. I answere yt I spake not of the word of God only in writing, but in preaching, in councels or doctors, or howsocuer it be the word of God, but I say, the only scriptures are a sufficient warant for me &amp; euery Christian to try what is the word of God, &amp; what is the word of man. For he yt cōmanded vs to heare ye Apostles &amp; ministers, willeth vs not to beleue any doctrin which they teach, if they haue not the warrant of holy scripture to proue vnto vs, yt it is the doctrin of God. For since god gaue his word in writing, al spirits &amp; prophets, signes &amp; miracles were to be tryed thereby. Deut. 13.
               The third text Gal. 1. which S. Paul spéaketh of preaching, Bristow saith I alledge it of writing, &amp; of onely writing. In these words: Pur. 449. It vexeth you at the verie hart, that we require the authoritie of holy scriptures to confirme your doctrine, hauing a plaine cōmandement out of the word of God, that if any man teach otherwise thē the word of God alloweth, he is accursed? First he chargeth me wt falsification by changing. But what change I haue made, let the Lorde God iudge. Indeed I haue drawne mine argument from the worde of God, to the holy scriptures, because they are ye only certeine assurance of ye word of God. For how can I knowe certainely what S. Paul preached to ye Romaines, and other Churches, but by the scriptures, both of the old testament and the new, which he affirmeth to be able to make a man wise vnto saluation 2. Tim. 3? yea wherefore was the newe Testament written, but to assure vs, what is the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles?
               
                  
Therefore accursed be he, that saith the newe Testiment is vnperfect, and doeth not contayne in writing al pointes of the Gospell, that Christians are bound to beleeue to their saluation. But the scripture saith not, that the Apostles did write al that they taught, saith Bristow: yes verily, and that I prooue by this argument. The scripture testifieth, that all which the Apostles taught, was first taught of Christ himself before thē, Heb. 2. but whatsoeuer Christ taught, is written in the Gospel, Luk. 1. Act. 5. Iohn. 20. &amp;c. therefore whatsoeuer the Ap

                  stles taught, is written. And therfore the Church pretending the Apostles tradition, receiued by preaching, i
                     •
                   bound to bring forth ye Apostles writing or other holy scriptures, giuen by the same spirit. The fourth text i
                     •
                   2. Tim. 3. which I alledge in these words (saith Bristow) Purg. 410. All goodworkes are taught by the scriptures: which are able to make the man of God perfect and prepared to all good workes. First he taketh exception, that these are not the wordes of S. Paul. Indeede my wordes are an argument against prayers for the dead grounded vpon the scripture which Bristowe suppresseth: But supposing that Saint Paul had saide so, what a fonde reasoning is this (saith Bristo
                        •
                     ) because one euidence proueth all, therefore I can not haue any other euidence, but that onely? Sir, if one euidence prooue all, that which is not prooued by that euidence, is not prooued at all. But if to prooue that which is prooued alreadie, by that one euidence, you haue other good euidence, no man letteth you to vse them. Wherefore this is no fond kinde of resoning (Maister Br
                     •
                  stow) but such as the best Logicians do teach. All good workes are taught by the scriptures: therefore that which is not taught by the scriptures, is no good worke. But nowe S. Paul saith not, that all good workes are taught by the scripture, saith Bristowe. Hee saith the scriptures are profitable, he saith not, are able or sufficient to teach all good works. Againe he speaketh only of the worke of an Euangelist, and not of all good workes. To this I aunswere that immediately before Paul saide, The scriptures are able to make Timothie wise vnto saluation, through faith in Christ

Iesu: but no man can bee wise vnto saluation, but he yt knoweth all good workes meete for a Christian man to doe: therefore all good workes meete for a Christian man to do, may be learned by the scripture. And euen in this very text, where he saith, Al the scripture inspired of God is profitable to teaching of trueth, to disprouing of falshoode, to correcting of vices, to instructing in righteousnes, that the man of God that is the Euangelist, be perfect, furnished to euerie good worke▪ although you restraine euerie worke to the only worke of an Euangelist, yet that I saide, is necessarily concluded thereof. For it is some part of an Euangelists worke to giue example in all good workes, that are meet to be done by other men: but by the scripture he may be perfectly furnished &amp;c. therefore all good workes are taught by the scripture. Againe, when all the office of an Euangelist, which consisteth in teaching, disputing, correcting, instructing in righteousnes, may be perfectly furnisht at the scriptures: what can be more playne to prooue, that nothing ought to bee taught for truth, disprooued for error, corrected for vice, instructed for righteousnesse, but that which is taught, disproued, corrected, instructed out of ye holy scriptures? Seeing therfore, that prayers and oblations are to be made for the dead, is not taught by the scripture, it is no trueth. To deny prayer to be profitable for the deade, is not disproued by the scripture, therefore it is no error. To omit prayer for ye dead is not corrected in ye scripture, therfore it is no vice. Mē are not instructed in ye scripture to pray for the dead, therefore it is no worke of righteousnes.
               The 5. &amp; 6. texts, I alledge together Pur. 434. Search the Scriptures, and trie the spirites, to proue that the certeintie of trueth in vnderstanding the Scriptures, is not to be had but by the spirite, and the spirites are not tried but by the Scriptures. Against this conference Bristow saieth, Who euer alledged Scripture more blindly? And why so I pray you? because Christ saieth in the same place, that Iohn did beare witnesse to the truth. My workes doe beare witnesse of me: Also, My father who hath

sent mee, hee hath giuen witnesse of mee. In dèed, 
                     〈◊〉
                   Bristowe could proue, that Iohn Baptist, Christes miracles, or God his father, did testifie any thing of him, which was not before contained in ye Scriptures, neither had Christ giuen a perfect rule to find him in the scriptures, neither is that sentence able to proue that Christ may be sufficiently learned out of the holy Scripture. But if the testimonie of Iohn, of the workes of God the father, do all confirme the Scriptures, who euer alledged scripture more blindly then Bristow, to proue that Christ may not be learned sufficiently out of the newe Testament, &amp; the old, when Christ sendeth the Iewes to the old Testament, as a sufficient witnesse of him?
               Concerning the triall of spirits, Bristow biddeth me looke in the text: by this we knowe a spirit of trueth &amp; a spirite of error namely by hearing or not hearing of the Apostles. I like it very well. For where shall wee heare the Apostles speaking, but in their writings &amp; in the other holy writings, according to which they spake all, that they taught. Wherfore here is no tryall of the spirites, but by the scriptures. And where he sayeth the Romanes doe moste manifestly continue in that they heard of the Apostles, because no man can name yt time, the noueltie, the seducer, that they went after, although it were true, that no man could in any point shew (as he sayeth) yet the argument is naught, seeing it is proued by the Apostles writings, that they holde many things, not onely beside, but also contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles.

                  hing might be left to the will of man to deuise in the worship of God. You shall not doe, sayth the Lorde, what seemeth good in your owne eyes, but that which I commaunde you, that onely shall you do without adding any thing to it, or taking any thing away from it. After a fonde quarrell of the quotation omitted by the printer, and his coniecture thereupon: Moses sayeth not (saith Bristowe) That onely which I doe write, but that onely which I commaund. And so our sauiour Christe commaundeth the Iewes accordingly. The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chaire: and therefore whatsoeuer they commaund you, obserue it. I aske no better, wee must obserue that only which God cōmandeth, whether Moses or any other of ye Prophets, apostles, or Euangelists haue written it, whether ye Scribes or Pharisees, pastors or teachers do preach it. But where shal we finde yt which God hath cōmaunded? but in ye law &amp; ye prophets, in ye writings of ye apostles &amp; euangelists, which are able to make vs wise to saluation, which are profitable to make yt man of god perfect, prepared to al good works.
               As for ye pinnes saith Bristow, you may see in the doctors, they were not for that cause you imagine, of leauing nothing to mans deuise in yt worship of God. For how say you then by Dauid &amp; Salomon, who changed not only a pinne, but all the pinnes &amp; the whole tabernacle into the temple, &amp; ordeined musicall instruments, and manye other thinges for the worship of God, that the lawe did not mention. I aunswere, whatsoeuer Dauid and Salomon chaunged and ordeyned, they

did not by the deuise of man, but by reuelation from God, who had ordeined them to doe it. But mine error is (sayeth Bristow) because I do not distinguish betwene men that haue onely their owne humaine spirites, and men that haue the spirite of God, as Moses, the Prophe

                   and Apostles, and the catholike Church. I were in deed

                   in a grosse errour, if I could not distinguish the spirite of God from the spirite of man. But Bristowe erreth because he confoundeth men that were specially chosen, to receiue the worde of God by reuelation, and the same to preach and write, as the Prophets and Apostles: with the Church, which consisteth of men hauing the spirite of adoption: but for the certeintie of trueth, buylded vpon ye foundation of the Prophets &amp; Apostles, or else erring if they depart from that foundation.

The argument that angreth him, is this: All true doctrine is taught in the Scriptures: Purgatorie is not taught in the scriptures: therefore Purgatorie is no true doctrine. Here are two faultes sayeth Bristowe, one because the maior is false, the other supposing the maior were true, yet cannot the argument be opposed to our arguments of traditions, councels, fathers. I will first proue the maior. That whereby the man of God may be made perfect, furnished to all good workes, is taught in the Scriptures. 2. Tim. 3. All true doctrine is that whereby the man of God may be made perfect, prepared to all good workes: Therefore all true doctrine

                      Pope cannot erre, is not auoided by saying the Apostles cannot erre. For vndoubtedly the Apostles did erre. That their preachings and writings were not erronious, it was because they were not theirs, but the enditing of the holy ghoste by them. But that the holy ghost speaketh not so by the Pope, it is manifest by this, that he hath spoken contrary to the spirite of God in the Scriptures, not onely in matters of controuersie betweene him and vs, but also in heresies condemned by both partes.
                  The 2. text is Ar. 88. where I saye: The true &amp; onely Church of God, hath no such priuilege graunted, but that she may be deceiued in some things: for her knowledge is vnperfect, &amp; her prophecying is vnperfect. Bristowe replyeth, that S. Paul in that speach includeth him selfe: Our knowledge &amp; our prophecying &amp;c. is vnperfect, whether we speake or write. And sayth, that he troweth I will not say, that S. Paul might be deceiued in his writings &amp; epistles: &amp; no more may the Church be, I answere if S. Paul had proceeded further in prophecying, then according to such knowledge as he had by reuelation, &amp; argumentation out of ye scriptures, he might haue erred. That he did not erre in his writings, it was not because it was impossible for him to erre, but because he did write nothing but that he had, either by reuelation of Iesus Christes spirit, or by argumentation out of the holy scriptures. And therfore, except ye church haue such warrant, as the Apostles &amp; elders had by reuelation &amp; the Scriptures Act. 15. she cannot truely say, It hath beene thought good to ye holy ghost &amp; vs.

Al our fathers were baptised and communicated wt the bodie and bloude of Christ, or else finde vs some other way of saluation, then in the bodie of Christ, whose member whosoeuer is not, is sure of damnation: or say that the Iewes being the members of the bodie of Christ, were not the Church of Christ.

                     erely. For ye idolatrie of Rome is nothing lesse, in this time then it was in his time of Ierusalē. But I am too too ignorant (Bristow saith) in the scriptures, if I know not herein the difference betweene the synagogue of the Iewes and the Church of Christ, to wit that the synagogue with her Ierusalē might &amp; shuld be diuorced, but the Church of Christ with her Ierusalem (which is Rome saith Bristow) if you haue any sight in the Actes of the Apostles should neuer, nor neuer might be diuorced, &amp;c. If mine ignorance be so great, why do you not with one text at the least help to teach me, yt the visible Church of Christ since his incarnation, consisting of the Gentiles, may not as wel be separated from him, as the Church of Christ before his incarnation, consisting of the Iewes?

But lest you should imagine these dayes to be common dayes of 24. houres long, as you seeme to doe of the 1260. dayes &amp;c. you may see, that the inhabitants of the earth, could not haue time to publish their death and send giftes, &amp;c. in so short a season as three dayes and an halfe of naturall dayes account. But you say the preaching shall be as generall as the persecution. That cannot be of so smal 2 number of witnesses. For that you quote Apoc. 14. pertaineth to the time of Antichristes consumption towarde the end, and his final destruction, for immediatly followeth the Angell, shewing the fall of Babylon.

of Apoc. 12. &amp; 20. of the loosing of Satan for a short season. Why man? short and long be Relatiues. The time of Satans loosing is short, in comparison, either of the long time that he was bound, or of the long and eternall time in which he shall remaine in perpetuall bondage. For though Antichrist raigned in open reuelation, and not in mysterie of iniquitie onely, by the space of 807. yeares, more or lesse, and yet be not vtterly consumed, but yet in his consumption: Neuerthelesse, for a whole 1000. yeares after Christ, the gospell of saluation continued in the church, though much defiled with superstition, yet sounde in the onely foundation, Christe, openly testified by sundry publike teachers, vntill Syluester the seconde, Anno Domini 1000. by the diuell him selfe (as euen the Popish stories confesse) was put in possession of the See of Rome, &amp; then was the church driuen into greater straightes then euer before; the doctrine of saluation being turned into idolatry and blasphemie.
                  But it is monstrous, that Bristow expoundeth the consummation of the 1000. yeares, by the gospell, speaking of the consummation of the worlde, Matt. 24.

to passe before the reuealing, but not before the apostasie, because it is his owne drousie imagination, without grounde, I will not vouchsafe to confute, especially, seeing the Apostle ver. 3. ioyneth the Apostasie and the reuelation immediately together.

But let him looke on the commentarie of Bullinger, Alphonsus, Chytraeus, Iohn Bale, and other, and he shal finde a neerer agreement of that kingdome to the Pope and his lecherous Locusts, the Monkes and Fryers, then he can imagine vnto vs. I passe ouer the abomination of desolation, which one while he maketh Luthers and Caluins inuentions; another while, the kings armes set in place of the moste sweete and glorious roode; yea, the image of a vile grassehopper in a church that is well knowen, which is an vmbraticall desolation, as the images of Iupiter and the Emperors were in the temple &amp;c. matters to be laughed at, although perhaps he lye, because he dare not name the church, or else is afrayd it should be refourmed, if any vaine painter hath set vp such images. And yet what more common in Poperye, then not onely to paint, but also to carue the images of kings, and noble mens armes, euen vpon the roodeloft of the Churches, where they were patrones? At last hee challengeth mee to ioyne with him vppon his last demaund, which is apostasie, vnto which I haue aunswered long since. Finally, he will discharge the Pope from being antichrist, by the commentarie which the scripture it selfe makes. The seuen heads are seuen hilles, vppon which the woman sitteth: And they are seuen

kings: whereof fiue are falne, which are the persecu
                     
                        •
                     ing kings, before the time when this was spoken. What then? One is presently, who therefore is ment of the Romane Emperors, and all other kings persecuting with them. The other is not yet come, and when he commeth, he must remaine a short season, who euidently is Antichrist in proper person.
                  This exposition hitherto may agree with the Pope: Nay (sayth Bristowe) for he must remaine not a long season, as the fiue, and as the one, but a short season, only three yeares and an halfe. But where haue you the length of his continuance compared with the fiue and one? All the time of the Churches persecution is but short, in comparison of the infinite comfort, that she shal haue euerlastingly, though it be long in the iudgement of fleshe and blood, measuring the time by the breuitie of mans life, and the seasons of this worlde, as Bristowe doeth the three yeares and an halfe. But this is worthie to be noted, that he expoundeth the sixt king for the whole state of Romane Emperors, and other persecuting kings, as he doeth the fiue kings that were past, and yet against all reason and analogie, wold haue the seuenth (which is antichrist) to be one singular man, so to auoide, that the whole rabble of Popes cannot be antichrist. Nowe followeth the exposition of the tenne hornes, which are tenne kings, which haue not yet taken kingdome, but they shall take power as kinges euen in one houre with the beast, that is, together with Antichrist (sayth he) to serue him as his feede knights. I maruell whether he will not expound the houre in this place for the 24. part of a naturall daye. For otherwise wee see by histories, that the aduauncement of the Pope, was the decay of the Empire in the West, and with him arose a multitude of kings in euery prouince, which before were subiect to one Emperour.
                  
                     And so you see euidently (sayth Bristowe) by these seuen hilles, thus expounded, that the woman which sitteth vpon them, is not so little a one, as you do make her, but that shee is Mundus

impiorum: the whole worlde of wicked men. But where do we see this euident exposition of the seuen hilles? wee haue seene the exposition of the seuen heades, to bee seuen kings, and also seuen hills: but we see no exposition of the hills, who must needs be taken in their proper sense, because they are the exposition of anothe
                        •
                      figuratiue speach, namely seuen heades. But the woman (you say,) is no little one, which sitteth on the seuen hilles, but the worlde of wicked men. Let the holye ghost I pray you expounde the woman, as well as the heades of her beast. And the woman which thou sawest is that great citie which hath the kingdome ouer the kinges of the earth. This is a cleare exposition of the whore of Babylon, the woman; and as cleare a description of the citie of Rome, which in that time, had the kingdome ouer the kinges of the earth, and is the citie builded vppon seuen hilles, before expounded to be one of the significations of the seuen heades, a persecuter of the sainctes vnder the Emperors, and a poisone
                        •
                      and persecutor of the Church vnder the Popes. And therefore Mundus impiorum is a false exposition, which I will prooue by this reason. The whore of Babylon is a great citie, hauing dominion ouer ye kings of the earth: but the whole worlde of wicked men is not a great citie, hauing dominion ouer the kinges of the earth: therfore the whore of Babylon is not the whole worlde of wicked men. Againe, The whore of Babylon is a citie situated vpon seuen hilles: The whole worlde of wicked men is not a citie situate vppon seuen hils: therefore the whore of Babylon is not the whole world of wicked men.

                     ion: ergo there is no comfort in praying for their soules. 
                        〈◊〉
                      aunswere, mine argument is apt and good to confute Allen, which citeth that place to prooue, that as immoderate mourning, is against the hope of the resurrectiō, so being ioyned with praiers and almes, it hath the liuely hope of life in those that sleepe in peace. This aduantage Bristowe hath, by rending and tearing mine argumentes from the bodie of my booke, that it cannot bee perceiued, vppon what ground I vse them. Neuerthelesse hauing often before in that aunswere to Allen, protested that hee coulde bring nothing out of the scriptures for allowing prayer for the deade, this argument is to be referred to the same conclusion, after this manner. If in most conuenient place, the holy ghost 
                        •
                     oyne not prayer and almes to moderate mourning for the departed, then doeth he ioyne them in no place: but in most cōuenient place he ioineth not: ergo in no place. The maior is prooued by the wisedome of Gods spirit, which alwayes choseth that which is most conuenient: the minor is manifest and granted: ergo the conclusion is true. But Bristowe asketh me if I preaching to moderate the mourning of the faithfull, vse none other comfort then these two? I answere him concerning the state of the departed, I vse none other proper places of cōfort but these two, the hope of their glorious resurrection, &amp; their quiet rest in the meane time. But S. Paul, saith Bristowe, speaketh nothing of their quiet rest after death, although he name them that are asleepe in the Lorde. If they sleepe in the Lord, they are not onely at rest, but in happinesse. Can you interprete to sleepe in the Lord, to be in hellish torments, such as you faine your purgatorie paines to be? Are they not blessed which die in ye Lord? The Prophet Esay saith, cap. 57. of ye righteous after their death, yt
                     
there shalbe peace, they shall rest in their beddes: Ergo, they that sleepe in the Lord, enioy a quiet rest.
                  The 2. argument is out of 1. Cor. 11. Saint Paul reherseth what he receiued and deliuered concerning the sacrament, but oblation for the dead, he rehearseth no
                        •
                      
                     ergo he neither receiued nor deliuered it. So you make (sayth Bristowe) as though the Apostle there prescribeth the whole order of ministration contrary to that he sayeth afterwarde, of setting other things in order. I answere, that obiection is auoided in the same place immediatly after, Pur. 362. &amp; therefore I will not here repete the answere. And that it is not of one place negatiuely, you your selfe here confesse, that I denye it to be written by any of the Euangelistes which entreat of the sacrament. But you are not ashamed to affirme, that the Apostle intended no more in that place, but to correct the sinne of vnworthie receiuing, vppon coulot of a place of Augustine, 
                        
                           Ep. ad Ian. 118. Cap. 3. Inde enim. For that respect, the Apostle also sayeth, that they receiue it vnworthily, who do not by a reuerence singularly dewe, discerne it from other meates, as sufficiently appeareth through that same whole place in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, if it be diligently considered. Doth Augustine say, or can any man proue out of his saying, that he ment, that S. Paul intended no more, but to correct the sinne of the vnworthie receiuing? But admitt it were so, how could he better correct that sinne, then by shewing the whole institution, substantiall matter and fourme, ende and vse of that sacrament, and so he doth, although ceremonies and externall obseruations about it, he doth not expresse.
                  The third argument is out of Leu. 21. and Numer. 19. which prescribe what law was appointed for lamenting the dead and diuerse other ordinances concerning the dead, in which was no sacrifice, or prayer for the dead was offred, but that they were so separated from the liuing, that the priestes might haue nothing to do with them but in speciall cases. Bristowe sayeth, I might as well conclude that the dead should not be buryed. In

                     rifice for sinne generally to lay their hand vppon the head of the beast to be sacrificed. Hereunto Bristowe replyeth, that this grosse absurditie would follow, that

                     acrifice for sinne could not be offered, but of thē that were present: therefore not for the children, the sicke,

                     ities, coulde be offred for the absent: and especially for the vncircumcised which could not haue remission of sinnes, before they were ingraffed into the people of God, but temporall benefites at the prayers of Gods people they might obteine. As for children, sicke,

captiues, &amp;c. they might haue remission of sinnes without sacrifice, which was but the Sacrament thereof, as well in their childhoode, sickenesse, captiuitie, when they coulde not offer according to the lawe, as in time of desolation and destruction of the Temple, when no sacrifice for sinne coulde be offered by any or for any, but onely in the place where the tabernacle or temple was. Wherefore the sacrifice of Iudas Machabaeus wheresoeuer hee learned it, hath no warrant i
                        •
                      the law.
                  The fourth argumēt, of the whole scripture negatiuely to conclude, I saide it is good logike, after this manner. All true doctrine is taught in the scripture: Purgatorie is not taught in the scripture: therefore purgatorie is no true doctrine. Bristowe denyeth both the maior and minor. The maior I haue prooued in this chapter, part 1. after the examination of the 8. text of scripture. The minor hee would prooue to be false by these reasons. First purgatorie is taught in the scripture in the Machabees, Which he saith is in the canon of the true Church, which I also confesse, to be the true Church in the thirde counce
                           〈…〉
                         of Carthage, and therefore it is canonicall, if any other scripture be Canonicall. Supposing that which is false, that the Macabees were canonicall, yet is not Purgatorie prooued by them: prayer for the deade doeth not necessarily drawe purgatorie after it. The Grecians of longe time haue vsed prayer for the deade, yet they doe not receiue the doctrine of purgatorie. But to prooue the Machabees to be Canonical, he citeth the third councel of Carthage, wherein the two bookes of Machabees are accounted amongest the rest. But there are also fiue bookes of Salomon, whereas wee knowe there are onely three, namely the Prouerbes, the Canticles and the Preacher. Therefore that canon prooueth a manifest error of the councell to allowe fiue bookes of Salomon in steede of three. Let Bristowe now bring out the fourth and fifth booke of Salomon, and say they bee Canonicall, if any other scripture bee Cano nicall.
                  
                     
The Councell of Laodicea more auncient, nameth not the Machabees. Hierome a Priest of Rome expressely denyeth them to bee Canonicall, Praefatione 
                           •
                        n Prouerbia. Ruffinus also, in his exposition of the Creede, affirmeth the Church not to receiue them as Canonicall: beside so many argumentes as the bookes them selues, doe minister which agree, that they were writen by the spirite of man, and not by the spirite of God.
                  To proceede, Bristow saith that purgatory is taught so plainely 1. Iohn 5. that I could not auoyde the place but by falling into this horrible absurditie, that wee may not praye for all men liuing. I saide in deede we ought not to pray for them that sinne vnto death, of which Iohn saith: I say not that you shoulde pray for it, or that any man should pray for it, as your vulgar trāslation hath it: But howe it is prooued out of that place, he saith neuer a worde.
                  Last of all purgatorie is taught (saith Bristowe) Specially against you sir. Iohn 11. For you say after your manner passing confidently, that Martha and Marie (as the scripture is manifest) did not hope for any restitution of their brother Lazarus to his bodie, before the generall resurrection. If that bee so manifest, what else was it then but the rest of his soule that Martha woulde haue Christ to pray for, when shee saide thus, vnto him: But also nowe I knowe that what soeuer thinges, thou shalte aske of God, God will graunt thee? To which purpose also some auncient writers expounde the place. Thus farre Bristowe. But I pray you sir, why doe you not tell vs the names at least of those auncient writers that so expounde the place; Peraduenture they were not worth the naming. But are you such a cunning disputer ex concessis, to wrest that I say of Martha and Marie before the comming of Christe, to all times after? as though I sayd, that they neuer hoped for their brothers restitution, because they hoped not before Christe came to Bethanie, as Allen impudently coniectureth, that Lazatus was restored to his bodye at their

prayers made at his tombe: where there is no mention of any prayers, but of lamentation only. I can not tel whether I shuld here require in you more wit or honestie, or else lesse impudence, &amp; malice. But this was your purpose of cauilling and quarilling, when you durst not attempt the confutation of my bookein such plaine order as I aunswered Allen, but in this confuse manner, to bring all my argumentes first out of ioynt, and then to play with them at your pleasure.

                     foundations of purgatorie, and prayer for the dead.
                  
                  I saide, the worde of God ouerthroweth the popish distinction of sinnes mortall &amp; Veniall, shewing that Fulke. all sinnes of their owne nature deserue eternall death: and yet all by the mercie of God are pardonable or veniall, except the sinne against the holy ghost. Bristowe saith, that I here graunt the doctrine, and yet deny the distinction: which is vtterly false: for, that all sinnes deserue eternall death, and yet be pardonable, it ouerthroweth the doctrine and distinction both. For the Papistes holde, yt there are some sinnes so small, as they deserue not in their owne nature eternal damnation, as Bristow immediately hereafter confesseth, where he denieth that the curse of God pronounced Deut. 27. and Gal. 3. against all them that abide not in all thinges written in the lawe, extendeth not vnto eternall death, saying that hanging on tree, or crucifying is not eternal death, and yet is accursed of God Deut. 21.
                  Againe, euery one, in the saying of the Apostle, is not meant of Christians, but of them, which trust in the lawe it selfe &amp;c. Doe you not heare playnely the olde serpentes voyce, Nequaquam moriemini: Tush you shall not die, the curse of God doeth not bring eternall death, you neede not be so greatly affraide of it, &amp;c?

                      vnto this curse, howe the serpent denying this curse to bee the assurance of eternall death, maketh the case of them to bee nothing so daungerous, but continuing vnder the Lawe, they may auoyde eternall death. And where he saith euerie one in the Epistle, is not meant of Christians, I woulde knowe of him whether

the Galathians, to whome saint Paule writeth, were not Christians, but yet seduced by false Apostles, to take vpon them the obseruation of the lawe, which as it was impossible, so it would bring them from ye blessing of Christ, vnto the curse of God. That true Christians are discharged of this curse, it is by the onely merite of Christes satisfaction, and not that the sinnes themselues deserue not euerlasting death, though they b

                      neuer so small of their owne nature, by the sentence of Gods curse, which is a iust rewarde for transgression. Heb. 2.
                  The two other places that I cite for this purpose: The soule that sinneth shall dye: Ezech. 18. and, the rewarde of sinne is death: Rom. 6. he will expounde by the saying of saint Iames Chapt. 1. sinne when it is consummate, gendreth death: as though this place of S. Iames denyed sinne, not brought into acte, to deserue death, because shewing that the cause of mens destruction i
                        •
                      in themselues, from the first concupisence to the laste and grosest Acte, hee concludeth that those grosse acts bring a man into eternall death. Our sauiour Christe saith, this is condemnation, that light is come into the worlde, and men haue loued darknes rather then light. Were it not good Logike and Diuinitie also, of this place to conclude, that condemnation perteineth not to men, but where the light offered is refused; or that if Christ had not come, none had ben condemned? Iohn. 3. and likewise, yea much rather, wher Christ saith: If I had not come and spoken vnto them, they shoulde not haue had sinne? Iohn. 15. Were the obstinate Iewes cleare of sinne by Bristowes iudgement, before Christ came? But let vs examine his reason. It is sinne (saith he) as soone as it is gendred, but it gendreth not death so so one as it is gendred: Therefore some sinne there is, that gendreth notd eath. The minor is false, for Sainct Iames, saying that sinne consummat gendreth death, doth not say that sinne gendreth not death, so soone as it is gendred. But beholde yet his impudent wresting of the

scripture, hee addeth also an exception, vnto sinne consummat, that not euery sinne consummat gendreth death, except the matter bee of weight accordingly. For els that the lightnesse of the matter, as an idle worde bringeth not death, hee sufficiently signifieth in saying, that in a weightie matter, the lightnesse or imperfection of consent doth it not. These are his wordes, by which you may see, that without all shame, hee imputeth such sayings to Sainct Iames, as hee can finde neuer a worde in hi
                        •
                     , sounde like such 
                        〈◊〉
                      saying. But this is the manner of heretikes, which learne not all trueth out of the Scriptures to bring their opinion to the scripture, and to inforce the wordes thereof, against all equitie, to signifie and say, whatsoeuer it pleaseth them. Nowe that saint Iames holdeth that euerie sinne deserueth death, I will proue out of his owne saying, by this argument: Whosoeuer is guiltie of all the lawe and commaundements, deserueth eternall death: Whosoeuer offendeth in one, is guiltie of all: therefore whosoeuer offendeth in one, deserueth eternall death. The maior I truste you will graunt: The minor is Sainct Iames cap. 2. Whosoeuer shall keepe the whole lawe, and offende but in one pointe, hee is guiltie of all: Then seeing euerie sinne is a breach of Gods Lawe, as Sainct Iohn affirmeth, Iohn 3. not onely greate sinnes, but also small sinnes, wherein soeuer men offende against the lawe of GOD deserue eternall death, which cannot bee auoyded but by remission for Christes sake: for bee the sinne neuer so small, it is committed against GOD the authour of the Lawe, who thereby hath forbidden all sinnes, which reason the Apostle vseth, to prooue that hee which offendeth in one, is guiltie of all.
                  And therefore the textes by mee alleged doe sufficiently proue, that all sinnes of their owne nature are mortall.

That God remitteth the punishment, with the fault, in respect whereof the punishment is due, I proue by Fulke. Ezek. 18. &amp; 33. where the Lorde promiseth to put away the remembrance of a sinners offences, that truely turneth vnto him, bringing forth the fruits of repentance. Bristow saith, this taketh not place before the daye of iudgment, whereby it would ensue, that to man could haue comfort of his sinnes forgiuen in this life. But he opposeth the sayings of the Prophet, Psal, 24. &amp; 78. Lorde remember not the sinnes of my youth: and, Lorde remember not our olde sinnes: which are the prayers of the penitent, to obtaine forgiuenesse of their sinnes: which once obtained, they say, The Lorde hath remoued our sinnes from vs, as farre as the East is from the West. Psalme 102. That may bee, saith Bristowe, in respect that they bee remoued from eternall damnation, although they haue yet to abide neuer so much temporall punishment. I will proue that to bee false. To bee remoued as farre as the East is from the West, is as farre as may bee: but not to bee remoued from temporall punishment, is not to bee remoued as farre as may bee: therefore it is not to bee remoued as farre as the Easte is from the West. But the whole Psalme, saith Bristowe, is spoken not of the time of our receiuing into Gods fauour by absolution: but of our finall restitution, which shall bee at the later day. What can bee saide more absurdly? Thankes are there giuen to GOD, not onely for spirituall benefites, but also for temporall.
                  The fatherly pytie of GOD towardes vs as his children which keepe his couenant and are mindefull of his commaundements to doe them, is there set forth, which euery man that is not blinde with hereticall malice, will acknowledge to bee extended towarde vs in this life, &amp; therefore also the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and remouing of them as farre as Heauen from earth, and East from West. As for the argument of singing that Psalme in the popishe Church, vppon the feaste of Christs ascension, to proue, that it pertayneth

altogether to the later day, is as good, as it is true,

                  The Prodigall childe Luke 15. hee saithe, is the Gentile receiued by baptisme, who if after baptisme he became prodigall, hee saith, I haue not proued, that being receiued by penaunce, wee must enioyne him no more punishment, then at his other receiuing. Beside that he restrayning this parable onely to Gentiles, comming first to Baptisme, depriueth the faithfull of inestimable comforte, hee neither hath any worde in the scripture so to restrayne it, and the whole contexte is against him. For Saincte Luke sheweth the occasion of the three parables of the loste sheepe, of the loste Groate, and of the prodigall Childe, to haue beene, because the Scribes and Pharisees murmured, that he receiued the Publicanes, and sinners, which all were Iewes and circumcised, yet fallen from the couenant of God by infinite and notorious sinnes: therefore according to right analogie, the lost Childe,

euen as the lost sheepe, and lost Groate, is euerie penitent sinner; the elder brother, as the 99. sheepe, and 9. groates are the Scribes and Pharisees, which through hypocrisy in their owne iudgement, are righteous and neede no repentaunce.
                  To the 2. debters Luke 7. he answereth, that although Christ forgaue them both, yet they both had to be forgiuen after, according to the proportion of their loue. This importeth manifest contradiction, he forgaue all, yet something was not forgiuen. Yea saith Bristowe, Marie had much sinnes forgiuen her, because she loued much, and therefore long after her hartes conuersion, and therefore after her first forgiuenesse, Christe sayeth: Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.
                  This is a strange kinde of reasoning. Christe shewing the cause of Maries great loue, to haue bene for that great sinnes were forgiuen her, expresseth in voyce, that which she before conceiued by faith, that her sinnes were forgiuen her, Ergo after her first forgiuenes, she had need of a second, which she procured by loue. And yet it is more fonde, that in saying to Simon and of Simon the Pharisee: To whom lesse is forgiuen, he loueth lesse, he giueth him to vnderstand, that he owed more then he was aware, and therefore he should increase as Marie did in penitentiall loue. First howe proueth he that Simon was this other detter, to whom lesse was forgiuen? Secondly, admit that he was, howe proueth he, that he should shewe as great penitentiall loue as Marie, seeing his debt was not so great as Maries, and therefore needed not so great a proportion of his loue, according to his owne heresie of merite? Thirdly, when Christe sayeth, To whom lesse is forgiuen he loueth lesse, he speaketh not so much of the quantitie of sinnes, but the acknowledging of them greater or lesser. For he that confesseth great sinnes to be pardoned, acknowledgeth that he is bound to great loue, as Marie did: the Pharisee, who, though his sinnes were as great as Maries, &amp; in GODS sight, by meanes of hypocrisie more abhominable,

yet was so blinded in opinion of his owne righteousnesse, that he sawe them not, and therefore this loue was as colde, as he imagined his sinnes forgiuen to be fewe and small.
                  Thus the historie of the sinneful womans great loue, proueth nothing that punishment remayneth due to be payed after the debt is forgiuen. Whether this woman were Marie Magdalen, as Brîstowe calleth her, I wil not here dispute. Saint Luke giueth her no name.

                        Whether Purgatorie follow vpon this last foundation. Bristowe.
                        
                     
                  
                  The foundation is ouerthrowen, for all sinnes are Fulke. proued to deserue eternall death, and when God pardoneth them, he pardoneth them clearely, as well the punishment as the guiltinesse, for what should he punishe in them that are guiltie of no sinne by his pardon. Therefore where I cited Psalm. 103. That God hath not dealt with vs according to our sinnes, &amp;c. Bristow is driuen to his former shift, that these wordes are spoken of the Prophete onely, for the time of the finall rewarde which I haue confuted before.
                  Concerning those that repent at the houre of death, I sayde they haue rewarde of eternall life, as well as they that repent sooner, by authoritie of the parable Matthew 20. of them that came the last houre, to worke in the vineyarde.
                  Bristow saith, I am deceiued, because I cannot see any iustice in mercie. Yes verily, I see the iustice of God fully answered in Christ, not in the person that needeth mercie, who is pardoned and iustified gratis freely, Rom. 3. &amp; 11. But the spirite of God sayeth, Apoc. 2. that he will giue to euery one of you according to his workes: wherevpō Bristowe inferreth, ye God is not alike good to al, that he hath once shewed mercie vnto, for Christ, to all the baptised. I aunswere that texte is a threatning to Iesabel, &amp; them that commit fornication with her, if they do not repent from their workes. For it foloweth

immediately. But to you I say and the rest in Thyatei
                        ••
                     , yt haue not this doctrine, and which haue not knowen ye deapth of Satan, as they say, I wil not lay vpon you any other burthen, &amp;c. although it be true, that God rewardeth euery man according to his workes, which is in qualitie good or euill, not in quantitie as much or as little as they deserue. What shall I say that Bristowe bringeth in a varietie of pence, contrary to the scope of the parable, &amp; affirmeth the pence to be wages for the working &amp; that also by bargaine? So that eternall life is not the gift of God, neither are men saued by grace &amp; not of workes, in his iudgement, contrary to the Apostles plaine doctrine. Eph. 2.
                  In the conclusion he saith, If you can prooue that God will shewe as full mercie also where he findeth not that fulnesse of Christes grace, then call vs hardly enimies, for not suffering God to shewe mercie to whom he will. But where wanteth that fulnesse of Christes grace, in any of Gods electe? Is it where greatest sinnes be? The Apostle answereth, where sinne hath abounded, grace hath more then abounded. Rom. 5. Wherfore the fulnesse of the grace of Christ being extended to the greatest sins, what should we doubt that the lesser should not be swallowed vp of it?

                        Whether in Christ the workes of one may helpe another. Bristowe.
                        
                     
                  
                  I saide Purg. 198. I haue learned in the scripture, that Fulke. there is no name giuen vnder heauen, by whiche they may be helped, which are not helped by Christes death, Act. 4. Bristowe asketh whether I haue learned, that they which are helped by the death of Christe, can not through his grace helpe and be holpen one of an other.
                  To whom I aunswere as I saide before, to Allen: I learne in scripture, that the bloud of Christe purgeth vs from all sinne, Iohn. 1. But if there be any which are not purged of all their sinnes, by the bloud of Christe, (as the Papistes affirme them to be which haue neede of other purgation) I haue not learned that they can haue

any helpe elsewhere. Or if you say, the bloud of Christ h
                        •
                     th purged them from all sinne, why doe you invent another purgatory to purge them, which is not ye bloud of Christ? for fierie torments according to Gods iustice are not the bloud of Christ shed for our redemption, by which men are iustified freely, Rom. 3. through which we haue remission of our sinnes through the riches of his grace. Eph. 1.
                  Another reason of mine is grounded vpon Allens wordes, which saith: that they which are in purgatory, cā not by any motion of minde, attaine more mercie, then their life past deserued. Whereof I inferre, that their faith being a notable motion of the minde, cannot profite them, except the merites of other men should profite them without faith, the Scripture saying, that without faith, it is not possible to please God. Bristowe icsting at these iron conclusions, letteth the argument stand, and denyeth the latter conclusion, affirming that by their faith, they are in case to be profited by other mens workes: which if it be true, then is Allens conclusion false, that they can not profite them selues, by any motion of minde, whereon it will followe that they cannot profite them selues by beleeuing, that other mens workes may helpe them, beeing destitute of their owne. They cannot atteine mercie by any motion of minde, Ergo not by faith.

                        Fulkes common argument of the Omnisufficiencie of Christes Bristowe. passion.
                     
                  
                  As though I defended the onely omnipotencie of Fulke. Christes passion able to purge al sinnes, and not the omnisufficiencie hauing satisfied for our sinns, first he replyeth, that an Origenist might likewise say, The omnisufficiencie of Christes passion cannot stande with hell.
                  No sir, for against him, is not onely the wil of Christ, but his Act also past, hauing sufficiently onely for his elect: which satisfaction he communicateth vnto them, not in respecte of their workes, but according to his

grace, whiche can abide no workes to ioyne with it in merite, but onely faith in receiuing confirmed by the sacramentes in the persons of all them, that heare his word, and in them that cannot heare, only his grace working either in the sacrament or without it: so that no degrees, proportions, meanes or instruments, wherof Bristow babbleth, can make any merite to detract from Christs death, ye most plentiful &amp; free grace of satisfactiō, for all our sins cōmitted either before baptisme, or after.
                  For this purpose, I cited 1. Iohn. 2. Pur. 42. to proue that if any man sinne after baptisme, Iesus Christ is our Advocate with the father, and the propitiation for our sinnes. Bristow answereth, That is true, But that in playing the Advocate for our sinnes after baptisme, he request
                           •
                        th the like &amp; equal grace, as he did in baptisme for sinnes afore baptisme, where haue you that? If you make Christes advocation a playing matter, I will take no charge of you. But to let passe your vnreuerent phrase, what doe you ascribe vnto him in his office of advocate, but onely to be a requester, as euery common Saint is counted with you? But you must vnderstande, that the office of an Advocate or patrone is, to pleade for his clientes, and not to require only, and what hath he to pleade for vs against ye debte of our sins, either before or after baptism but his owne satisfaction in his death &amp; suffering? And therefore euen that which you aske, where I haue i
                        •
                      I haue euen in the very same words, yt he requesteth as an advocate, for our sins after baptisme the like and equall grace, as he did in Baptisme for sinns afore baptisme. For there I finde him a propitiation for our sinnes committed after baptisme, which word I maruel your blind heresie could not see, whereof I reason thus. The same propitiation, as course of grace working after baptisme, that was in or before baptisme, must haue equall effectes of grace: But Christ is ye same propitiation after Baptisme that he was in it, or before: Ergo he must haue the same effectes of grace, working the satisfaction of our sinnes euen at the full.

                     ie, whensoeuer we acknowledge them with hartie repentance; what place is left for any other purging or clensing of that, which the bloud of Christ and the mercie of God hath made pure and cleane?
                  That I cite out of S. Iohn, being washed by Christ, we are throughly cleane. Iohn 13. &amp; out of Esay: Although our sinnes were as red as scarlet, they are made as white as snowe: He answereth these places are euident of baptisme. And therefore he admitteth that I sayd of them so clensed, that they are made capable immediatly of the heauenly inheritance. But why, I pray you, are they euident of baptisme? because there is mention of washing in both places? Is there no washing but in baptisme? At least wise, will you saye, that the Prophet Esay preaching to the people of his age, when hee called them to washing, called them to baptisme, so manye hundreth yeares before baptisme was instituted? Is it not therefore euident, that hee calleth them to repentaunce? Or else, hauing

first so grieuously accused them of their present sinnes, doeth he shewe no comfort, but in the sacramēt of baptisme, which no man liuing could then possibly obteine in such manner as you meane, no not the Prophet him selfe. I might well say to you, as you say to mee in another place, In good sooth Dauus, these things are not aptly diuided according to their times. And that Christ Iohn. 13. speaketh not of the ceremonie of baptisme, it i
                        •
                      manifest by diuerse reasons, but of his grace by which he washeth vs from all our sinnes. And therefore be sayth to Peter, except he were washed of him, he coulde haue no part with him. But neither Peter, nor any other was or is baptised of him with water: Iohn 4. therfore he speaketh not of the sacrament of baptisme. And where you adde, that he which is so washed, must neuerthelesse wash his feete, that is, say you, his veniall sinnes, which he committeth afterwarde, although he continue withall in the cleannesse of baptisme, before he be all cleane, and aske mee, what if he dye before he wash his feete? Admitting that the feete should signifie none but veniall sinnes. I aske you againe, who shall wash his feete, but he which washed Peters feet? for the true text is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , he hath no neede but that his feete be washed. Peter could not wash his owne feete in this figuratiue signification, but except Christ did wash him he could haue no part with him. But if we should take the feete onely for veniall sinnes, and the generall washing for baptisme, this inconuenience would follow of Christes wordes: that he which is baptised and purged from veniall sinnes, neede no purgation to clense him from mortall sinnes, but is perfectly cleare. The wordes of our sauiour are generall, &amp; cannot admitt your exception, of continuing in the cleannesse of baptisme: therefore the feete signifie all sinnes to be pardoned, after the first grace purging vs, which is in deede represented and ratified in baptisme, but yet is perfectly distinct from the sacrament, and often times deuided. For Iudas of whome you speake, if he had dyed immediatly after he was baptised, should not haue

gone to heauen, as one throughly washed or clensed by

As though there were no working of our saluation, but by satisfaction for our sinnes. Wee worke our saluation, when we walke in the way that God hath called vs to passe through, vnto the free gift of eternall life, namely in faith, obedience, thankfulnes, &amp;c. which are so farre from merite, that it is God which worketh in vs, both to will and to perfourme any good thing, according to his good pleasure. Phil. 2. And therefore wee neede not the schoole distinction of causes, for the satisfaction of our sinnes by our workes, which is onely the effect of Christes death and passion, needing no helpe of our workes,

which worde (Bristowe sayth) mine ignorance so much abhorreth, and yet the scripture often sayth, that God helpeth both Christ, Ps. 17. &amp; vs. 2. Cor. 2. Heb. 13. and also that Christs helpeth vs, Heb. 2. But where sayeth the Scripture, that our workes helpe the passion of Christ? I abhorre not the worde of helping, when it is vsed in that sense, that God and Christ should helpe vs; or God helpe Christ in respect of his humanitie: but that man by merite should helpe God &amp; Christ, in the worke of our redemption, satisfaction for our sinnes, or purging of them, I abho

                     ery one will imagine, but as it may stande with his iustice, which is not otherwise satisfied, but in the passion of Christ: which being thereby fully satisfied, we exclude nothing that the scripture admitteth, but that which not onely the scripture denyeth, but nature it selfe abhorreth, that contradictories should be both true: Namely, the iustice of God is fully satisfied by the onely suffering of Christ: And the iustice of god is not satisfied by the onely sufferings of Christ, but by other meanes also, as by our own workes, or suffrings, or other mens for vs. Neither doeth any text of scripture that Bristowe citeth, proue this later part of the contradiction to be true. First, where he citeth Tit. 3. He hath saued vs by the lauer of regeneration: The text is, when the louing kindnesse &amp; gentlenes of God our sauiour appeared, not of the works of righteousnes, which we wrought, but according to his owne mercy, he hath saued vs, by the lauer of regeneration and the receiuing of the holy ghost, which he hath powred foorth plentifully vpon vs by Iesus Christ our sauiour, that being iustified by his grace, we might be made heires according

Secondly, although we be all made priests, yet we are not made high priests, of which the text speaketh. Heb. 5. which office one only can enioy at one time, which is our sauiour Christ, for terme of his life, which is without end. Thirdly, those sacrifices which the externall priest offered for sinnes, could neuer take away sinnes, Heb. 10. much lesse our spirituall sacrifices of thanksgiuing for Gods benefites bestowed on vs, &amp; his whole church. I cited further. Apoc. 7. These are they yt came out of yt great affliction, &amp; haue washed their stoles, and made them white in ye bloud of the lamb: therfore they are in ye presence of ye throne of god. Brist. saith, this word

therefore, is referred to their comming out of affliction, and so whited their stoles: And yet this gloser (saith he of me) taketh it away from the affliction, whereas that whiting was nothing else but that affliction. O impudent and blasphemous heretike: when the holy ghost expressely sayeth, they made their stoles white in the bloud of the lamb, darest thou open thy mouth and saye, not only, that that whiting was somewhat else then the bloud of Christ, but also that it was nothing but that affliction, so vtterly excluding the bloud of Christ? But I forgot to conferre other places of scripture, as he chargeth me. Is there any scripture that ascribeth purification of our sinnes, to any other thing, than to the bloud of Christ? Let vs heare what, whoso ouercommeth, shalbe clothed with white garments. Apoc. 3. But the Martyrs ouercame the diuell, not onely by the blood of the lambe, but also by their owne patient confession, or affliction vnto death. Apoc. 12. The text is: and they ouercame him by the bloud of the lambe, and by the word of their testimonie, and they loued not their liues vnto death. Here is no cause of victorie, but the bloud of the lambe, and the worde of their testimonie, which was the confession of their faith, the onely instrumentall cause of their iustification and victorie: who is he which ouercommeth the world, sayth S. Iohn, but he that beleueth? 1. Iohn 5. Faith therefore the onely shilde to haue victory against the worlde and the diuell, hath no power in it selfe to clense our sinnes, but leaneth altogether to the bloud of Christ. But it is a proper thing to see Bristow forsake his vulgar latine authenticall translation, and to turne

                     : and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      should be taken for suffering of death, as I thinke it is in no Greeke author, sure I am it is neuer so taken in the newe testament.
                  But Bristow addeth: that S. Paul also accordingly calleth it the mortification of Iesus, when the Apostles were mortifyed

for Iesus, and sayeth they carryed the same about continually in their bodies, that also the life of Iesus might also be manifected in their bodies, 2. Cor. 4. I wot well, wee must be conformable to Christ in sufferings, that we may be partakers of his kingdome and glorie: but doeth it therefore followe, that our sufferings merit this glorie by his bloud? or that his bloud without all respect of our merites, doeth not alone purge and clense vs from all our sinnes? After he had finished the cleansing of our sinnes by his owne selfe, sayeth the Apostle, he is set downe at the right hande of magnificence in the highest. Heb. 1.
                  Last of all, Bristowe opposeth that Saint Paul sayth: This our affliction although it be but short and light, worketh vs euerlasting weight of glory exceeding measure aboue measure. 2. Cor. 4. I answere, it worketh not by meriting, not by purging our sinnes, or by satisfying for our iniquities, but by making vs conformable vnto our head, in passing by the same way of tribulatiōs vnto glorie, that he did, euen as the way or steppes which leadeth vnto an high place of dignitie, maketh not them worthie of the dignitie that must ascende by those steppes vnto it, and yet it is necessarie for them that will come to that dignitie, to sit in such places, to take that ordinary way. Therefore as the passage of such way worketh their dignitie, so doeth affliction worke our glory. Not to abridge any part of the glorie or merite of Christes suffering, by which onely wee are made worthie of glory when all our sinnes being cleansed by his bloud, wee appeare righteous before God, not in the merite of our owne workes, nor hauing our owne righteousnes, which is by the lawe, but the righteousnesse of God, which is by faith of Iesus Christ, that wee may knowe him of the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable vnto his death, Phil. 3. Wherefore it remaineth, that seeing the bloud of Christ purgeth vs of all our sinnes, and Iesus Christ is ye propitiation for our sinnes, committed either after baptisme or before, that all other purgings and satisfactiōs are ouerthrowen, and so popish purgatorie remaineth

without any foundation: the purging of Christs bloud making vs most pure: and Christ our propitiation being throughly &amp; only sufficient to reconcile vs.
                  
                     Secondly: directly of Purgatorie it selfe &amp; prayer for the 
                     Bristowe. 
                     dead, whether all the elect goe streight to heauen. Afore Christes comming Limbus patrum.
                  
                  His childish rayling on mine argumentes, with that Fulke. impudent slaunder of all the church of God, which he affirmeth was ignorant that any soules went to heauen before their church had defined it, within these 300. yeres, I passe ouer, &amp; come to the matter in question. I said Purg. 57. against Allen, mainteining that all the iust before Christ were punished for their sinnes forgiuē ma ny hundreth yeres after their departure in hel. That the fathers of the olde testament before Christ were not in hell, it is to be proued with manifest arguments &amp; autorities out of holy scriptures. Although they were not, nor yet are in perfect blessednes, God prouiding a better thing for vs, that they without vs, shuld not be made perfect. Heb. 11. But by this text (saith Brist.) S. Paul doth meane, yt their soules were not yet admitted into heauen. How proueth he that? forsooth, the old testament did consummate nothing, &amp;c. but their sinnes remaining not perfectly remitted, Christ died, &amp;c. A sore bolt, as though any man had his sinnes forgiuen, but by the new testament, or could be heire of the kingdom of heauen, but by ye death of Christ. But the same apostle saith. Heb 9. That the way of the saints, was not yet opened, while the first tabernacle stood. Bristow addeth to the text of his own, into soncta or heauen: wher the apostle meaneth of the worke of Christs redemption in his death, resurrection &amp; ascension, the effect wherof, neuertheles was extended no lesse to the fathers of yt olde testament, then to vs. Thirdly, the apostle saith, Heb. 10. that we haue confidence to enter in to the holy place, by the bloud of Iesus, which hath dedicated yt new &amp; liuing way for vs, through the vayle that is his flesh. All which proueth nothing, but that there is no entrance into heauen, but by Christ, which way is comon to all ye saintes of God, of all ages. But Bristow biddeth me conferre the

end of my text. Heb. 11. with the beginning: where he saith, they receiued not ye promise which is the expositiō of their not consummating: I admit it: for no Christian receiueth the promise consummate before the resurrection of their bodies. The consummation of which promise, &amp; perfection of the saints, God reserueth vnto one time, when we shal all receiue the promise &amp; consummation together: that they without vs (saith he) shoulde not be consummate, the same reason is of the apostles &amp; fathers of the primitiue church, &amp; vs of the later church, &amp; them yt shalbe to ye end of the world. Now to mine arguments &amp; autorities of scripture. I reason, that seeing they all beleeued in Christ, they had euerlasting life, &amp; entred not into condemnation, but passed frō death to life. Ioh. 5. To what life (saith Bristow) but the life or resurrection of their bodies? for vntil the last day, all the dead are in death. O prodigious heretike, call you that a passage frō death to life, to continue in death 5. or 6. thousād years? Is God then to this new Saducee, the god of the dead &amp; not of the liuing? yea, he saith, yt life after corporal deth in ye new testament, lightly euery where, signifieth ye resurrection of the bodies. What is it then to take hold of eternall life in this world, which shalbe interrupted wt so long abyding in death? 1. Tim. 6. And how can it be true which our sauiour saith: he that beleueth in me, hath alreadie eternal life, if they yt are passed out of this world are all in death? wherfore then is this eternall life interupted with any Purgatorie, Limbus patrum, or death.
                  The second argument is, of that Christ is called the lamb that was slaine from the beginning of the worlde; because the benefite of his passion extendeth vnto the godly of all ages alike. Apoc. 13. To this, the beast hath nothing to answere, but yt it is not said, that the lambe was slaine from the beginning of the world: but that all the reprobates shal adore antichrist whē he cometh. And because Apoc. 17. the words be: whose names were not written in the booke of life frō the beginning of the world: he would haue those wordes from the beginning of the world, by a monstrous construction, contrary to the

manifest composition and pointing, both in the Greeke &amp; vulgare Latine, to be referred not to the lamb slaine, but to the booke of life. As though both those textes in their seuerall sense might not be true, except such manifest violence were offered to the construction cō
                     position &amp; pointing in this text of ye Apoc. Yet he confesseth it to be true, that ye lambe was slaine from the beginning of the world, which is no where else written in the scripture, but heere: the cause of the trueth, he will not haue to be my fonde sense, but because his death was preordeined of God, and prefigured so long before. A substantiall cause by which we may say, that Bristowe was dead from the beginning of the world, because his death was so long before ordeined of God, and prefigured in the death of Adam.
                  The third argument is, that Esay speaking of yt righteous that are departed out of this life, sayeth that there is peace, and that they shall rest in their beddes, Esa. 57. like as he affirmeth that Topheth which is Gehinnon, or hell, is prepared of olde for the wicked. To this he answereth, that Esay speaketh not of his owne time, but as a Prophet, of the time now since the cōming of Christ, who is our peace, as though Christ were not their peace as well as oures. And what a shamelesse answere is this, to denye the doctrine of the Prophet concerning the comfort of the faithfull after death, to perteine to the faithfull of his owne time, to whome then it was in vaine preached and published by the Prophet? After a little quarreling against my translatiō, the sense wherof he cannot deny: he asketh, if the rest of the soules must needes be the blisse of heauen? and telleth vs that their Limbus was not a place of sensible paine: But sir, Salom whereinto the Prophet sayeth the righteous doe goe, will not onely giue them rest, without sense of paine: but peace with happinesse and prosperitie. Finally, he sayeth, Topheth or Gehenna, was not the onely hell, because our Creede and the Scripture sayeth, that Christes soule was in hell: I answere, that hell signifyeth either the place, or state of torments for sinnes: in the former,

Caluine (whome you slaunder) sayth not that Christ was in, but in the later, when he complained that he was forsaken of God: there is not therefore proued, by Christes discending into hell, any other place or receptacle of soules in hell, but Topheth and Gehenna ye place of the damned.
                  The fourth argument against Limbus, is, that Lazarus was carryed by Angels, not downe to hell, but vp to Abrahams bosome. But the riche man being in hell, looked vp and seeth Abraham afarre of. Bristowe asketh whether 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      signifie to be carryed vp? sir, it signifieth to be carried away, and seeing the riche man looking vp, seeth Lazarus afarre of, it followeth that Lazarus was carried vp and not downe. But you reply, it foloweth not that he was carryed into heauen. Then you may say he was carried vp to hell. But the places you say might be nigh together in respect of the distance of heauen, although one were vpwarde, and also farre off both in state and situation (purgatorie peraduenture betwixt them.) This is a goodly faith, that standeth vpon peraduenture, and this may be, &amp;c. The Scripture saith, ther was a great Chaos which is an infinite distance betweene them, which cannot agree to Limbus, which must be harde adioyning to hell, or else it is not Limbus. But if they were no way nigh together (sayth he) it will not followe that Abrahams bosome was heauen. I answere, if they were no way nigh together, it could not be hell, nor Limbus of hell, which is the thing I was to proue. Also the text is plaine, that Abrahams bosome was a place of comfort. And other place of comfort then heauen or Paradise, which is all one, for the soules departed, I finde none in Scripture.
                  The last argument is this: If righteousnesse belong to Abrahams children, the rewarde of righteousnesse also perteineth to them. Therefore Abrahams bosome was open to receiue all the childrem of Abraham, euen as the bosome of God was readie to receiue Abraham, because he was his sonne through faith.
                  Heere Bristowe noteth no small blasphemie, proceeding

of grosse ignorance, saying, That which is proper to vnigenitus, the onely begotten sonne of God, hee maketh common to Abraham. Why Bristowe? because vnigenitus is eternally, and after his proper manner, in the bosome of the father, doth it thereof followe, that none can be in the bosom of GOD, but the proper place of Christ is made common to them? You threaten in the 12. Chapter oftentimes to bewray my grosse ignorance in the scriptures, and haue you such fine knowledge in them, that you coulde not see what Esay writeth Chap. 40. according to your owne translation, Ecce dominus Deus, &amp;c. Beholde the Lorde God shall come in strength, and his arme shall haue the dominion: beholde his rewarde is with him, and his worke before him: As a sheepheard hee will feede his flocke, hee will gather the Lambes together on his arme and beare them in his bosome: in sin
                           •
                         suo leuabit? Beholde you greate and mightie doctours in the scriptures, the bosome of GOD as of a shephearde, is open to receiue all his Lambes; howe much more as a father to receiue his children? But to the argument you aunswere: The rewarde of righteousnesse may belong to one, and yet not payed him, as soone as hee dyeth. Saincte Paule saying expresly of Abraham and many of his children, that they departed not receiuing the promises, but beholding them a farre off: and all these renouned by faith, receiued not the promise. That is (saith Bristowe) the inheritance, the rewarde of righteousnesse: I replye, the rewarde of righteousnesse cannot belonge to one, but it must bee payed him as soone as it is payed vnto others, to whome the same rewarde, vppon the same cause belongeth: therefore seeing it is payed to some immediately after their death, it is likewise to all. That manie dyed not receiuing the promises, is partelie vnderstoode of the promises of the lande of Canaan, partelye of the full fruition and perfection of rewarde, which to all men is denyed before the laste

iudgement, and so no inequalitie or vniustice vnto any.

                        Whether since Christ all goe straight Bristowe. to heauen.
                     
                  
                  They that liue vnto Christe, dye vnto him, and being Fulke. disolued are with him. The soules of the faithfull and the repentant are where Christ is, as hee prayeth 
                        •
                     oan 17. so hee saith to the theefe, no perfecte iuste

                     an, but a sinner repentaunt, This day thou shalt 
                        •
                     ee with mee in Paradise, Luke 23. And Saincte P
                        •
                     ule desireth to bee dissolued and to bee with Christ.
                  To leaue his iugling of seeing Christes godheades glorie, and manhoodes glorie, whereof I speake no worde, hee confesseth the example of Sainct Paul declareth, that a per
                        •
                     ect iust man goeth straight to Christ: Likewise the example if the theefe declareth, that a penitent sinner, goeth straight to Christ, if either his penaunce bee full and perfect, or his pardon, which is a remission of his penance be plenarie. By this you perceiue that penance with him is taken for punishment satisfactory, and not for repentaunce of the hearte and true conuersion vnto GOD: But there is a plenarie pardon and satisfaction for all sinnes giuen to euerie penitent sinner: therefore euery penitent sinner goeth streight to Christ whom we knowe and beleeue to be in heauen. The minor is proued, by sainct Iohn, 1. Iohn 2. Iesus Christ is our aduocate and propitiation for our sinnes. The bloude of Iesus Christe doth purge vs from all sinnes.
                  Secondly hee saith, I allude to a place, Romans 14. wee liue to our Lorde, and wee die to our Lord: whereby nothing else is ment, but that hee is our iudge in life and death. A bare exposition, if wee haue no more comforte by liuing to the Lorde, then that hee shall bee our iudge at our death. Howe be it I grounde not myne argument onelye, of that phrase, to

controll Augustines exposition of them that die in the Lorde, Apoca. 14. for martyrs onely, as you slaunder mee, but compare other places of the faithfull, that are asleepe in Christ, 1. Corin. 15. And they that are deade in Christ, 1. Thessalonians 4. where the phrases being all one, with that of Apoca. 14. blessed are the deade that dye in the Lorde, that text cannot bee restrained onely to the blessednesse of martyrs, but extendeth to the happinesse of all that are deade in the Lorde, which are all the faithfull. But the circumstance of the place (saith Bristowe) giueth it to bee meant of martyrs. I aunswere, there is no circumstance that can proue it to bee spoken onely of Martyrs) seeing the argument of their blessednesse, is dying in the Lorde, whiche is common to all the faithfull, therefore blessednesse also, and that is the iudgement of S. Augustine de ciu. dei lib. 20 Cap. 9. whatsoeuer Allen or you prate to the contrarie. For after the text rehearsed he writeth thus vpon it. Reg. nat itaque: 
                     The Church therefore nowe first reineth with Christ in the lyuing, and in the deade. For therefore (as the Apostle saith) Christ dyed, that he shoulde be Lorde ouer the liuing and ouer the deade. But therefore he named onely the soules of the Martyrs, because they as the chiefe, reigne being deade, which vnto death striued for the truthe. But by a part we vnderstand the whole, euen the rest that are deade pertaining to the Church which is the kingdom of Christ.

                  My first argument he maketh of the true falling to the North or South and so resting, which in deede is Fulke. no argument of myne, neither doe I thinke the texte Eccle 11. to be vnderstoode of the state of men after this life: onely I shew that Allen by his glosses, hath not satisfied them that so expounde it, of whom one is S. Hierom. Purg, 436. 439. 441. Indeede Purg 281. I said, immediately after death (as M. Allen confesseth) followeth iudgement, but prayers either neede not or boote not,

                     ut the authoritie of the scriptures, we may imagine what we will.

As for them that lacke the rewarde of their bodie, it

                     ll the saincts of God together. As for the martyrs, Apoc. 6, I finde they complayned for iustice against their murtherers, I finde not that they prayed for the reward of their body: which complaint is to be vnderstoode rather of the desert of the wicked persecuters then of the affection of the holy martyrs. The bloude of Abel cried vengaunce, yet Abel patiently suffered death. The

differences of punishment for being angrie saying

                  Another argument is out of Matth. 7. of the two wayes, if there bee but two wayes in this life, there are but two abiding places after this life. To this Bristowe aunswereth, although the argument bee not mine, but an obiection that Allen taketh on him to aunswere: First that in the wide way some goe wider then some, with infinite varietie, but all to damnation presently: Secondly in the narrowe way, some goe narrower then some with infinite varietie, yet all in the narrowe way: Ergo say I, all straight to saluation. Although in a way so narrowe, that it is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                      thrusting way, or a way, whose sides are thrust together, that there shoulde bee such infinite varietie of narrownesse, which must also import an infinite widenes, it is against all reason, and the worde of the texte. Wherefore it cannot bee the way of merites but of faith.
                  Another argument is of the text 2. Cor. 5. We shall all stande before the iudgement seate of Christ, that euerie one may receiue in his bodie according to such things as he hath done either good or euill. Therefore the prayers or deedes of other men helpe not. To this he aunswereth out of Augustine, that the deade in our Lorde, hath in his life deserued, that these workes after his death might be profitable to him. Against which authoritie, he saith, I haue no reply, to maintain that scripture against such prayer, but onely oppose a saying of Hierom. I think the scripture it selfe is a sufficient replie against all authoritie of man. Euerie man shall receiue according to his owne workes, and not according to the workes of other men, as for the deserte of man, it is

nothing but vnto damnation. And yet that argument is

                      iustice, which as you holde, requireth satisfaction by temporall punishment. For otherwise we know it standeth both with his iustice, and his mercie, yt they whiche obteine forgiuenes of their sinnes by Christ, should immediately after their death be receiued into the fellowshippe of them that are likewise made righteous by him. Augustine is quoted De Ciu. Dei. lib. 21. Cap. 24. where the question is moued, but not answered, and yet the place is corrupted and inforced, as Ludovicus Vives confesseth. In that Chapter Augustine reasoneth, against them which helde that God after the iudgement, would release all the damned at the prayers of his saints. In the 27. Chapter, which he also quoteth, there is nothing to the question.

                  This argument is gathered Pur. 381. If it be against the hope of Christians, to mourne for the deade, much Fulke. more it is against the hope and faith of Christians, to pray for them. For by our prayer, we suppose them

                      shewed, and I haue shewed the contrary, that they

                  This argument (saith Bristow) supposeth, that the

For they yt are in Purgarorie, neither deserue nor sinne, by your owne confession. As for the sinne against the holy Ghost, which we say is not to be prayed for at all, he threateneth often, to consute in the 12. Chapter. In the meane time it is euident that Purgatorie for any thing that is hitherto applyed by Bristow, remaineth confuted by sufficient argumentes and authoritie of the Scriptures.

                        The fourth parte concerning all other questions, that he mentioneth Bristowe. and first of good workes in generall, Iustification, &amp; Free will.
                     
                  
                  Remitting the questions of the witnesses of Gods Fulke. worde, vnto fiue motives in the 10. Chapter: where I alledge that good workes do not iustifie two places, one of Saint Paul, another of Esaie, he holdeth the contrary, that works do iustifie. And first calling me a falsary, because I recite not the very wordes of the Apostle, which was not my purpose, but to shew what we do affirme out of that texte of the Apostle, he saith, iustification by workes, is not denied by that text of Saint Paule, Rom. 3. We holde that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the lawe, for it is to be vnderstoode of workes going before Baptisme, and not of workes following

                     orkes and not of faith onely. To this I aunswere

                     e saved vs by baptisme: Bristowe asketh, if I marke the temps. Yea, very well, he speaketh of workes before faith. And doth it therefore followe, that works done after faith, doe iustifie? Saint Paule extendeth the saluation (which is sealed vnto vs by the lauer of newe birth, and renewing of the holy Ghoste, which he hath poured richly vpon vs by Iesus Christ our sauiour, vnto eternall life: therefore it followeth, that beeing iustified by his grace, we might be made heires according to the hope of eternall life. Vpon the 2. text Es. 64. I saide: the Popish Church is not content to be clothed in the white shining silke, which is the iustification of Saintes, made white in the bloud of the lambe, but with the filthy ragges of mannes righteousnesse. Bristowe asketh where I learned, to call the good workes done in the Church, the filthy ragges of mans righteousnesse?

Verily, euen of Esaie who speaketh in the person of the Church: All we are as an vncleane person, and all our righteousnesse, as filthy ragges. For although God accept our workes, that are done in faith, and pardon their imperfection, yet when they are obtruded vnto him, to iustifie vs, he abhorreth them, as in the Pharisee Luke 18. That the iustifications of the Saintes. Apoc. 19. are good workes, Bristowe would haue it appeare by conference of 1. Iohn. 3. He that worketh iustice is iust, where he reasoneth of the effectes of a iust man, &amp; not of the cause. No flesh is iust by workes of the law, but by faith, by which God maketh iust, euen the vngodly man. But how much better conference is it, to know, what the white 
                        〈◊〉
                      meaneth, which is the iustification of Saintes, to compare it with other places of the same prophecie, as Apoc. 7. where it is shewed, howe the stoles of the faithful are made white, with the bloud of the lambe, and with the place of Saint Paule shewing how the Church is made white, and without spotte and wrinckle by the death of Christ? Ephe. 5.
                  Touching freewill, I saide, we beleeue, that man after his fall, hath not free will, no not aptnesse of will to thinke any thing that is good. 2. Cor. 3. Bristow translateth the worde, we are not sufficient, but the text is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                      aptnes, is of God. To this Bristowe replyeth, that naturall free will is not taken from vs, nor naturall aptnes of will. I hope he speaketh like a Philosopher, and not like a flat Pelagian. But I speake as a Christian of the fredome of mans will vnto good, which is none but bondage vnto euill, except he be regenerate, and then is his will framed of God in parte, to good, but not perfectly in this life, as regeneration is not perfectly finished before the redemption of our bodies: as for freedome opposite to coaction, if Bristowe meane that, by reteyning of free will, I graunt euery mans will to be free from constreint, but not from seruilitie vnto sinne. Whereof Saint complaineth, Rom 7.

                  Concerning inuocation of Saints, I saide Purg. 451. Fulke. wee call not vpon Saints, because we beleeue not in thē: for how should wee call vpon them in whom wee beleue not? Rom. 10. To this (reseruing a pretended contradiction to the proper place) he saith: first that Saint Paule, did often inuocate &amp; call vppon the faithfull, beseching them to pray for him, which is a toye to mocke with an Ape, for Saint Paule did not inuocate or pray to them as vnto them that knewe his hearte, and could helpe his greefe, but onely of charitie desireth their prayers. Secondly he asketh, where is any Scripture, that we must beleeue in God onely? Forsooth, amongst many, this shal suffice, which is written in Ieremie Cap. 17. Cursed is the man that trusteth in man,

and maketh flesh his arme, and his heart departeth from the Lord. But that it is lawfull to bêleue in Saints also, Bristowe quoteth Exod. 14. where it is said, the people beleeued God, and Moses his seruant, as though there were no difference betweene giuing credite to Gods Prophets, and beleeuing in them, which is to put our trust in them. The like I saie to the seconde place, quoted 2. Par. 20. where Iosaphat promiseth all things prosperous to the people, if they giue credite to Gods Prophets, Credite Prophetis eius. But forlaking his vulgar authentical translation, he prouoketh vs to the Hebrue, belyke because of the preposition, beth, which is a miserable shift: Seing the Hebrue phrase is well knowen, to differ from the Latine, and English phrase, and especially from the sense of beleuing, that is trusting in God, which is peculiar to him and ought not to be in any creature, which is not God.
                  He quoteth also Philemon, whose loue &amp; faith the Apostle commendeth towardes the Lorde Iesu, and towards all his Saints, where euerie wise man seeth that faith is referred to Christ, and loue to the Saints. But the scripture reacheth him to beleeue (he saith) in Christ according to his humanity and namely in his blood. Iohn. 14. Rom. 3. He will proue an Arian or a Nestorian shortly. The place of Iohn proueth the diuinity of Christ, because he is to be beleeued on, euen as God. And where the Apostle saith, that God hath made Christ a propitiation through faith in his blood, he meaneth not that we must beleue in the blood of Christ, as it is a creature, but that the death and bloodshedding of Christ, is the meane of our reconciliation vnto God. But the Nicene Creede &amp; Hieronyme, contra Lucif. vse the phrase of Credere in Ecclesiam, to beleeue in the Church. I answere, they meane no more thereby, then they which vse the distinction Credere in Deum, Credere Deo, &amp; Credere Deum, which Bristowe saith hath deceiued me. Augustine (as Bristowe confesseth) maketh it proper to God, that we beleeue in him
                  We beleeue not in Peter, we beleeue not in Paule.

In Iohn. 129. Neither saith the Nicene Creede, or Hieronyme contrary thereto, that we should put our whole trust and confidence in the Church, but in God only. Therfore although they speak otherwise then Augustine, they meane not otherwise then he. Ruffinus also in his exposition of the Creede, writeth both plainly and effectually: 
                        Sequitur namque post, &amp;c. For it followeth after this saying: The holy Catholique Church, the remission of sinnes, the resurrection of the bodie: he saith not in the holy Catholique Church, in the remission of sinnes, in the resurrection of the fleshe. For if he had added, the preposition, In, the sense should haue bene made one, and the same with the former articles. But euen in those termes truly, where faith is ordered of the diuinitie, it is saide, in God the father, and in Christ his sonne, and in the holy Ghost. But in the rest, where the speach is not of the Godhead, but of creatures and the mysteries, the preposition, In, is not added, that it should be said we must beleeue in the holy Church, but the holy Church: not as God, but as the Church gathered into God. And that men should beleue, that there is remission of sinnes, not in the remission of sinnes, that they should beleeue the resurrection of the body, not in the resurrection of the body. Therefore by this syllable of the Preposition, the Creator is distinguished from the creatures, and things diuine, are separated from things humane.
                  
                  Neuerthelesse, Bristowe saith, they beleue both in God, in Christ and in his Saints, and inuocate them all, though not all alyke, but then let him heare, what Cyprian saith, 
                        De duplici Martyrio. Non credit in Deum, qui non in eo solo collocat totius faelicitatis suae fiduciam. He beleueth not in God, which placeth not in him alone, the hope of his whole felicity. Whervpon it followeth, yt they which beleeue in saints, &amp; place some part of their hope of felicite in thē, &amp; not in God alone, by his iudgment, &amp; by ye iudgment of ye Apostle also beleeue not in God. Where I said, if Saints also are to be inuocated, then God alone knoweth not the heartes of all men,

and God onely is not to be worshipped and serued, and Christ is not our onely Mediatour and Aduocate: Bristowe calleth it iangling, without allegations. I supposed these principles had bene sufficiently knowen to euerie learned Papist, without allegations, but seeing Bristowe will not take knowledge of them, because he knoweth not how to shift his handes of them. For the first, my allegation shall be 1. Reg. 8. Salomon in his prayer sayth vnto God: What prayers or supplications shalbe made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when euerie one shal knowe the plague in his own hart, and stretche foorth his handes in this house, Heare thou then in heauen in thy dwelling place, and be merciful, and doe and giue euery man according to all his wayes as thou knowest his heart, for thou onely knowest the harts of al the children of men. For the second, that God only is to be worshiped and serued, it is the saying of our sauiour Christ, Math. 4. &amp; Luk 4. Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him only shalt thou serue.
                  That Christe onely is our Mediator and Aduocate, Saint Paule testifieth 1. Timoth. 2. there is but one God and one mediatour of God and men, the man Iesus Christ, in which place he speaketh of Prayer, supplications, intercessions, &amp;c. to be made for all men. And Saint Iohn 1. Ioh. 2. If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the father Iesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins. But, saith Brist, as I say to Ambrose, &amp; others whom I confesse to be of the true Church, so must I saie it to Saint Iohn Apoc. 1. for inuocating the holy Angells. But I finde not that Iohn did inuocate the holy Angels, in that place, although the seuen spirites from whom he wisheth grace, should not be the holy Ghost, but Angels the ministers of the holy Ghost. For he that prayeth that God will sende raine from heauen, doth not inuocate heauen. But I must saie the same to God him self, for making an Angell to be worshiped as Apoc. 3. as he hath told me in the. 6. Chapiter, where I haue told him mine answere.

likewise to the Angell Apoc. 8. Which made a perfume with the prayers of Saintes, and to the 24. Seniors which had sweete odours, that is, prayers in bowles, &amp;c. But there is no such neede, the Angell Apoc. 8. representeth Christe, the onely high priest that hath authoritie to stande at the altar in heauen, and offer incense, and to present the prayers of the Churche, that they may be acceptable to God. Heb. 13. The Elders are the Churche of God, in the whole world, whose prayers and supplications, only our sauiour Christ maketh acceptable. But it maketh nothing against our Mediatour to God, saith Bristowe, though we are and haue neuer so many Mediatours, so yt all make suite to God by him. Then it maketh no matter howe many petie Gods we haue, so one be principal, as Plato taught. Againe he saith: it is nothing against God alone, to be worshipped, so that we worshippe none but for him. If this were true, it were lawfull to worship the Diuel, because hee is Gods minister, and hath great power vnder him: yea our Sauiour Christ had not aunswered his temptation, when he required to be worshipped, as one that had all the glorie of the world committed by God to him to bestowe at his pleasure, in saying it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him only shalt thou serue. Last of all, he saith it is nothing against God aboue, to know our harts, so yt all others knowe them by him. But Salomon reasoneth that God onely is to be called vpon, because he onely knoweth the heartes of all men. And where findeth Bristowe, that all others, or any one by God, knoweth the heartes of all men? To conclude, the worde onely, excludeth no more with Bristowe, then he list to admitte by his blinde distinctions, which if they may be permitted against the plaine sense and wordes of the Scriptures, nothing shalbe left proper to God, nothing proper to our Sauiour Christe, nothing proper to any thing, that the Scripture maketh peculiar vnto it.
                  The next title is fasting, about which Bristowe reporteth, that I say: Purg. 391. You are they that attend to spirites of errors, &amp; doctrine of deuils, forbidding to

marry, &amp; abstaining, or commaunding to abstaine from meates, which God hath created to bee receiued with thanksgiuing. 1. Tim. 4. There is the brandmarke of Romish religion, that all the water in Tiberis, nor in the Ocean sea, shall not be able to wash out. Against this: Soft alitle (sayeth Bristowe) and you shall see mee drawe inough &amp; inough againe, euen out of your owne puddle, to wash all sufficiently. But what draweth hee? I confesse that Aerius &amp; Iouinian condemned fasting or fasting dayes? what then? Abstinence from certeine meates is a question distinct from fasting, which is abstinence from all meates. But Iouinian (sayeth hee) taught abstinence from certeine meates to profite nothing. Well: Aerius contrariwise taught abstinence from fleshe to be a religious matter, as you Papistes doe. For to absteine from wine, fleshe, fishe, spices, fruites, or any thing which perteyneth to sobrietie, is not to thinke it vnlawfull to eate or drinke any of these, at this tyme, or that time, as it is thought of you Papistes, and a matter of more holynesse, to fill your belly with fishe, then with fleshe, although the fish, wyne, fruites, spices, and such like confections as you eate, be tenne times more dangerous vnto sobrietie and chastitie, then a piece of beef
                        •
                      or bacon, which a poore man eateth on a fryday to satisfie his hunger, and giueth God thankes for it. Your publike admitting of all incentiue meates &amp; drinkes, except flesh or white meate on your fasting dayes, sufficiently declareth, that neither fasting nor chastisement of mens bodyes is your intent: but as the Apostle sayeth, false speaking in hypocrisie. But whome and what doeth Saint Paul meane (sayeth Bristowe?) Hee aunswereth, the Manichees, the Tacianistes, and other heretikes, which sayde, that certeine meates were the creatures of the diuell. Nay Bristowe, not them onely, nor principally; but all other heretikes that sayde, fleshe was vncleane, although they confessed it to be the creature of God, as the Aeriaus and Priscillianistes, and specially the Papistes,

which vnder pretence of holynesse, as fasting and chastitie, commaunde to abstaine from meates and marriage. For they that abstaine from these things, saying they are the creatures of the diuell, speake not a lye in hypocrisie, but an open blasphemie. As for the example of them, whose voluntarie abstinence from meates or marriage, Saint Augustine defendeth, contra Faust. lib. 30. Cap. 6. cannot excuse you, which forbid meates and marriage, more imperiously to some men at all times, and to all men at some times, then euer the Manichees did to their cleargie, or priests, which they called perfect ones.
                  Another saying of myne, Art. 46. Bristowe repeateth: If Iouinian taught that fasting, abstinence from certeine meates, and other bodily exercises, of them selues profite little, his doctrine agreeth with the doctrine of Saint Paul, 1. Timothie. 4. But if he taught, as hee is charged, that such thinges profite nothing at all, wee agree not with him in that opinion.
                  To this (Bristowe sayeth) I woulde fayne wype myne handes of Iouinians heresie, but it will not bee: For his heresie was, that fasting and abstinence is not more meritorious then eating with thankesgiuing. If you call this heresie, I am nothing ashamed of it: there is no more merite in the one than in the other. But howe prooue you that was his heresie? Forsooth Augustine De dogm. Eccles. Cap. 68. so sayeth. But who shall graunt vnto him, that bastarde collection to be of Saint Augustines penning? Well then the vndoubted Augustine, ad Quodvult enim sayeth: meritis adaequabat, hee made equall to the merites, of chaste and faithfull matrimonies, the virginitie, &amp;c.
                  But hee that is acquainted with Saint Augustines writinges, shall perceiue that by merites, often times he meaneth not as the Papistes doe, the desert of good works, but ye dignitie, excellency, commendation.

For merites in that signification as the Papistes vse, he alwayes condemneth them in the Pelagians, and all other, saying that God crowneth or rewardeth in vs his giftes, not our merites. For our merites are nothing but sinnes in Psal. 70. Con. 2. in Psa. 101. in Psa. 144.
                  Now haue we to see, what Saint Paul calleth bodily exercise. Bristowe sayth: walking, ryding, hunting, hawking, and such like exercises, vsed for preseruation of mens bodies. And thinke you Timothie, which to chastice his bodie, vsed to absteine from wine, was doubted of S. Paul, lest he should giue him selfe ouermuch to walking, riding, hawking, hunting? At least wise, heare what S. Ambrose writeth vppon the text, 
                        Exercitium autē corporale, &amp;c. He saith, that bodily exercise is profitable to litle. For to fast and abstaine from meates, the authoritie of the creator remaining, doth not profit much, except godlinesse be added vnto these things, &amp;c. Let Bristowe s
                        •
                     ye, that S Ambrose knewe not white from black, as he saith of mee, and looke better to his conference, of S. Paules abstinence, 1. Cor. 9. from all things ye were offensiue. But where he concludeth, the measure of all abstinence is to tame the bodie, and bring it in subiection to the spirite, but with such moderation, that it fainte not in our necessarie worke, I agree with him, that so it ought to be, but that so it is not, nor yet entended in the popish commaundment of abstinence, as I haue shewed before sufficiently: As for the fasting of yt children of the bridegrome, like to the fastes prescribed by the disciples of Saint Iohn, and of the Pharisees, it is impertinent to speake of, where ye question is not of Christian fasting, but of apostaticall abstinence from meates and marriage: although Christian fasting, is nothing like to the Pharisaicall fasting, but onely in refraining from meate, in the ende and manner altogether differing and vnlike. Math. 6. Luke. 18.

                        •
                     eleeue that there are but two sacraments of the newe 
                        •
                     estament, baptisme, and the Lordes supper, instituted by Christe. 1. Cor. 10. Bristowe asketh, if these be sacraments of the newe testament instituted by Christ, which Saint Paul speaketh of baptisme in the clowd and s
                        ••
                     , and of the spirituall meate and drinke in Manna and the rocke. Because he doeth onely aske, it shall suffice to aunswere onely, yea, they are sacraments of the newe testament, and instituted by Christe, the mediatour of the newe testament, by which our fathers were saued, although by Christe comming in the fleshe, they were 
                        •
                     nstituted differing somewhat in externall fourme and matter, though in inwarde grace and signification they were all one.

                     amed, ergo onely two are instituted. I aunswere, the argument is not of the onely naming of two, but of the whole argument of the Apostle, which is, to proue, that 
                        •
                     he fathers in participation of the sacramentes, were equall with vs, which were not sufficiently proued, if hauing named onely two, there were other fiue, wherein wee are superior to them: So that the naming of two, is in this place the excluding of all other except those two. Nowe let vs discusse Bristowes reasons for the number of Sacraments to be seuen. Wee read of the other fiue in other places. Where I pray you? Of Confirmation, Iohn the 7. You reade more then I can finde there named or signified, except you meane of the increase of Gods spirite in more excellent and euident graces, which the faithfull shoulde receiue after the resurrection and ascension of Christe, which differeth farre from confirmation of children by imposition of handes.
                  Of Penance, you read Iohn. 20. Of power giuen to the Apostles to remit and reteine sinnes: I reade but of

auricular confession and satisfaction, I reade not.
                  Of extreme vnction, you reade Iac. 5: of annoynting the sicke with oyle, which by a speciall gift recouered health of body, as well as remission of sinnes, at the prayer of the faithfull, I reade: but of anealing men desperatly sicke, which hath no hope of bodily recouerie, I reade not.
                  Of orders, you reade, Math. 26. but I reade nothing at all, although I reade that the Apostles were commaunded to continue the celebration of his supper instituted by him, which were before ministers of his sacramentes and preachers of his worde; but of Bennet and Collet, coniurer, subdeacon, or masse priest, I reade not in all the Scripture, nor of Deacon in that Chapter.
                  Of Matrimonie, both yet and I reade Math. 19 but not instituted at that time by Christ, but long before in Paradise, and is no more a sacrament of the newe testament, then the raynebowe, which yet with the couenant thereof remaineth in vse among Christians. But you confesse you reade not in those places, that they are sacramentes, no more doe you reade, 1. Cor. 10. that baptisme, or the Lordes supper are sacraments or any where else. This is a stale quarrell, of the name of sacramentes, which is not founde in Scripture, although the thing signified by the name, that is ye seales of Gods promises, and the name of signe of Gods couenants be often founde.
                  But your laste refuge is, that the Apostle speaketh onely of the firste entrance into Christianitie, which in antiquitie was by baptisme, confirmation, the complement of baptisme, and the Euchariste, and therefore speaketh not of the rest. Beside that this fantasie is manifestly contrarie to the Apostles purpose, which was to shewe, that the externall sacramentes of Gods grace, without a godly life, woulde not serue to assure vs, that God was pleased withvs: it is cleare, that the Corinthians, among whome Saint Paul so long

had preached, coulde not bee without all other sacraments, if any other were. They had children to bee confirmed, they themselues were married, elders were to bee ordered, offenders by penaunce were to bee reconciled, manie were sicke, and some were fallen a sleepe, to bee anealed. And Saincte Paule saith expressely, they were behinde in no grace or gifte of Gods spirite. 1. Corinth. 1. Wherefore, that they were younge nouices newely entred the barres, and not knightes exercised in battell, it is a dreame of Bristowes drowsi

                     . Corin. 10. Againe, howe should the sacrament giue grace of the worke wrought, if faith were requisite in them that receiue them? This argument, saith Bristowe, holdeth aswell against the working of Christs passion. Why sir, the passiō of Christ giueth not grace, but to the faithfull and electe of God.
                  But faith, you say, is no work, nor instrumēt, but only a dispofition as drynesse in wodde, that the fire worketh vppon. I will not enter into any philosophicall disputation with you, whether it bee drinesse or moysture in the wodde that the fire worketh vpon, perhaps you thinke, that water is moyster then ayre, which error, if you had no more, cannot make you an heretike.
                  But I meruaile, what cause you will make faith, seing you exclude it from efficients, except you make it a matter, for the sacraments to worke vpon, or else I know not what you meane by yt your disposition lyke drienesse in woode, which in deede is the thinne ayer, more apte to receiue inflammations, then the thicke water, but perhaps you make it onely a potentia, like materia prima, for you adde, that by our indisposition wee doe not put obicem.
                  
                  
                     
But you hold that the sacraments giue grace of the work wrought, without the good motion of the vser, onely so hee doe no part obicem, that is, so he doe not withstand the working, as if a man be baptised sleeping, and thinking nothing of it. Neuerthelesse seing the scripture often affirmeth that God worketh in vs by faith, faith must needes bee an instrumentall efficient, when you haue saide all that you can, except you will teach vs newe gramer and Lògike. You confesse the scripture sayth, that by beleeuing and other good actions, wee worke our owne saluation, Phil. 2. as by way of meriting, but it saith not that we worke the effect of any sacrament: neither doe I say, that wee worke the effecte of any sacrament, but that God worketh in vs according to faith, which he giueth vs, and his election. You say further; that the scripture teacheth, that the passion of Christ giueth to our deedes vertue to merite: where is that scripture written? for vntill you shewe me where it is written, I will say still to you as I saide to Allen, ye Church of Christ abhorreth that blasphemie, beleeuing stedfastly, that we are iustified freely by his grace through the redemptiō of Christ Iesus, without respect of our works. Rom. 3. 4.
                  But yet Bristowe will make men beleeue, that I shew manifolde ignorance, where I say Purg. 35. The meane on Gods behalfe by which we are made partakers of the fruites of Christes passion, and so graffed into his bodie, is his holy spirite of promise, which is the earnest and assuring of our inheritaunce: who worketh in vs faith, as the onely meane by which the righteousnesse of Christ is applyed vnto vs, Ephe. 1. And as for the sacramentes, (which you seeme to make the only conduites of Gods mercie) we are taught in the holy scriptures that they are the seales of Gods promises giuen for the confirmation of our faith, as was circumcision to Abraham, when he was iustified before through faith. Rom. 4.
                  Bristowes eyes being daseled at the cleere light of this trueth, turneth his heade away from the matter, and wrangleth against diuerse points of Caluinisme, as hee

saith, but in deede of meere Bristowisme. For Caluin neuer helde any such matter as he imagineth: He asketh whether this be to say, that all men are iustified before they come to the sacrament, as though Caluin said they were. Whereas a great number are iustified neither before, nor after the receipt of them. But this is to say, that as Abraham was iustified by faith, without respect of the sacrament, so are all they that are iustified, iustified by faith, without respect of the sacrament. Secondly he asketh, whether all sacraments be seales of such a matter. Yea verely, or else saint Paul proueth the iustification of the Gentiles by faith, very feebly, after the example of Abraham. Thirdly hee asketh whether all Iewes were iustified, before they came to circumcision, which I neuer hearde any man to affirme, but that as many Iewes as were iustified, were iustified by faith, as Abraham was, circumcision no more regarded in their iustification, then it was in the iustification of Abraham. Last of all he asketh, whether circumcision were to the Iewes a seale of such a matter? still he calleth it such a matter, because he dare not name iustification by faith. O the stinge of a wicked conscience. But to the question. I aunswere that to ye Iewes which were iustified by faith, circumcision was a seale of the righteousnesse of faith, which is imputed to them, as it was to Abraham without merite, or respect of their circumcision.
                  Other pointes of mine ignorance, he saith, are about the holy spirite of promise, whereof Saint Paul speaketh Ephe. 1. which I say is the meane, to make vs partakers of the fruites of Christes passion: Item the meane to graffe vs into his bodie: Item, that it worketh in vs faith. In the conclusion, he noteth the ignorance of the Protestantes, where they holde, this spirite promised to be nothing else, but the gifte of tongues, that is to say, Christs greatest gifte, to be his least gifte. Out vpon the shamelesse lyer, which of the Protestantes canst thou name, that so holdeth? We all holde that the holy spirite of promise, Ephes. 1. is the spirite of adoption, by which we are assured of eternall life. Rom. 8. And as for the spirite, prophecyed

by Ioel, and Iohn Baptist, promised by Christ to be sent after his ascension, we holde not to be specially of the spirit of adoption, which the Apostles &amp; al ye faithfull had before Christes death, and much lesse of that spirit, which your Bishops giue by imposition of hands, in their counterfeit confirmation, which is the spirit of vanitie, whose fruites appeare not in any of the receiuers: But we holde that promised gifte of Gods spirit, to be that wonderful reuelation of knowledge and vnderstanding &amp; vtterāce in all states &amp; degrees of true Christians generally, beside a great number of particular giftes, not perpetuall, bestowed vpon the Church in diuerse speciall members, for the certifying thereof in the first publishing of the gospel. As for your conference of scriptures, whereof you prate so much, is a meere confusion of matters of diuerse senses. According to which manner of conference, not weighing the sense of euery place, by the proper circumstances thereof, but following onely a sounde and similitude of some wordes, euerie heretike might colour his heresie, were it neuer so absurde, as the Valentinians of whom Irenaeus testifieth, that they patched diuerse sentences together, to make a shewe, as though their heresie were contained in holy write: which was nothing else, but as if a man breaking a goodly image of a king in peeces, shoulde of the peece after his owne manner ioyned together, make the image of a dogge, or a foxe or other foule beaste, Iren. lib. 1. Chapt. 1. such is your conference of the spirite of promise, wherewith the faithfull are sealed Ephes. 1. with the spirite of tongues and prophecie which came vppon the twelue, on whom saint Paul layed his hands. Acts 19. The last errour of faith hee chargeth mee, to bee the onely meane, which hee saith, is no meane but a disposition, hee thinketh it sufficiently discouered before, wherevnto I also thinke that I haue made answere sufficiently.

                        About the sacramentes in speciall. The necessitie and effecte of baptisme. Bristowe.
                        
                     
                  
                  Concerning baptisme, I say it is necessary for al christians Fulke.
                     
to receiue, that are not by necessity excluded from it. 1. Pet. 3. Bristow saith, it is necessarie for all men, but when it cannot be actually had, the effectuall desire of it supplyeth the want: which desire infantes haue not, and therfore onely the actuall hauing of baptisme, doth quicken them in Christ, being dead in Adam. Touching the saluation of infants of the faithful dying without baptisme, I said nothing but by implication, that there is no such necessitie of Baptisme, that the want of the outwarde sacrament shoulde condemne the seede of the faithful, perteining to gods election &amp; couenant, where there is no default, either of contempt or neglect of it. Ro. 9. Ge. 17. And seeing Bristow alloweth ye effectuall desire in men of yeares to supply the want, which yet ye wordes of his text, Iam. 3. of which he taketh colour and authoritie of his doctors, that condemne all vnbaptised infants wil not beare, what reason is it, why he should not extende his supply, vnto the effectuall desire of those infants, parents, and friends, whose faith he acknoledgeth to supplie the want of actuall faith in the infants that are baptised? Beside this hee saith that he did mark wel ynough where I said yt the sacramēts giue grace according to ye election of God. As though all infants baptised, &amp; so dying be not of Gods electe, or that some be not saued, although they be baptised, &amp; asketh what scripture I haue for this geere? But in deede he bow leth at the wrong marke, for in saying yt the sacramentes tooke effect according to ye faith of ye receiuer and according to gods election, I ment, yt God in baptisme giueth grace to infāts, which haue no actual faith of their owne, according to his eternal electiō in mercy. But whether al infants baptised &amp; so dying be of ye nūber of gods elect, as I do not know, so I wil not contend. But this I know, that if they were not elected of God before the foundations of the world were laide, the receiuing of baptisme, cannot make them Gods elect. Ephe. 1. Where Bristowe vrgeth the saying of saint Peter, 1. Pet. 3. baptisme saueth vs now, it is a weake argument to proue the baptisme of infants, either to saue them all that receiue it, or to condemne all that receiueth it not. For explicating him

selfe of what baptisme hee speaketh, he addeth, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, as you woulde say, outwarde washing, which is the externall sacrament, but the interrogation of a good conscience towardes God, which is the thing signified by outwarde washing, and yet not founde in infantes, but in them that haue knowledge, among whom, whosoeuer hath it not, hee shall no more bee saued then any was preserued from drowning that was not in the Arke of Noah. In which Arke one at leaste was saued from bodily drowning, which was not inwardly baptised with the spirite vnto saluation. The figure of whom, I might vrge as probable as Bristow doth of the whole number saued, from drowning, like vnto whom al they that are baptised are brought into the visible Church, although some with Cham, are not members of the mysticall bodie of Christ.

                        Real presence transubstantiation.
                     
                  
                  Touching the Eucharist I saide, Christ is present at Bristowe. his supper, but not after a grosse and Capernaicall maner Fulke. but as he was presēt in Manna to the fathers. 1. Cor. 10. Bristowes aunswere is, it was a spirituall meate, a spirituall drinke, for it signified Christ. But Saint Paule saith expresly it was Christ, and the Rocke was Christe. But, est, is, taken for significat, where it pleaseth the Papists, where it pleaseth them not, it is blasphemie, impudencie, falsification &amp;c. Further he saith, they all did eate one, and the same meate, but not that they and we eate one, &amp; the same meate. Although Saint Augustine is cleare, they did eate one, and the same that we eate, yet I will proue it by argument out of the Scripture, that which we eate and that which they did eate was, &amp; is Christ, ergo they and we eat one and the same meate, euen as they were baptised with the same baptisme: for the church of God neuer had but one baptisme. As for the Capernaites, he saith, I vnderstande not the chapter, Iohn 6. and so onely telleth his fantasie vppon it. But

what mine vnderstanding is of that chapter, &amp; also mine answere to al popish reasons, falsely gathered thereout: let it appeare in my confutation of Heskins &amp; Sanders.
                  Concerning transubstantiation, I said, Of all follyes this is the greatest, that when the Papistes haue prated neuer so long of the sacrifice of breade and wine, at the laste they wil haue no breade nor wine in their sacrifice. First he saith, this wise argument, proueth the papistes &amp; their fathers the old writers, to be fooles. To this I replye, those old writers, which are none of the papistes fathers, although they supposed Melchizedechs bread and wine, to bee a figure of our sacrament, yet they were not such fooles to denye breade and wine to remaine in our sacrament. But for answere, Bristow saith, that I my selfe confesse, yt the drink of the water of the rock, was a figure of our drink in Christs Chalice, although that were water, &amp; this is no water, no nor made of water, how much more, might Melchizedechs bread and wine be a figure of it, although there bee no breade nor wine in it, considering it was made of breade and wine, and retaineth the formes of breade and wine? &amp;c. But where hath he this confession of mine? I neuer saide the water of the Rocke was a figure of Christes cuppe, but euen Christs cuppe it selfe, and the very bloud of Christ in a sacrament, to the faithfull, as the wine in the cuppe is to vs. For Christ did euen then feede his true members with his flesh &amp; bloud vnto eternall life. Iohn. 6.

                        Marriage of Votaries: as Bishops, Priests, Deacons.
                     
                  
                  Because we say, the marriage of votaries is sinne and Bristowe. no marriage. Fulke saith, we are the forbidders of marriage, 
                     Fulke. 
                     that saint Paul speaketh off. 1. Tim. 4. But this saith Bristow, I haue shewed to pertaine to the Eucratites, &amp; Maniches &amp;c. and I haue shewed that it pertaineth more properly to the Papistes. But saint Augustine aunswereth them &amp; Fulke at once, saith Bristowe, 
                        
                           Cont. Faust. lib. 30. Cap. 6. Ille prohibet nubere, qui hoc malum esse dicit:  Hee forbiddeth to marrie, yt saith it is a naughtie thing, non qui huic bono aliud

melius, anteponit, and not he, which to this good thing, preferreth an other better thing. Well, if he forbidde to marrie and to teache the doctrine of Deuills, which saith marriage is a naughty thing, then you Papists, which (as you confessed before) saie that the mariage of votarics is sinne, saie it is a naughty thing, and consequently forbidding to marry doe teache the doctrine of Deuills: neither can you shift a waie to saie, you doe not affirme, that which is marriage indeede, to be a sinne but that which is falsely called marriage: for you saie euen as the Manichees in this point, it is a naughty thing, for the Clergie, and them that be in holy orders to marry, and therefore you compell them to the vowe, and forbidde mariage to all that will enter into those orders, and also into moonkery, which you call religion, as though holynes and religion could not stande with marriage. And therefore to you, as well as to the Manichees Saint Augustine speaketh in the. 4. Chapter of that Booke, in defense of the catholique Church which in his time forbadde not marriage, nor compelled any to virginity. 
                        Hoc nobis primum responde
                              •
                           
                           tis velim, &amp;c. I would you should answere this thing first vnto vs, whither it be the doctrine of Deuills to make any virgins at all, or only to make them by prohibition of marrying? if by prohibition, it perteyneth nothing to vs, for we our selues doe iudge it as foolishe a thinge to staie one that is willinge (to be a virgine) as it is a wicked &amp; verie vngodly thing to compel one that is vnwilling. As for the preferring of virginity, in them that haue the gift, and for whom it is conuenient, for setting forth of the kingdome of God, before marriage, according to the doctrine of Saint Paule, wee agree with Saint Augustine and dissent from Iouinian, if his doctrine were as it is reported. But if Iouinian taught (as I saide) Ar. 45. that such as coulde not conteyne, though they had vowed virginity, should neuerthelesse be married, this was the doctrine of Saint Paul, it is better to marry then to burne. And although Ambrose &amp; Augustine, account such marriage to be adultery, or

worse then adultery, yet the holy Ghost saith: marriage is honorable in all men and the bedde vndefiled. Heb. 13. And for them that cannot conteine, although they haue vowed virginity, it is better to marry then to burne, 1. Cor. 7. except Bristowe thinke it better to quenche the fier of lust, with fornication and vncleanes: For all men cannot conteine, neither can all men make them selues chaste for the kingdome of God. Math 19, But this conference of Scripture pleaseth not Bristowe, for he counteth it none at all, comparing mee for want of conference of scripture to a cloude without water: well then, let vs heare what sweete dewe commeth from Bristowes cloude.
                  First hee asketh what it is to burne. Hee aunswereth, to bee troubled with the pricking of the fleshe, say the heretikes. Not so, say wee: for Sainct Paul himselfe was troubled much, with such pricking, 2. Corin. 12. and yet hee was not bidden to marrie, when hee prayed so instantly against it, but it was saide vnto him by Christ, My grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is perfected in infirmitie, &amp;c. First he belyeth vs, whome hee calleth heretikes, to say that to burne, is nothing else but to bee troubled with the pricking of the flesh: for wee holde, there is no praise of virginitie, where there is no naturall prouocation vnto luste. But to burne wee say, is to bee so troubled, as men are, that are inflamed with lust, and haue no lawfull meanes to quench the same.
                  Secondly, beholde howe shamefully hee slaundereth Saint Paul, to be much troubled with such pricking of the flesh, where he complayneth of the generall rebellion of the fleshe, against the spirite, the messenger of Satan to buffet him, euen that lawe of his members, of which hee complayneth Rom. 7. which brought him captiue vnder the lawe of sinne. As for that pricking, which Bristowe speaketh of to bee so much in a bodie so exercised with afflictions and trauels, with hunger, and fastings, and in a man of such age, as Sainct

Paul was at that time, when he wrote vnto the Corinthians the second Epistle, it is altogether incredible. And confessing a generall rebellion of the fleshe, against the spirite vnto all sinne, it is not probable that he should in this place, complaine of that one kinde onely, from which age and weakenesse of bodie woulde priuiledge him, if godly exercise did not ridde him. What is it then to burne, saith Bristowe, or to be burned? saint Paul himselfe telleth vs, it is, not to containe: If they doe not conteine, let them marrie, for it is better to marrie then to burne, for marriage is honorable and vndefiled, but fornicatours and adulterers God will iudge. The conference whereof is this: Let married folke vse their owne bedde, &amp;c. and let the vnmarried folke enter into marriage, rather then not to containe, to burne, to commit fornication. So that to burne, not to containe, and to commit fornication, by Bristowes conference, is all one: So that hee which committeth not fornication, although hee bee continually inflamed with filthie luste, yet by Bristowes iudgement, hee burneth not, he is continent, hee is a virgine. Againe, if not to containe, and to burne be nothing else, but to commit fornication, it woulde followe in saint Paules wordes, that men are not commaunded to marrie, before they haue made triall of their incontinence by committing fornication, which seeing it is horrible absurditie: it followeth, that the Apostle to preuent fornication, exhorting men to marrie which containe not, seeing it is better to marrie then to burne, vnderstandeth incontinence and burning, for an inflāmation of lust, without fornication, or actuall filthinesse committed.
                  But whatsoeuer saint Paul speaketh of marriage of them that doe not containe, hee meaneth it of such as haue made no vowe to liue vnmarried. For of those that haue vowed, his sentence is (saith Bristowe) that they incurre damnation if they marrie, because they haue broken their first faith: 1. Tim. which faith with S. Augustine hee vnderstandeth for their last vowe of widowhood, notwithstāding, that I shewed, both by conference in the same chapter, by the title of, first, and by

the name of faith, that it cannot properly bee so taken, but for the faith of Christianitie, euen as he saith: if any prouide not for his family, he hath denied the faith. Where I finde the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in the scripture is neuer vsed for a vowe or promise made to God. Bristowe aunswereth, why? doe not you say your selfe, that both there &amp; once afore in ye same chapt. it is vsed for ye vow or promise made in baptisme? no sir. I neuer said it. I said that the first faith may aptly be taken for the faith of baptisme, and Christianitie, except you wil say that the faith of Christianitie embraced by baptisme, is nothing else but a vowe or promise made to God. Againe, can you remember neuer a place (saith he) where the faith of god is the promise of God? looke Rom. 3. yea sir, I remember 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      taken for the trueth of Gods promise, but I finde not yet 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      taken for the vowe or promise made to God, which because you your selfe, so great and daily a conferrer of scriptures, coulde not finde, you cur
                     
                        •
                     olled my saying, repeating my wordes for a vowe or promise, and leauing out that I added, made to God. The Latine phrase of the faith or promise of marriage vsed by Saint Augustine and other Latine writers, aunswereth not to my demaunde, of the vse of the greeke worde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                      in the scriptures: which if the Apostle had taken for the promise of widowhood made in their admission, it is more like he woulde haue called it

                     , their former faith, and not 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      their first faith. Againe the conference whiche Bristowe vrgeth, of them that are alreadie turned back after Satan, most aptely agreeth to thē that had forsaken not onely their widowhood, but also their Christianitie, Loe, saith Bristowe, your selfe are compelled to graunt, that which you denyed, to wit that they shall be damned because they forsake widowhoode? and how forsake they widowhoode but by marrying? ergo, Saint Paul saith they shall be damned for marrying: so inuincible is the texte, in our exposition. Fulke, it goeth harde with you. And all this, because I saide such wanton young huswiues, proceede so farre, that at length they forsake widowhood, Christianitie and al. Saide I onely because they forsake widowhoode?

No, but because they waxe wanton against Christ, because they haue forsaken the first faith, which is Christianity, and not only because they haue married, and giuen ouer theyr widowhoode: whereof whether there were a vowe or no, it is not proued. Although it be probable, there was a promise made vnto the Church, because such poore widowes susteined of the Churches almes, were imployed to be helpers 1. Cor. 12. in the office of Deacons. Rom. 16. Considering that it was not sufficient for the sicke and impotent, that men should be collectors and distributers of the almes, but womē also were necessary, for diuers seruices about them which were not conuenient for men to exercise. But if I should graunt vnto you, that the first faith here, signifieth the last vowe of widowhoode, yet it foloweth not of this place, that all that haue married after rashe vowes made to the contrary, are damned. For Saint Paule speaketh not of them that were constreined by the necessity of incontinencie (which it is not euery mans gift to auoyde) to flye to the generall remedy appoynted by God, for auoyding of fornication, that euery man should haue his wife, and euery woman should haue her husband, without any exception: but only of them he speaketh, yt waxed wanton against Christ, which being liuing to the worlde, were dead to God. What is this against them, which ignorantly rashly or constrainedly made a vowe to performe, that which they were not able? namely continence or chastity, without mariage, the breache whereof is not only by mariage, but much more by fornication and vncleanes, yea by continuall burning, without actuall filthinesse, which with Saint Paule is incontinence.
                  And yet the Papistes, as though there were no way to breake such vowe, but by marriage, which is the best meane of chastitie, for them that can not be chaste in single life, crie out damnatiō only against married votaries, affirming that infinite whoredoms and vncleanes, are lesse breach of vow, then marriage, and the marriage

of votaries to be no marriage. Yet Saint Ambrose, who counteth it an adulterie against Christe, for a vowed virgine to marrie, counteth the marriage of such a one, in respect of her bodily husbande to be lawfull matrimony, and a much lesse fault, to enter into mariage, then once to committe fornication. Ad Virg. Laps. Cap. 5. And more plainly Saint Augustine which counteth the mariages of such, of whom the Apostle speaketh to be worse then adulteries, in respect of the breache of theyr vowe, made to Christ: yet counteth them to be mariages, and no adulteries, and detesteth the separation of such married persons, De bono Vid

                  Where Allen railing against our Bishops, and as he termeth our disordered newe ministery, saith, that ere euer they be well warmed in theyr benisices, they must for the most part, as it were Annexum ordini, haue a wife. I answered, Belyke Saint Paule taketh marriage to be so annexed to the order of an ecclesiasticall minister, yt he neuer describeth the perfect paterne of a Bishop or Deacon, but one of the first pointes is, that he be the husband of one wife. Bristowe saith, I alledge the text to salue our Bishops itching lust: and more blasphemously speaketh Allen against our ministers marriage, whom yet they account to be but laie men. Where are they nowe that saye mariage is a naughty thing? But concerning the terme of Annexum ordini, although I saide in derision therof, Belyke, &amp;c. as before, yet I ment not, that it was necessary for euery perfect minister to be married, but that none is more perfect, then they that are married. Notwithstanding some men considering that the Apostle requireth hospitality, that is the charitable entertainment of poore straungers, as a speciall vertue in a Bishoppe or minister of the Church, thinke marriage to bee more conuenient then sole life, for that degree, because diuerse partes of hospitality, of whiche Saint Paule maketh, the washinge of the Saintes feete, one, and suche like, are not conuenient but for women to exercise, whome it were

inconuenient, that a Bishop should kepe in his house, and not be a maried man. But Bristowe will teache me to vnderstand, what Saint Paule meaneth by the husband of one wife, by conference of that place. 1. Tim. 5. where he will haue a widowe to be chosen, such a one, quae fuit vnius viri vx
                           •
                        r, as hath bene the wife of one husband: so that he requireth in a Bishop, Priest, or Deacon, to be made, that he haue had only one wife. Indeede Bristowe: I learne by this conference, that Saint Paule who knewe how to write his minde in Greeke, although he had not spoken expresly of the behauiour of Bishops, and Deacons wiues. 1. Tim. 3. yet vsing the present temps, in speaking of Bishops, Elders, and Deacons, to be the husbande of one wife, &amp; the preterperfect temps, in speaking of widowes, which haue had one husband did meane, that he requireth such a one to be made Bishop, Elder or Deacon, which presently hath a wife: and not which had a wife, that at the time of their election were deade, as the widowes husbande. It behoueth a Bishop 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      to be vnreprouable, the husband of one wife, sober, &amp;c. except you will likewise say, a Bishop must be such a one, as hath bene sober, &amp;c. although he be not so nowe. Againe, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      let Deacons be the husbandes of one wife. And againe Tit. 1.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , if any man is vnreprehensible, the husbande of one wife. Therefore a Bishoppe, Elder, or Deacon, may be he, that hath a wife, presently, and not he that hath had one which is dead, onely. Moreouer I learne by conference of that place, 1. Tim. 5. that Polygamie, which is many wiues at one time, is forbidden a Bishop, and not second mariage, as it hathben commonly and of olde time taken of many: seeing there is no reason to exclude a poore widow from almes and office in the Church, that hath liued continently with more husbands then one, so that she haue kept her to one at one time: But it is not meete, that she should be elected to an office in the Church, which hath bene an adulteresse, or vnlawfully diuorced from her husband,

hath maried an other, although she may be releeued by almes, if she be penitent.
                  But Bristowe would haue men to marke it well, that yet neuer from the Apostles time, to this day, any one Bishoppe or Prieste, that is confessed to haue beene a good one, did marrie afterwardes, no not Iouinian him selfe. Hee would faine if he durst, say that no Bishoppe or Priest had a wife: but that were easily refelled out of Eusebius and all auncient histories. Clemens Alex. Strom. lib. 3. sheweth that the Apostles Peter and Philip, had wiues and did beget children. Also he saith of Saint Paule, 
                        Vnius quoque vxoris virum utique admittit, seu hoc Presbyter, seu Diaconus, seu Laicus viens matrimonio citra reprehensionem. He alloweth the husband of one wife, whether he be Elder, or Deacon, or lay man, vsing matrimony without reprehension. Seeing therefore he putteth no difference in respect of matrimony, betweene a Laye man, and a Cleargie man, it is plaine, that it was as lawfull for Elders and Deacons to marrie in his time, as for Lay men. Againe the same Clemens saith against them that denyed the lawfulnesse of generation, after he had cited diuerse textes of Scripture. 
                        Quid autem ad haec dicunt, qui in legem, &amp;c. But what say they to these thinges, which inueygh against the lawe, and against matrimony, as that it was graunted onely in the law, &amp; not also in the new Testament? What can they say to these lawes that are made, which abhorre sowing and generation, when he maketh a Bishop also, him that ruleth his house wel, guide of the Church? And the marriage of one woman buildeth the house of our Lorde. Therefore he saith, that all thinges are cleane to the cleane. Seeing therefore that marriage is as free by his iudgement by the new Testament, as by the lawe, and Aarons Priestes, were at libertie to marrie, no man neede to doubt, but the Bishops and Elders of the Churche of Christe, are at as great libertie, and vsing their libertie in his time, were allowed for good ones.
                  
                     
Long after his time, the councell of Gangra in their Epistle to the Bishops of Armenia complaine of Eustachius and his sect, saying, 
                        Presbyteros verò, qui matrimonis contraxerunt, sperni debere dicunt. They saie that Elders or Priests which haue ioyned them selues in matrimony, ought to be despised. Therefore these catholique Bishops thought those Priests good ones, which did ioyne them selues in matrimony, &amp; so they made their Canon: 
                        Si quis discernit Presbyterum coniugatum, &amp;c. If any man make difference of a married Priest, as though by occasion of his marriage, he ought not to offer, and doth therfore absteine from his oblation, let him be accursed. Cap. 4. Of Deacons also the Ancyrane councell decreeth Cap. 10. 
                        Diaconi quicunque, &amp;c. Whosoeuer be ordeyned Deacons, if at the same time when they were ordeined, they protested, saying that they would be ioyned in marriage, because they could not so continue, if afterwarde they haue married wiues, let them remaine in the ministerie, because the Bishop hath giuen them licence: But so many as haue helde their peace, and taken imposition of handes professing continencie, and afterwarde be ioyned in marriage, ought to ceasse from the ministerie.
                  
                  Finally the Decree of Pope Stephanus is cited Dist, 31. Aliter se by Gratian and Iuo: lib 4. allowing the tradition of the orientall Churches for marriage of theyr Church ministers. 
                        Aliter se Orientalium, &amp;c. The tradition of the Easterne Churches hath it otherwise, and otherwise is the tradition of this holy Church of Rome. For the Priests, Deacons, and Subdeacons of their Churches, are coupled in marriage: but none of the Priestes of this Church, from the Subdeacon vnto the Bishoppe hath licence to enter into mariage. It were hard if there were neuer a good one among all the Cleargie of the East Churches, since the Apostles time, which haue ben married and yet are.
                  To conclude, I trust it is apparant to the indifferent reader, that such texts of Scripture as I alledged in those

two bookes, which Bristow vndertaketh in this confuse manner to confute, were rightly applyed, and without all violence or wresting, doe proue sufficiently that for which they were called to witnesse. And as for the popish conference of Scriptures, wherof Bristowe once againe with great lothsomnesse doeth bragge, how sound it is, you may perceiue by this example, &amp; taste, giuen by him in this Chapter. Wherefore I maruell much what learned ministers of our church these were, whom Bristow affirmeth (being in number more then a dozen, and diuerse of no vulgar wittes) by their onely hearing of your conference of scriptures to haue become papists. By like some vagabonde, irregular, and vnhonest persons, being depriued of their ministerie for their vngodly behauiour, haue sought fauour among them by reuolting, or at least counterfaiting to be reuolted to papistrie, when they be of no religion, commended by Bristow for their wittes, but neither for their honestie nor learning.

                  To defende, that the doctors, as they be confessed to be ours in very many pointes, so they be ours in all pointes, and the Protestants Bristowe. in no point. All the doctors sayings that he alledgeth, are examined and answered.
               
               
                  The first part of his doctors, generally his challenging words.
               
               I confesse not the doctors to be yours in very manye points, nor simply in fewe pointes, nor all in any point Fulke. of controuersie, but graunting that for a fewe errours, which you haue common with them, in which you also farre exceede them, as in prayers for the dead, prayers to saintes, some superstitious or superfluous ceremonies, I affirme that in the greatest and chiefest pointes of controuersie, they are either all with vs, or not one against vs.
               
                  
                  2 A generall answere to his challenge, declaring that 
                        〈◊〉
                      neede not to answere his doctors particularly. 
                  Bristowe.
               
               His first reason is, because I sayde: wee stande for authoritie Fulke. onely to the iudgement of the holy scriptures, which scriptures in the chapter going before, he hath satisfied. But how he hath satisfied them, let the indifferent readers iudge. And seeing the Papistes offer to stād to their iudgement in all things, and wee refuse them not as witnesses vnto the truth, in most things, he is not discharged in reason of answering my doctors.
               His second reason is, for yt I do answere all mine own doctors for him, if it be wel considered: &amp; what is your consideration? In that I confesse them to haue helde with you the very same points, for which wee must bee condemned (no remedie) as differing from the doctors in the greatest pointes. What are those I pray you? Bristowe answereth. For why doeth he saye, that we are against the honor of God, &amp; against the offices of Christ, but because wee holde inuocation of saints, and worshipping of their reliques? yes sir, for other more grosse idolatrie and defacing of the kingdome, priesthod, and propheticall office of Christe, and for holding these two pointes more absurdly and grossely then any of the doctors did. Againe, why doth he say, that we are against the authoritie of Gods worde, but because we hold with traditions, as the doctors did? I aunswere, the doctors held with no traditions that were proued to be against the written worde of God, they made not the decrees of Councels and Popes, of equall autoritie with the worde of God as you do.
               But of one of the greatest pointes he repeateth my wordes, in which I say expressely: I confesse with M. Allen, that the old writers, not only knewe, but also haue expressed the value of our redemption by Christ, in such wordes, as it is not possible that the Popish satisfaction can stande with them. And yet on the other side (saith Bristowe) see what followeth immediatly. Against the value of which redemption, if they haue vttered any

thing, by the worde of satisfaction, or any thing else, we may lawfully reiect their authoritie, not onely though they be doctors of the church, but also if they were angels from heauen. But what I pray you concludeth Bristowe of these two sayings. His wordes followe immediatly: So that nowe we no more neede to defende against him, that wee are not contrarie to the doctors, then that the doctors are not contrary to them selues. As though it were impossible for men to be contrarie to themselues. And yet I say no more of them, then of the angels, that they are contrary to the trueth in this point, but that if they were, wee might reiect them as lawfully as the angels, if they brought another gospell. Last of all he sayth: Wee neede not defend that we are contrarie to our selues in the same. For in what wordes the doctors speake thereof, the same do wee. Neither is the antecedent true, nor if it were, doth the argument followe. For you will not saye as the olde writers doe, that through the redemption of Christ, a man is iustified before God by faith onely. without respect of his workes or merites. And where you vse the doctors wordes, you either vse them in a contrary sense, or else elude them with additions &amp; distinctions, neither grounded on the Scriptures nor on the olde doctors, but inuented out of your owne hereticall braines. After which manner it is easie to defēd that they say nothing against any heresie, which they doe not condemne by name, although they plainly aduouche the trueth, against such errour.
               
                  3 I ioygne with him neuerthelesse particularly. 
                  Bristowe.
               
               Although they ascribe not infallibilitie to a fewe, Fulke. but onely to the vniforme consent of the doctours, yet he is content to ioyne vppon this issue, that the protestants haue not against them for any one article at all, so much as any one doctour at all. Howe he auoydeth mine euidence, you shall see in that which followeth:
               
                  
                  The second parte. Of his doctors particularly: First, whether they expound any scripture against vs. 
                  Bristowe.
               
               As touching antichrist, I sayd, Pur. 249. The seat of antichrist was apointed to be set vp in the Latin church Fulke. according to the reuelation of Saint Iohn, and the exposition of Ireneus, who iudged yt Lateinos was yt number of ye beasts name spokē of Apoc. 13. To this Bristo
                     ••
                   answereth, here are two ragged conclusiōs. The first, antichrist was appointed to be set vp in the Latin church, ergo the Pope of Rome is antichrist. No sir, I made no such argument, but of the authoritie of Irenaeus I proued, that the seat of antichrist was appointed to be set vp in the Latine church, and therfore superstition was somewhat forwarder then in the Greeke church. The other conclusion (sayeth Bristowe) is this: Irenaeus iudged that Lateinos should be the name of antichrist, (as Iesus was and is the name of Christ) ergo, he iudged that antichrist was apointed to be set vp in the Latin church: I answere, the antecedent is yours Master Bristowe, and not mine. For I sayd not, that Irenaeus iudged that Lateinus should be the name of antichrist, as Iesus is the name of Christ, as though antichrist should be a singular man: For Irenaeus sayeth it, in respect of his kingdome, which should be in the Latine part of the world: V
                        •
                     lde verisimile est, quoniam verissimum regnum hoc hab
                        ••
                      vocabulum. It is verie like, because the moste true kingdome hath that name, which was the kingdome of the Romanes. Therefore wee must seeke in the Romane kingdome for antichist: in which kingdome haue reigned hitherto Emperours and Popes. Emperours haue beene heathenish &amp; Christened: the heathenish it could not be, because antichrist must sit in the Church, and they were altogether without. Of the Emperours, some were Catholike, and some hereticall. The Catholike no man will charge: the hereticall Emperors were no false Prophets, as antichrist must be a false teacher, that with lying signes and wonders shall deceiue the world:

wherefore it remaineth that of all that haue hitherto reigned in the Latine Empire, the Pope must bee that principall antichrist. For Caluine and Luther, whome Bristowe fondly nameth to be in the Latine Churche) neuer bare rule in the Latine kingdome. Bristowes last refuge is, that Irenaeus did not so iudge. Hee onely sayeth, it is very like to be so. I aske no more but his iudgement of the likelyhod: For I knowe hee reciteth other names, which haue in them the same number, as Euan, Teitan, and in the ende will pronounce certeinly of none, holding, that it is better to expect the fulfilling of the Prophecy, then to pronounce rashly of any. But seeing antichrist is alreadie reuealed, and all the prophecy of his apostasie and seduction accomplished, wee doubt not to ioyne to that auncient likelyhod of Irenaeus, the later likelyhodes of the same name agreeing in number with Lateinos in Greeke, Romiith in Hebrewe, not neglecting Ecclesia Italica. The consent of all which names, signifying the region, the citie, the kingdom, beare so harde vpon the Pope &amp; the popish church of Rome, that Bristowe, though he laye both his shoulders to it, shall neuer be able to remoue it.
               Secondly I sayde of Hierom, Pur. 373. Hee was not such a slaue to the church of Rome, yt whatsoeuer pleased the bishops of that see, he was readie to accept: For then he would not haue beene so bold to call Rome the purple whore of Babylon, Praef. ad Paul. in lib. Didym. Bristow replyeth: as though when he calleth Rome so, or when Augustine calleth it the Westerne Babylon, they meane the church of Rome. I sayed not they meane the church of Rome, as it was in their time, but that antichrist shoulde sit at Rome, whome the scripture sayeth, must sit in the temple or Church of God, 2. Thes. 2. Neither doeth Augustine meane it of the empire, but of antichrist, which should arise in the Romane empire. Neither doeth Hierom meane of ye Paganisme of Rome, that remained in his time, which in ye place by Brist. cited ad Marcell. Ep. 16. he testifieth to haue ben trovnder

feete, but of the purple whore sitting aloft, vpon the rose coulered beast, of the wine of whose fornication, all nations were made drunken, of the blasphemie written in her forehead, of the seuen hilles &amp;c. although in his tyme, he confesse there was the churche of God, the tryumphe of the Apostles and Martyrs, &amp;c. &amp; gentilitate calcata &amp; Gentilitie being troaden vnder feete, the Christian name dayly lifting it selfe aloft. But that Hierom in doubtes did seeke for resolution of Damasus bishop of Rome, and that all other must likewise doe. Bristowe citeth his Epistle ad Damasum. To
                        〈…〉
                     . 2. in which he consulteth with Damasus, whether hee should vse the name of Hippostasis, and saith further, that whosoeuer gathereth not with Damasus, doth scatter: that is to saye, whoso is not Christes is antichrists, I aunswere, all this was well, so long as Damasus was a Catholike bishop, but that Saint Hierome was not readie to accept whatsoeuer it pleased the bishop of Rome, it is manifest by that he affirmeth Liberius to haue subscribed to the Arrians, in Catal. script. which he would neuer haue done, if he had thought it impossible for the bishop of Rome to erre, or necessarie for him to followe the bishop of Romes doctrine in all things. The place cited ad Damasum with answere to it, is in my confutation of Saunders Rocke, Cap. 15. And therefore the saying of Leo Epist. 89. That Christ tooke Peter into the participation of the vndiuided vnitie, proueth not, that it is all one to be Peters and to be Christes, when Peter erreth from Christe, and much lesse, that it is all one (as Bristowe sayeth) to be in vnitie with Peter and his successours, meaning the Popes, and to be in vnitie with Christ, from whome, not onely all Popes in matter now of controuersie doe. But diuerse of the Bishops &amp; Popes of Rome haue beene deuided into horrible and confessed errours and heresies, of both partes: as Gentilisme, Arrianisme, Eu
                     •
                  ichianisme, Menothelitisme, Sadduceisme.
               Againe, I saide Pur. 320. Which of your prelates wil follow Ambrose in his cōmentarie vpō the Apocalipse,

where he interpreteth the whore of Babylon to be the citie of Rome? whose wordes Bristow wil recite for me. This whore doth betoken in some places Rome in special, which then did persecute ye church of God: in some places in generall, the citie of the diuel, that is to saye, the whole body of the reprobat. Bristowe asketh if it be not a perillous point to touch the citie of Rome in saint Iohns time, when it did persecute the church of Rome? As though S. Iohn telleth a storie of his owne time, and not a prophecy of the time to come. Ambrose therfore, or whosoeuer writeth that cōmentarie, interpreteth that prophecy, Cap. 17. to be fulfilled of the citie of Rome: which was not onely of persecution, but of seduction. But the vndoubted Ambrose (if you remember, sayeth Bristowe) of the church of Rome sayeth: In al things I couet to followe the Romane church, De sac. lib. 3. Cap. 1. but yet that he was not bounde to followe the church of Rome, he sayeth immediately after: 
                     Sed tamen &amp; nos homine sensum habemus, &amp;c. But yet we being men, haue vnderstanding. Therefore, that which is more rightly obserued elsewhere, we also do rightly obserue. We follow the Apostle Peter him selfe, we sticke vnto his deuotion, what doth the church of Rome answere to this? Verily, Peter him selfe, which was a priest of the church of Rome, is author to vs of this assertion. In this Chapter he noteth an error of the church of Rome in yt they vsed not to wash mens feete in baptisme. Vniustly indeede, he vrgeth that ceremonie as necessarie, but yet he sheweth, that his iudgement was, that the church of Rome might receiue a custome contrarie to y• scripture.
               Beside this (saith Bristow) he calleth Peter the first &amp; the foundation in the verie same place, where say you, Pur. 320 he affirmeth, that Peter is not the foundation. Howsoeuer I deale with my reader, you deale vnfaithfully with me: for my wordes are these: He affirmeth ye not Peter, but the faith &amp; the confession of Peter, is the foundation of the church: and that the primacy of Peter was a primacie of faith, not of honour, of confession, not of autoritie or higher order. De incaern. dom. Ca. 4. &amp; 5.

Ambrose his words are, Cap. 4. 
                     Vos autem &amp;c. But what do you say of mee? Immediatly (Peter) being not vnmindful of his place, he exercised the primacy: The primacie of confessing truely, not of honor, the primacie of faith, not of order or degree. And Cap. 5. Faith is ye foundation of the church. For it was not said of Peters flesh, but of his faith, that the gates of death shal not preuailc against it, his confession ouercommeth hel. The former of these places, Brist. corrupteth by adding this worde, worldly, to the words of Ambrose, honor, &amp; degree, a
                     •
                   though Ambrose had meant, that Peter excelled in eccle siasticall honor &amp; degree, being equal to his fellowes in worldly honour and degree. But such folly was farr frō Ambrose, to say Peter was not better then the rest of the Apostles in worldly honor &amp; degree, when neither Peter nor the rest had any worldly honour or degree of dignitie at all. But he expresseth wherein all his primacie was, when he sayeth, he was first in confession, first in protestation of his faith, not being therefore of greater honor or higher degree then his fellowes, who all helde the same faith and confession. And this of Peters person, neuer a worde of his successours, which yet are not onely the bishops of Rome, when they were at the best, but all other bishops are the successors of the Apostles, Hierom, Euagrius which succession cannot be esteemed by places, in which the Apostles sat in person, but by authoritie of teaching receiued from them with soundnes of doctrine.
               
                  To the later place (Bristow saith) the diuel may preuaile against the fleshe of a Pope: but his faith, but his confession (as well in all articles that be nowe in cōtrouersie, as in those at that time) wil stand, when they shall all be sonke downe into their due place. But Saint Ambrose speaketh not of euery bishop of Romes faith and confession, but onely of the singular faith and confession of Peter: Thou art Christe the sonne of the liuing God, which is against all sectes and heresies. 
                     Dies me citius &amp;c. the day should sooner faile mee then the names of heretikes and diuers sectes. Yet this faith is generall against them all, that Christ is the

sonne of God both sempiternall of his father, and also borne of the virgine. Let nowe the reader iudge, whether of vs hath dealt more faithfully with Saint Ambrose.
               Fourthly he gathereth, that I saye in diuerse places: that Irenaeus, Polycrates, Dionysius, Alexandrinus, Cyprianus, the Councell of Africa, and Socrates the historiographer, did preach or write against the Popes authoritie, when it first began to aduance it selfe, in Victor, Cornelius Stephanus, Anastasius, Innocentius, Zozimus, Bonifacius &amp; Celestinus.
               To this Bristow answereth: First, that all these Popes by my confession were of the true church, therfore I am against my selfe in making other Popes to be antichrist, for claiming such authoritie as these did. Whereto I replye, the former bishops did but begin a little in comparison to discouer the mysterie of iniquitie, those later Popes that are antichrists, did openly shewe them selues in the temple of God as God, and therefore great difference. Secondly, Bristowe answereth, that all those writers did communicate with those Popes: therefore our separation cannot be excused. I replye, their ambitious vsurpation tended not to heresie, and therfore they were content to admonish them, but the latter Popes, from whome we dissent, are fallen into open heresie and apostasie. Thirdly, he saith, that no one of these writers wrote against the Popes authoritie, as he wil shewe of Irenaeus, Polycrates, Dionysius, &amp; Cyprian, Cap. 10. in 28. demaunde, where I will shewe that they did write against such vniust authoritie as those bishops did claime.
               Yet concerning Saint Cyprian in this place, hee sayeth, that hee exhorteth Cornelius to bee as stout in not loosing certeine African heretikes, as their owne bishop had beene in bynding of them. By which hee woulde haue men thinke, that Cornelius had authoritie to vndoe, that which Cyprian had done, as the Pope in these dayes taketh vpon him. But Cyprian yeldeth to no such authoritie, but maruelleth that Cornelius was anye thing moued with the threatening of

those heretiks, to receiue them into his chur
                     ••
                  , vnder pretence that Cyprian had not written to him immediatly of the constitution of Fortunatus a counterfeit bishop by a fewe heretikes, counting it sufficient that Cornelius knewe before, that they were excommunicated by the bishops of Africa, saying of their gadding to Rome, 
                     Cùm statutum sit, &amp;c. Seing it is decreede of vs all, and that it is meete &amp; also right, that euery mans cause shoulde be heard there, wher his crime is committed: and a portion of the flock is ascribed to euery pastor, which euery one should rule and gouerne as he will giue an account of his doing to the Lord, verily, they ouer whome we are set, must not gad about, nor with their subtile &amp; craftie rash, craze the concord of the bishops, which cleueth together. But there to plead their cause, wher both they may haue accusers &amp; witnesses of their crime, except to a fewe desperate men &amp; castawayes, the authoritie of the bishops placed in Africa seemeth to be lesse, which haue alreadie iudged of them, &amp; by the weight of their iudgement condemned their conscience bounde with the snares of many trespasses. Their cause already hath beene heard: the sentence is alreadie pronounced of them, neither is it congruent to the censure of priests to be reprehended by Leuits of mouable &amp; inconstant minde, &amp;c. You see that Cyprian meant nothing lesse, than to giue Cornelius bishop of Rome authoritie, to reuerse the sentence of the bishops of Africa, whose authoritie he iudged to be nothing lesse then the bishops of Rome or other places.
               Moreouer Bristow saith that Cyprian doth also note in S. Stephan some little negligence, but much more wilful obreption, in those two lapsed bishops of Spaine, Basilides &amp; Martialis, who had concealed from him the trueth, that in their supplication they should haue expressed, which because they did not, he saith well, that their restitution by the Pope could not stand them in steed against their former deposition by the bishop
                        •
                      of their owne prouince. This which so plainly maketh for the Popes authoritit (saveth Bristowe) you are so blinde to bring against it.
               
               Not so blinde but I can see, that you acknowledge

                   apsed bishops. But Cyprian sayeth not so, you hearde 
                     •
                  efore what his iudgement was of them that were condemned in one Prouince, that their sentence could not

                  e reuersed in another, but if they woulde returne to the Church, they should there be receiued vppon their 
                     •
                  epentance, where they were first condemned, and in this 4. Epistle he sayeth: 
                     Quare etsi, &amp;c. wherefore although some of our fellowe bishops there haue been (moste welbeloued brethren) which thinke the diuine discipline is to be neglected, and doe rashly communicate with Basilides and Martialis, this thing ought not to trouble our faith. You see, that he reproueth Stephanus and such as tooke his parte, for neglect of diuine discipline, in communicating with those heretikes which were lawfully condemned in their owne prouince, and therefore coulde not by any other bee restored.
               As concerning the Councels of Africa &amp; Mileuis, (sayeth Bristowe) the question between them and those other fiue Popes, was not about the matters of the vniuersall church, as for example, matters of faith. No was, is not the Popes authoritie of you counted a matter of faith, and of the vniuersall church? although they agreed in all other matters. But Bristow shameth not to say, it was not about the Popes authoritie in receiuing of bishops appeales, but what order the Nicene Councel had taken therein. As though that counterfeit Canon was not alledged, to iustifie the Popes authoritie in receiuing such appeales. But there are examples you saye, of appeales, and namely of the Patriarkes of Alexandria and Constantinople, but of which Patriarks &amp; to whom you shewe not. yea, S. Augustine him selfe, you say. vseth it as a plea: That Cecilianus was readie to pleade his cause before other churches out of Africa. Ep. 162.

This prooueth not, that Cecilianus, although trusting in the innocēcy of his cause, refused no indifferent iudges: yet that he appealed to the Church of Rome, and least of all to the singular iudgment of the Bishop of Rome, but to all other churches. And the appeales that were made in his cause were made to ye Emperour, and from ye Bishop of Rome, being once delegate of the Emperour to heare his cause with other Bishops, vnto him the seconde time, who gaue aliud uidicium Arelatense aliorum scilicet Episcoporum &amp;c. an other iudgement of A relate, of other Bishops, as it is plaine in the same Epistle.
               
                  But such appeales were lawfull, (saith Bristow) by the councell Sardicense cap. 7. in the same Carthage councell cap. 3. whose authoritie none of those Africane Bishops did denie, for the same Bishops were of it, that were of the Nicene: and Sainct Augustine chap. 7. did expresly admitte in the Canon of the inferiori appealing from their own
                        •
                      Bishops. In deede in the 3. chap. of the 6. Councell of Carthage, that forged Canon of Bishops appeales was aledged, which is nowe read for the 7. Canon of the Sardicense councell, but it was alledged as a canon of the Nicene Councell, and if it had beene a true canon of Sardica Councell, why did not those Bishops alledge it as a Canon of Sardica, as well as the other Canon of the inferiors appealing from their owne Bishop vnto the Bishops next adioyning, seeing the Bishops of Africa and S. Augustine himselfe, were so ready to yeelde to the authoritie of the Councell of Sardica. Therefore it appeareth, that the Canon of bishops appeales to Rome being first forged as a Canon of the Nicene Councell, when it could not find any setling there, was afterwarde foysted in the Sardicen Councell.
               
                  Thirdly (saith Bristow) these appeales were lawfull by the Nicene Councell also, wherevppon you say verie insolently trusting ouermuch your lying Lutherā frinds, the Magdeburgiens that S. Augustine &amp; his fellowes tooke those Popes with plaine forgery of the Canons of Nice, and fetched them ouer the coles meetely wel for it. Bristow will still defend yt forged Canon, for other there is none in the Nicen councell yt alloweth such appeales. As for ye Magdeburgiens I neuer read thē: but ye
                  
report of ye councels gathered by Peter Crab, I haue read 
                     〈◊〉
                   dosen yeares before I wrote against Allen. And in the end of the African Councel I read this Epistle of ye councell to Celestinus byshop of ye citie of Rome. Domino dilectissimo &amp; honorabili fratri Celestino, &amp;c. To our most welbeloued lord &amp; honorable brother Celestinus. We Aurelius, Palatinus, Antonius, Tutus, Seruus dei, Terentius, Fortunatus, Martinus, Ianuarius, Optatus, Celticius, Donatus, Theasius, Vincentius, Fortunatianus, and the rest which were present in ye vniuersal Africā councel of Carthage: We wold haue wished if as thy holynes hath insinuated by letters sent by our fellow elder Leo, that you reioyced of the comming of Appiarius: so we also might send with gladnes these writings of his purgation. Verily both our and your chearfulnes should be now more certaine, neither might seeme too much hasted and ouerspeedy which as yet had gon before aswell of one to bee heard as of one that is alredy heard. Surely when our ho ly brother, and fellow bishop, Faustinus came vnto vs, we gathered a Councell, and beleeued that he was therfore sent with him, that as by his helpe he had beene before restored to the Eldership, so rrow by his labour he might haue beene purged of so great crimes as are obiected by the Tabracenes, whose so great &amp; so heynous wicked factes, the examinatiō of the course of our councell hath found out; that the saide persons hoped for patronage rather then iudgment, and the aide of a defender rather then the iustice of an examiner. For first of al, how much he withstoode ye whole congregatiō, offering dayly diuers iniuries as one that mainteined ye priuileges of the Romaine Church, and that would be receiued into communion of vs, whom thy holynes (beleeuing that he had appealed, which he was not able to proue) had restored to the communion, which neuerthelesse was not lawfull, and thou maist know also better by the reading of the actes. Notwithstanding holding a most painfull iudgment by the space of three dayes, when being verie much troubled, wee inquired of diuerse thinges obiected vnto him, GOD the

righteous iudge, strong, and long suffering, to our great profite hath cutte off either the delayes of our fellowe Byshop Faustinus, or the craftie shiftes of Appiarius himselfe, by which hee went about to hide his filthinesse, not to bee named. For his more vile and stinking obstinacie being subdued, by which he would haue ouerwhelmed so great and filthie myre with impudencie, our GOD strayning his conscience, and publishing euen vnto men, the secrete crimes which he did alreadie condemne, which were as it were wrapped close in his hearte, sodainely this craftie denyer brake forth into confession of all the wicked factes that were obiected against him: And at length, of his owne accorde conuicted himselfe of all those incredible reproches, and turned into mourning euen our hope by which wee both beleeued and wished that hee might haue beene purged of so shamefull blottes, but that hee mitigated this our heauinesse, with one onely comfort that both he discharged vs from the labour of longer inquirie, and also prouided for his woundes such a medicine as it was, although it were by vnwilling confession, and his owne conscience striuing against it, our Lorde and brother. Therefore reseruing our dutie of due salutation wee earnestly desire you that henceforwarde you doe not easily admitte vnto your hearing, such as come from hence, nor that you wil any more receiue into communion those yt are excommunicated by vs, because your worship may easily perceiue, that this matter is also defined in the Nicene Councell. For although the prouision seeme to be there made of inferiour Clarkes, or lay men, yet howe much more woulde it, that the same shoulde be obserued concerning Byshops: that being suspended from the communion in their prouince, they shoulde not seeme by your holynesse, either ouerhastily or vnduely, to be restored to the communion. Also let your holynesse refuse the Iewde refuges, or shiftes of Priestes, and other clarkes as it is meete for you to do, because that by no decree of the fathers, this is taken away from the Church of

Africa, and the decrees of Nice haue most manifestly committed them, whether they bee clarkes of inferior degree, or whether they be Bishops themselues vnto their owne Metropolitanes. For most wisely and iustly they foresawe, that all businesses should be ended in their owne places where they began, and that the grace of the holy ghost, shoulde not be wanting to euery prouince, whereby equitie by the priests of Christ might both be seene wisely, &amp; also held most constantly, especially because it is graunted to euerie man, if he shalbe offended with the iudgement of them that shall heare his cause, to appeale to the Councels of his owne prouince, or else to a generall councell. Except peraduenture there be any man which beleeueth, that our GOD can inspire the iustice of examination and triall, into any one man whomsoeuer, and doth denie the same to innumerable priestes gathered together in councell. Or howe can the same iudgement giuen beyonde the sea, be stedfast and sure, vnto which the necessarie persons of witnesses, either for infirmitie of sexe, or of age, or for many other letts that may happen, cannot bee brought? for that any iudges shoulde be sent as it were from the side of your holynesse, we finde it decreed in no Synod of the fathers: For that decree which you sent vnto vs long agoe, by our saide fellowe Bishop Faustinus, as a decree of the Nicene councell, in the truer councell copies which are receiued of the Nicene councell, being sent vnto vs, out of the authenticall copie, by holy Cyrillus our fellowe Byshop of the Church of Alexandria, and by the worshipfull Atticus Byshop of Constantinople, which also haue beene sent from vs before this time, by Innocentius priest, and Marcellus subdeacon (by whom they were directed from them to vs) vnto Bishoppe Bonifacius of worshipfull memorie, your predecessour in which wee coulde finde no such matter. Also your clarks as executors of your commaūdemēts, neither send ye, nor graunt yee, to any that shall require them: least we should seeme to bring the smokie pride of the world, into the Church of Christ, which to them

that desire to see God, sheweth forth the light of simplicitie, and the day of humilitie, for touching our brother Faustinus (now that Appiarius a man to bee lamented is remoued out of the Church of Christ for his vnspeable wickednesse) we are sure that (sauing the honestie &amp; moderation of thy holinesse) thy brotherly loue will not suffer him to remaine any longer in Africa: And written with an other hande, our Lord preserue your ho lynesse, praying for vs in long life, Lorde brother.
               Thus haue I set downe the whole Epistle, though it be somwhat long, that the English reader may see, and iudge of ye whole matter in controuersie betweene ye Bishops of Rome, and all the bishops, of all the countries of Africa which was ye third part of the world, and howe truely Bristow first denyeth ye forgerie which was proued by copies sent from Alexandria &amp; Constantinople, out of ye authentical copie of the Councell of Nice. Secondly yt he saith ye same matter in questiō for appeales, was decreed by ye councell of Sardica, when this Epistle affirmeth, y•, by no decrees of any Synod, any such thing was appointed, but ye cleane contrary by the councell of Nice defined. Thirdly where he saith, those African fathers had smal cause to stand so much with the Popes in those appeales, that they shew great cause. Fourthly, where Bristow saith, that by this their doing nothing can be inferred against the Popes authoritie aboue prouinciall Councels, more then against a generall Councels authoritie aboue a prouinciall, when they shewe the last appeale to be permitted to any man that findeth himselfe grieued, vnto the general councels. Fiftly, where he saith yt popish kings &amp; bishops, at this day stand wt the Popes in ye right of giuing benefices, appeales &amp;c. with his owne good leaue, wtout any preiudice to his superiority, I aunswere, ye bishops of Africa, wtout the Popes leaue, &amp; against his wil, decreed, yt whosoeuer did appeale out of Africa, shoulde not be receiued into communiō of any in Africa. What the Pope of seruile feare is constrained at this day to yeald, least he shoulde be vtterly forsaken of all, as hee is of most, it is nothing to the purpose.
               
                  
But I am moste ridiculous, in Bristowes iudgement, where I alledge Socrates the Nouatian, speaking against Pope Celestinus, for taking away the Nouatians Churches in Rome, and counting it a point of forren Lordshippe, not of Priesthoode. Thus the Papistes defame such as write plainely against them, Eusebius they make an Arrian, Socrates a Nouatian, euen as he diffamed Saint Paule in the last Chapter, with much pricking of bodily lust. But what cause hath hee to charge Socrates with the heresie of Nouatus? He alledgeth none at al, neither is he able euer to proue the crime. In deed Socrates liuing at such time, as ye Nouatians ioyning in faith of the holy Trinitie with the Catholikes against the Arrians, Macedonians, and such other heretikes, were not so odious, speaketh lesse sharply of them, then of other heresies. Yet alwayes he accounteth them among heretikes: As Lib. 5. Cap. 19. Ab eo tempore quo Nouatiani, &amp;c. Euer since the time that the Nouatians departed from ye Church. Is it like that Socrates was a Nouatian, when he confesseth that they were departed from the Church? Likewise hauing spoken of the diuisions that were in the Catholike Churche, he commeth to speake of the schismes that were among heretikes, and nameth the Arrians, Nouatians, Macedonians and Eunomians Supr. &amp; Trip. Hist. lib. 9. cap. 36. Thus much for the credite of Socrates: nowe to the matter: where Bristowe saith, he counted it a point of forren Lordship to expell ye Nouatians, &amp;c it is false. But he sheweth the cause, why Celestinus coulde not preuaile to doe any good with them, his wordes are: Verumillos invidia corripuit Romano episcopai
                        •
                      iam olim perinde atque Alexandrino vltra Sacerdotii limites ad externum dominai
                        •
                     m progresso. But enuie tooke hold of them, because ye Bishoprik of Rome, long before euen as the Bishoprike of Alexandria, was proceeded beyond the bandes of Priesthoode into forren Lordship. Finally yt Socrates blameth the immoderate authoritie of S. Chrysostom, he doth it not alone, but other writers as much as he, &amp; Socrates reporteth more of his seuerity toward his own cleargie, thē toward ye Nouatiās of whō
                  
he was counted too much a fauourer, &amp; therfore Socrates writeth, that some iudged, that he was iustly deposed Eo quòd multas Ecclesias Novatianorum, Quartodecimanorū, &amp; aliorum tulisset haereticorum. Because he had borne with many Churches of the Nouatians, Quartodecimanes and other heretikes. Trip. Hist. lib. 10. cap. 20. Last of all whereas I alledged againste the Popes supremacie, the decree of the Aphrican councell Cap. 6. that no Bishoppe of the first see, should be called highest Priest, or Prince of Priests, but onely Bishop of the first see: Bristowe saith, it perteyneth onely to the Primates of Affrica, and concerneth not the titles, much lesse the primacie of the Bishop of Rome. But the trueth is, that it was made specially to represse the ambition of the Romane Prelates, and therfore in the end of the Canon, as it is conteined in the decrees, Dist. 99. cap. Primae. it is added, 
                     Vniversalis autem, nec etiam Romanus pontifex app
                           •
                        lletur, and let none, no not the Bishop of Rome be called vniuersall. By which it is manifest that his titles and authoritie also are commanded to be kept within their owne bounds, and not to be acknowledged to haue any thing to doe in the Churches of Affrica, by commandement or authoritie such as then was claymed. But the Affricanes (saith Bristowe) as appeareth in Saint Augustines workes, neuer called him Bishop of the first see, but Bishop of the Apostolike see. Although Saint Augustines workes can not bee witnesse, howe the Affricanes called him alwayes: yet what gayneth the Pope or Bristowe for him by this? What if they neuer called him primate or Bishop of the first see? (for other inferior Bishoppes were called Bishoppes of the second see.) The councel forbadde them to giue any other titles of authoritie beside this Bishop of the first see, it did not binde them that they should of necessitie call them by that title. For it was sufficient to cal them the Bishops of Carthage, of Alexandria, of Rome, of Antioche, &amp;c. And that they called the Romane Prelate Bishop of the Apostolike see of Rome, they gaue him no more authoritie ouer the Churches of Affrica, then when they

called the Bishop of Hierusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, or of any other Churches founded by the Apostles Bishoppe of the see Apostolike. Thus my Doctours (for any thing Bristowe can bring) remaine constant witnesses of my side, against the vsurped and Antichristian authoritie of the Bishop of Rome.
               
                  2 About onely faith. Bristo.
                  
                  I quoted Ambrose, Origen, and Cyprian, for iustification by faith only. To this Bristowe answereth Fulke. first generally, that hath satisfied these Doctors Cap. 8. Par. 4. that they meane a man may be iustified by faith, although before he was a Christian Catholike, he did no good works. But he cannot so escape, for they speake not only of the first conuersion, of a man, but of iustification vnto saluation of euerie faithfull man, according to the example of Abraham and Dauid, who both had good workes, yet were not iustified by them before God, but by theyr faith only. And Saint Paule expressely saith of himselfe, and all other Christians that were in his time, &amp; that shalbe in all times, that the example of Abrahams iustification is the example of his and their iustification: Rom. 4. Therefore his faith was imputed to him for righteousnesse, and it is not written for him onely, that it is imputed to him, but also for vs, vnto whō it shalbe imputed, which beleeue in him that raised vp Iesus from the dead, who was deliuered for our sinnes, and raysed againe for our iustification. I wish that Bristow in the next conference that he maketh, after the reading hereof, would marke this text with the circumstances of the persons of whom it is spoken, &amp; of ye temps in which the holy Ghost speaketh, that faith shalbe imputed for righteousnes. In the meane time, I must proue that these fathers speake generally of all Christians and the only way of iustification, and not of newe conuerts only, and of the instinct of their baptisme or newe conuersion onely, but that they are iustified by faith vnto eternall saluation.
                  
                     
First Origen, after he had brought the example of the theefe iustified by faith only, bringeth in the example of the sinnfull woman. Luk. 7.

For no worke of the lawe, but for faith only, he saith vnto her, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee: And againe, thy faith hath saued the, goe in peace, But also in many places of the Gospell we reade, that our Sauiour vsed this speache, that he saith, the faith of the beleeuer, is the cause of his saluation. By all which it is cleare, that the Apostle iudgeth, rightly that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the lawe. See you not that iustification is not only to sett a man in free will, discharged of his sinnes committed before baptisme, but continueth with him vnto saluation? Also where I saide that Origen answereth this obiection, which the Papists make against vs, for teaching iustification by faith only, (though Bristowe say it is false) it is very true Lib 3. Cap 3. in epi. ad Rom. Sed fortassis, &amp;c. but peraduenture some body hearing this, may become idle and negligent in doing good workes, if only faith suffice to iustification. Is not this one of the Papists obiections? Againe that this doctrine of iustification perteineth only to them yt are newly conuerted to Christianity, against which Origen sheweth by example of the Pharisee trusting in himselfe that he was righteous, and boasting thereof. Luk 18. that it perteyneth to all men, that boasting may be excluded, and that none boast in any thing, but in the crosse of Christ,  
                        Vides Apostol
                              〈…〉
                            non gloriantem, &amp;c. Thou seest the Apostle not glorying of his righteousnes, nor of his chastity, nor of his wisdome, nor of his other vertues and acts, but most manifestly pronouncing and saying, let him that gloryeth glory in the Lorde, &amp;c. and so at length sheweth, that all this doth verifie the saying of the Apostle, we iudge that a man is iustified by faith, without the workes of the law, which before he had interpreted by faith only, whether they haue no works going before as the theefe,

the sinfull woman, or whether they haue workes of the lawe without the faith of Christe, as the Pharisee, or whether they haue neuer so many workes and vertues with the faith of Christe, as the Apostle Paule, there is but one way of iustification, for all men, which is by remission of sinnes, through faith onely. Where Cyprian saith: that faith onely profiteth Ad Quirin. Cap. 42. Bristowe saith, he meaneth that faith profiteth, and without faith nothing profiteth. I confesse in deede he meaneth all that Bristowe saith, and more too, namely that faith profiteth, therefore workes do not profite vnto iustification, as appeareth by that testimony of Scripture which he citeth, to proue his saying: Abraham beleeued God, and it was imputed to him for iustice. Gen. 15. By which Saint Paule proueth, that Abraham was iustified by faith without workes, and yet Abraham was not voyde of good workes. Out of the Booke De duplici Martyrio I cited Cyprians saying: That he beleeueth not in God at all, which placeth not the trust of all his felicity in him only. To this Bristowe answereth without shame, that the Booke De duplici Martyrio is thought to be supposition, coyned by Erasmus: as though it were credible that Erasmus being such an vtter enemy to all forgery and supposition, would himselfe counterfet a booke vnder the name of Cyprian. But Bristowe doubting, least he may be conuicted by auncient copies of this booke, remaining in Libraries, as no doubt, but that he may, for a second aunswer saith, That this sentence is of it selfe Catholike inough. For to trust Gods giftes, as in the Catholike faith, and good workes that he worketh in vs, also to trust in Saints: to trust in these, I say, as they be his, is to trust in him onely.
                  
                  I say, (sayeth Bristowe,) what neede we further witnesse or reason? But Christe telling a parable, against them that trusted in themselues, that they were righteous, telleth of a Pharisee, that trusted in his woorkes, as they were the giftes of GOD, to whome hee gaue thankes for them. Luke. 18.

This auctority of Bristowe is inough to discharge Pelagius, Celestinus, and all the rable of freewill men, who trusted in nothing, but that was the gift of God, and so acknowledged by them, in so much as they confessed, that a man was iustified by the grace of God, when he was iustified by his owne workes, because God gaue free will, and power to worke well, also a law by keeping whereof, men might be righteous. Finally this rule of Bristowe, will iustifie a man, which putting his trust in Angels, worshippeth them as Gods Angells, yea which putting his trust in any of Gods creatures, trusteth in him alone. So that nothing is so singular, but he can make it generall, nor any thing so generall, but he can restrayne it at his pleasure.
                  Now yt Ambrose also extendeth the grace of iustification by faith only vnto eternal saluation, it is manifest as generally throughout his commentarie vppon the Epistle to the Romanes, so notably in 1. Cor. Cap. 1. vpon these wordes of the Apostle, I thank my God alwaies for you, for the grace of God which hath bene giuen you in Christ Iesu. 
                        Datam dicit, &amp;c. He saith this grace which hath bene giuen you in Christ Iesus, which grace is so giuen in Christ Iesus, because this is decreed of God that he which beleueth in Christ, should be saued, without workes, obtaining freely remission of sinnes, by faith only. Also in Praef. ad Gall. a praedicatione, &amp;c. that from the preaching of Iohn, the lawe doth cease, that only faith may suffice vnto saluation, which is an abridgment of the law. Likewise 
                        
                           Exhortatione ad virgines: Videtis mysteria, &amp;c. you see the mysteries, you see the grace of Christ, the grace of the holy Ghost, which is deliuered as it were by a certaine lot, because not of workes, but of faith, euery one is iustified of the Lorde. For as the falling out of the lott, is not in our power, but is such, as chaunce hath brought, so the grace of our Lorde, is not as it were of the merite of hire, but is deliuered, as of his will. This writeth Ambrose of al that are partakers of the grace of God, and not of them that are newly baptised or conuerted only. Againe

in the same Booke, he saith, speaking of all men that attaine to saluation, 
                        Hîc quidem luctamur, sed alibi coronamur, &amp;c. here truly we do wrestle, but in an other place we are crowned. I haue spoken not of my selfe only, but of all men generally. For whence should I haue so much merite, to whom pardon is in steed of a crown? What can be said more plainly, to exclude the merite of good workes from iustification? whereas the reward of good workes that is freely giuen to the iustified man by faith only, both Ambrose and we doe neuerthelesse acknowledge.
               
               
                  3. About Purgatorye. Touching Scriptures expounded against Bristowe. it.
                  He sayeth I am taken in a vaine bragge, because Fulke. I beeing vrged by Allen, to bring any Scripture expounded by any of all antiquity against prayers for the dead, I bring only Hierom, referring the reader to other places of Cyprian, and Origen, and other cited in diuerse places of my booke. These places he saith, are but bare names. But when we come to expounding of these places, we shall finde, eyther reason or auctority of these Doctors for vs. In the meane time, we will consider Hieronyme, whom Bristowe saith, that I confesse to haue allowed prayers for the deade: Wherein he saith vntruly, for I neuer confessed simply, that he allowed prayers for the deade: But Pur. 194. I saide interrogatiuely and by waie of concession, Howe hapeneth it yt Chrysostome and Hieronyme, which both interpreted that place, could gather no such matter, although they otherwise allowed prayer for the deade? And indeede in so many bookes of Hieronyme nothing can be found whereby it may be proued, that he allowed prayer for the deade, although it were a common error of many in his time. And in this place cited in the decrees by Gratia
                        •
                     . 139. 2. he simply denieth that any prayers are profitable for the deade.
                  The place in deede as (Bristowe saith) is in his Comment.

vpon Gal. 6. although he in exposition allude to 2. Cor. 5. we must all appeare before the iudgment seate of Christe. But the answere of this place of Hierome, Bristowe saith, I might learne of the glose, which expoundeth it of them that die without repentaunce only, but in deede it is spoken generally of all men. As the very wordes declare vpon this texte, Euery one shall beare his owne burthen. 
                        Videtur superioribus contrair

He seemeth to goe against the former sentence, where he sayth: Beare the burthens one of an other: For if euerie one shall beare his owne burthen, one cannot beare the burthens of an other. But we must consider that there he commanded, that we which cōmit sinne, should in this life helpe one an other, and in this present worlde should be an aide one to an other: but here hee speaketh of the iudgment of the Lorde vpon vs: that not of other mens sinn, or of comparison of the worser, but according to our own worke, we shalbe iudged of him, either sinners or holy, euery one receiuing according to his owne worke.

                            sententiolam, nouum dogma quod latitat: We are taught by this short sentence though darkely, a newe doctrine, or opinion whiche lyeth hidde: that while we are in this present worlde, we may helpe one another, either by prayers or by counsels: but when we shall come before the iudgement seate of Christe, that neither Iob, nor Dauid nor Noe can intreate for any man, but that euerie one doth beare his owne burthen. That which Hierome speaketh of himselfe, and of all other, that prayers can not auaile them, beeing out of this world, when the glose restreyneth onely to them that die in mortall sinne, without repentance, it is as good as the olde iest, Statuimus, id est abrogamus. It is also worthy to be considered that Hierome as it seemeth against the errour of his time, calleth this a newe doctrine which he gathereth of that sentence.
                  That the moste auncient doctours doe not interprete the Scriptures by name against Purgatorie, I said it was because Purgatorie in their time was neither heard nor

named. Bristowe replyeth, that I confessed Cap. 3. that the olde doctours heard both the name and the thing, &amp;c. Thus he chargeth me still with confessions falsely. For although Augustine heard of the name of Purgatorie, whereof he sometimes doubteth, sometimes denyeth all places but two, yet no writer before him. Neither were prayers for the dead heard in the Churche, before the heresie of Montanus. But to returne to Hierome, whom I saide in Eccle. 11. to expound the North and South, not for the states of grace and wrath, but for the places of rewarde or punishment: Bristowe sayeth of both. But I denie that he speaketh of the state of grace, in that sort that Allen meaneth: namely, that any man so dieth in the state of grace, that he obteineth release of punishment after this life, which is the matter in question, but that Bristowe is disposed to cauill. For although a man in this life, may be remoued out of the North into the South, yet when the tree is fallen, there is no more remouing by Hieroms iudgement. Wheresoeuer thou preparest thee a place, and a seate hereafter, whether it be in the South, or in the North, there when thou art dead, thou shalt continue. This whiche the Doctor speaketh expressely of a place, a seate of euerlasting continuance, Bristow for want of a better answere, expoundeth of merite, as though it might stande with Hieronyms authoritie, that the place might be changed although the merite can not be bettered.
               
               
                  Touching scriptures for Purgatorie and prayer for the dead, whether the Doctours say, No Scripture to make for it. Bristow

                        .
                  
                  I said that Tertullian confesseth, yt oblations &amp; prayers for the dead were not taken of the scriptures but of tradition. Bristow in diuers places denieth any such confession of Tertullian, restraining his meaning to an onely ceremonie of oblation and prayers on the yeares day of their departure: as though oblation and prayer for ye dead generally, were clearly taught in ye scriptures,

which thing if it be: why doth not Allen or Bristowe, or any writer yong or olde, bring one place out of the canonicall Scriptures, allowing prayer and oblation for the deade? and as touching Tertullian, his wordes are such, as with no equity may be restrained to so particular a ceremonie: 
                        Oblationes pro defunctis, pro natalitiis, annua die facimu

                         for to celebrate the yearly festiuity of mens birth, was vsual among the Gentiles, euery man for himselfe. But to obserue the yearely day of al mens death were infinite, either for their friends or for the Priests to doe. Wherefore it remaineth, that oblations for the dead, what soeuer they were in Tertullians time, were not taken of the Scriptures. And if they were Masse and prayers for the dead, as the Papistes say, Masse and prayers for the dead are not taken out of the Scriptures by Tertullians confession.
                  The contradictions that he layeth to me, I alwayes reserue to their peculiar Chapter. Augustine also denyeth a third place to be found in the Scriptures, D

Ser. 33 For praying for the dead, he alledgeth the tradition of the fathers, which he is not wont to doe, where scripture doth not faile him. Epiphanius likewise against Aerius bringeth no Scripture, but the custome and tradition of the Churche in naming the dead in their prayers. And which of the olde writers except Chrysostome, once goeth about to alledge Scripture for prayer for the dead? Wherefore I made no vaine bragge in saying most of the olde writers, that defende such prayers, confessed they had them not of the Scriptures.
               
               
                  
                  Of certaine particular textes. Bristowe.
                  
                  I saide that Saint Augustine is cleare, that the text (1. Fulke. Cor. 3. of him that shalbe saued through fire) proueth not Purgatorie, affirming, that it is meant of the fire of tribulation in this life. Bristowe cauilling, that he affirmeth not, but speaketh doubtfully, &amp;c. saith that he onely sheweth it ought not to be expounded, after the heresie of the Origenistes of hell fire. But Augustines wordes are plaine: 
                        Ignis enim de quolocutus est eo loco Apo
                           
                              •
                           tolus, talis debet intelligi, vt ambo per eum transeant, &amp;c. For the fire whereof the Apostle in that place speaketh, ought to be vnderstoode such, that both may passe thorough it, that is, both he that buildeth vpon this foundation, Golde, Siluer, pretious stones, and he also which buildeth Woode, Strawe, Stubble. For when he had saide this, he added: The fire shal trie euerie mans work, such as it is, if any mans worke remaine, that which he hath builded vpon, he shall receiue rewarde: But if any mans worke be burned, he shall suffer losse, but he himselfe shalbe saued, yet so as it were through fire. The fire truely, is the tentation of tribulation, of which it is manifestly written in an other place, The fornace proueth the potters vessels, and tentation of tribulation, iust men. This fire in this present life, worketh that which the Apostle saith, &amp;c. By this you see that fire interpreted of tribulation in this life, &amp; denied to be spoken of Purgatorie fire, thorough whiche by their owne consent all men do not passe. Againe he speaketh not at all, against the Origenistes opinion of hell fire, that it shall haue an end, but against such as in his time did holde, That they which forsake not the name of Christ, and are baptised with his lauer in the Church, and are not cut off from it by any schisme or heresie, although they liue in neuer so great wickednes, which they neither wash away by repenting, nor redeemed with almes, but continue most stubburnely in them vnto the end of this life, shalbe saued through fire, although they be punished according to the greatenesse of their sinnes and

wickednesse with long, but yet not eternal fire. But they which beleeue this, &amp; yet are catholikes, seeme to me to be deceiued by a certeine humane beneuolence. For the holy scripture being consulted, answereth another thing &amp;c. 
                           Enc. ad Laurentium. C. 67.
                      Thus his reasons are against a temporal purging fire, through which some should passe &amp; not all, therfore against the popishe purgatorie, although he denye not but such a thing may be, yet it cannot be proued by this place, nor by any other place of scripture, as hereafter we shall see more at large in ye 3. diuision of this chapter, where Bristowe promiseth I wot not what, to shewe of Augustines iudgement for Purgatorie. I answered Allen, apposing vs, where we had that new meaning of our sauiours wordes, that he which is cast into prison for neglecting of reconciliation while he is in the way, is cast into hell, from whence he shal neuer come, I alledged for that sense Chrysostome, Augustine, Hierom, &amp; Chromatius. This is passing childish (saith Bristow:) For D. Allen demaundeth no such thing. But this in deede is passing impudence: for Allens words in the same diuision (after he hath posed Caluin, Flaccus, Luther, Iewel, about their interpretation of scriptures, are these: But I will not make a reckoning of their vnseemely gloses, I would their followers would only but aske them in all matters, from whence they had such newe meanings which they falsely father on Gods word. Nowe the whole discourse of that Chapter as appeareth by the title, is of that place, Math. 5. Pur. 132. Yet saith Bristow, it is not true, that all those doctors haue that sense, which I affirme them to haue. But he only saith it, let their wordes be read, Pur. 145. Where Allen alloweth all interpretations of the place, 1. Cor. 3. so long as they affirme no error: I sayde he may by the same reason allowe contradictories to be true. As in that saying, Matth. 5. of him that shall not come out, vntill he haue payde the vttermost farthing, some haue expounded, that he shall alwayes be punished: some, that hee shall not be alwayes punished. Howe is it possible that both these interpretations can be true? Mary (sayth Bristow, with

as fine Rhetorike, as strong Logike:) Thus it is true, those he and he, are not one he: but he that shalbe alwayes punished, is he, that to the end of the way, that is this life, agreeth not with his aduersarie, whome he hath deadly iniuryed, as saying to him, fatue, and thereby incurring the guylt of Gehennae ignis, which i
                           •
                         the prison of the damned. He that shal not be alwayes punished, is he whose iniury was but veniall, as Racha. And so both interpretations agree well, not onely together, but also with the text it selfe. In deede, this is a fine distinction of he and he: but that hee which agreeth not with his aduersarie in the way, shalbe cast into prison, from whence he shall neuer come, whatsoeuer the matter were betwixt them, there is but one prison, from whence there is no deliuerance, vntil the last farthing be payde, which by those doctors exposition, is neuer payde. Whether the iniurie be greater or lesser, the punishment is eternall, without reconciliation, or as Saint Luke sayeth, diligence to be reconciled. If thou being readie to offer thy gifte at the altar, doest remember that thy brother hath any thing against thee, goe and reconcile thy selfe, sayeth Christe, and agree quickly with him while thou art in the waye. Marke that hee speaketh of all iniurie euen offered by anger, or saying Racha, and not onely of saying Fatue. But as for, that he, which agreeth with his aduersary while he is in the way, what trespasse soeuer hee hath done him, he is not at all committed to prison, were his iniurie great or small. So that which He soeuer commeth into prison, there is no waye of escape, vntill hee haue payde the vttermost farthing, which debt is alwayes in paying and neuer discharged.
                  
                     Secondly, whether the doctors giue any other kinde of testimonie 
                     Bristowe. 
                     against vs.
                  
                  
                     First, about the booke of Machabees.
                  
                  Where I sayde, that Allen pretendeth to proue the Fulke. booke of Machabees by authoritie of the church, when hee cannot by consent that it hath with the scriptures of GOD: Bristowe replyeth, as though

all bookes are canonicall which haue consent with the Scriptures. Fulk reioyneth, that hee vnderstandeth not his argument so, but that which hath not consent with other canonicall bookes, is not canonicall.
                  Where I take exception, to the Councel of Carthage, which numbreth this booke among the canonical scriptures, as a Councell prouinciall: Bristowe sayth, it was by my confession confirmed in the sixt generall Councell of Constantinople in Trullo, therfore it hath ye authoritie of the whole true church. But I tooke no exception to the generalitie therof. But let it be as generall as you will, both that and the Councel in Trullo erred by your owne iudgement, seeing Carth. 3. Ca. 26. decreed against the authoritie of the Romane prelate, euen by name, as Gratian witnesseth, Dist. 99. That in Trullo condemned Pope Honorius for a Monothelite heretike Art. 16. &amp; 17. Beside this, I alledge, that this Councel of Carthage 3. among Canonicall Scriptures, nameth fiue bookes of Salomon, whereas the church alloweth but three. Bristowe answereth out of Augustine (which hee saith was one of the Councell) that the booke of wisedome and Ecclesiasticus, of a certeine similitude, were called Salomons bookes, whereas they were written by Iesus the sonn of Syrach, although the former he retract in rest. li. 2. Ca. 4. I aske no better to proue the errour of the Councell, but that they named fiue of Salomon for three. Secondly, it appeareth by Augustine which was one of the Councell, yt although they called these books canonical, yet they meant them not to be of equall authoritie with the rest of the scriptures, 
                        
                           Aug. cōtra Gaudent. lib. 2. Ca. 23. And this scripture of the Machabees, ye Iewes count not as the Lawe &amp; the Prophets &amp; the Psalmes, to whome our Lord giueth testimonie as to his witnesses, saying, it behoueth that all things should be fulfilled yt are writtē of me in ye law &amp; in yt Prophets &amp; in ye Psalms. But it is receiued of the church not vnprofitably, if it be soberly read &amp; heard. Bristowe saith I ascribe vnto S. Augustine. yt which he reporteth of the Iewes, when I say that he alloweth them not in full authoritie wt the law,

the Prophets &amp; the Psalmes: fraudulently omitting, that which I cited out of Augustine in the continued sentēce that our Sauiour Christ appealeth to these onely witnesses, namely the law, the Prophets &amp; the Psalmes, &amp; so the Iewes by ancient tradition, diuide all the canonical bookes into these three orders. Secondly, where I note yt Augustine alloweth not these bookes wtout condition of sobrietie in the reader or hearer: Brist. saith, that all Catholikes &amp; S. Peter do require ye same condition in ye reader of the whole scriptures, as S. Augustine doth in the Donatistes, which defended the murthering of thēselues by example of Rasis out of the Machabees. Wherunto I reply, yt although sobrietie be required in al readers of ye holy scripture, &amp; other writings also: yet it is not required, as a condition making ye scriptures to be profitably receiued of ye church, if they be soberly read: for howsoeuer ye canonicall scriptures be read, &amp; by whomsoeuer, although he be mad &amp; drunk yt readeth or heareth them, yet are they not only profitably, but also necessarily receiued of the church, but this scripture of ye Machabes (saith Augustin) it is receiued not vnprofitably, if it be soberly read or heard. Who seeth not a gret difference between this scripture receiued vnder condition, &amp; the canonical scripture authorized by Christ him selfe? But Augustine (saith Brist.) &amp; the Councel, call these canonical, de doct. Chr. li. 2. Ca. 8. In that place Augustine nameth al that by any church are counted canonical, confessing in a maner as Bristow granteth, that they were not all generally receiued of the whole church, &amp; therfore instructeth ye studēt of diuinitie to prefer some before others. The reasons that I brought to proue this booke, not to be canonical, are these, first because ye author cōmendeth Rasis for killing himself, which is contrary to Gods commaundment. Bristow answereth out of Augustine, yt the scripture hath only told it, &amp; not cō
                     mended it. But the place is manifest, 2. Mach. 14. that the author of ye booke doth not only report his murthering of him self, but also doth highly cōmend his manfulnes therin, willing (saith he) rather to dye valiantly, than to

giue him selfe into the hands of wicked men, &amp; to suffer reproch vnworthie for his noble stock, &amp; so forth to the ende of the Chapter. Secondly, I said, that writer abridgeth the fiue bookes of Iason: but the holy ghost maketh no abridgement of other mens writings. Bristowe sayth, the booke of Kings in many places abridgeth stories, telling where they be written in other bookes that are not canonicall. To this I answere: the holy ghost abridgeth not the stories written by the spirite of man, but for ciuile affaires, sendeth the reader to other writers, seeing they are out of his purpose to writ of them. Furthermore he sayeth, S. Marke is commonly called the Abridger of S. Matthewe, I aunswere, not so cōmonly, as falsly, for many things he rehearseth more largely then S. Mathewe, and something he vtterly omitteth, which is not the office of a true abridger. And albeit yt he did, it were no answere to mine obiection, yt because the spirite of God telleth shortly, that which he himself had told at large, as in the Actes, the sermons of the Apostles, he is an abridger of Chronicles written by prophane men. The citing of the saying of Poets, Act. 17. &amp; Tit. 1. proueth not that the holy ghost intending to write an historie of the church, vseth the labour of ye prophane man Iason the Cyrenian. I trow it is one thing to cite a verse or a piece of a verse to confute men by their owne receiued witnesses, another thing to bring fiue bookes of an historie into one. Thirdly I sayd, the author of that booke confesseth, that he toke that matter in hand, that men might haue pleasure in it, which could not away with the long tedious stories of Iason. But the spirit of God serueth not such vaine delightes of men. Brist. asketh, if profitable breuitie be a vaine delight? but I speake not of the breuitie, but the cause why he affected breuitie, namely, that men might haue pleasure in his worke. Fourthly, I said, the author sheweth what labor &amp; sweat it was to him to make this abridgement, ambitiously cōmendeth his trauell, &amp; sheweth the difference between a storie at large, &amp; an abridgement, all which things sauour nothing of Gods spirit. Also he

confesseth his infirmitie, and desireth pardon if he haue spoken slenderly and barely, whereby hee testifieth sufficiently, yt he was no scribe of ye holy ghost. Bristow saith (that he ambitiously commendeth his trauel) is but my blasphemy, all ye rest standeth well ynough with the assistance of ye holy ghost. Concerning his ambitious cōmendation of his trauel, where to serueth his great cōplaint of ye great labour, sweat, &amp; watching ye it cost him? &amp; the wise similitude yt he taketh of him that maketh a feast, &amp; seeketh other mens commoditie, &amp; hath no smal sauor: so we also for many mens sake (saith he) are very well content to vndertake this great labour. A great labour I promise you, and to great profite of many. Likewise in the ende, a passing good similitude of wine, to finishe his booke which hee beganne with a feast. As it is hurtfull to drinke wine alone, and then againe water; and as wine tempered with water is pleasant, and delighteth the taste: so the setting out of the matter deliteth the eares of them that reade the storie. But to the rest, Bristowe asketh, if the scribes of the holy ghost, must bee alwayes eloquent, or able to doe all without sweat or labour? I aunswere, as vaine eloquence is not profitable for them, so they neuer complain for the lack of it, but spirituall vtterance they haue abundantly, and that without sweat and watching, whē they write as the spirite of God doth moue them. Neither doth S. Paul confesse, yt he lacketh vtterance, when he said he was rude in speaking: 2. Cor. 11. but rehersed what the false Apostles did obiect against him, for otherwise his speech was so eloquent in diuine eloquence, yt he was of the pagans at Lystra taken for Mercurie. Act. 14. Neither doth hee excuse his boldnes writing to the Romans, as Bristowe saith blasphemously, but sheweth that he was bold, vpō his office, because he was ye minister of Christ vnto the gentils. Ro. 15 That he vsed ye hand of Tertius in writing yt Epistle, or any other, it was not to auoid ye labor of endi ting: Finally, yt he vsed intollerable paines in preaching, It proueth not, yt it cost him great labor, &amp; trauel in studying, what to write or preach either, which ye spirit of

God did minister vnto him plentifully: But neuer doth he craue pardon, as one vncerteine whether he haue don well or no, as the writer of the Machabees doth, confessing in the end that he hath done as wel as he could, and in the beginning, leauing to the author ye exact diligēce of euery particular, so submitting his labour as inferior in perfection to the worke of Iason the Cyrenian. That I speake not of so many falshods and fables as hee affirmeth for truth, which are refelled both by the former book of Machabees and by Iosephus.
                  Where Allen alleged ye authority of Ierom in Prol. Mac. I said I knew not what place he noted therby, for in S. Ieroms works none such is found: now commeth Bristow, &amp; telleth me it is in a preface before the booke of Machabees, in ye vulgar latine Bybles, taken out of ye sēse of Ierom, as diuers of those prefaces be, and that wil appeare by these two places, which I cite out o
                        •
                      him to proue yt booke not canonicall: The former is in his preface vpon ye book of kings, where rehersing ye names of the canonical books, he omitteth this, and after saith expresly it is not in the Canon. Bristow aunswereth, it is not in the Canon of the Hebrewes. As though the church of God, since Christ shoulde haue more bookes of the olde testament in ye canon, then ye church of the Hebrews had. Ierom saith yt this preface of his, may be set before al the books which he hath translated out of Hebrew into latin, 
                        v
                              •
                            scire valeamus, quicquid extrahos est, inter Apocripha esse ponendū. That we may be able to know yt whatsoeuer is beside these, is to be placed among ye apocriphall writings. So yt Ierom speaketh expresly, yt not onely among the Iewes, but among Christians also these &amp; al other books without ye canon, are to be taken for apocriphall.
                  The other place of Ierom is in his preface vppon the prouerbs, that they were neither in the Churches canon. Therefore euen as the church readeth in deede ye bookes of Iudeth, Tobias &amp; Machabees, but yet receiueth them not among the canonicall scriptures: so also these two books Ecclesiasticus and Sapientia, she may reade to the edifying of the people, but not to confirme the authoritie

of the churches doctrin: To wit (saith Bristow) against the Iewes, as though ye Churches doctrin, is not to be cō
                     firmed against heretikes, and euen to ye Catholiks themselues, by authoritie of the canonicall scriptures.
                  That Augustine accounteth these bookes canonicall, after a sort, it was of me confessed, and therefore needed none other testimonies as Bristow bringeth, de praed. sanct. &amp; de ciuit. Dei lib. 18. cap. 36.
                  But Ierom is also cited in his preface vpon ye booke of Iudith to affirme the booke of Iudith to be canonicall by the councell of Nice: if that were so, what pertaineth it to the book of Machabees? But in deede it is not so: for though we shoulde doubt nothing of the credit of that preface in Iudith, the words are these: With ye Hebrewes the booke of Iudith is redde among ye hagiographaor books called holy writings, whose authoritie to strengthen those things yt come in controuersie, is iudged lesse conuenient: yet being written in the Chaldee tongue, it is counted among the stories. But because the Synod of Nice is redde to haue accounted it in the number of holy scriptures, I haue yelded to your request, &amp;c.
                  
                  First he saith it was reade of the Hebrewes among the Hagiographa, which is false, as Hierom affirmeth Prolog. Gal. in lib. reg. Secondly, as Erasmus hath noted, he affirmeth not, that this booke was allowed by the Nicē councell, but saith it is read to haue accounted perhaps in some such writer, as coyned the canon sent vnto the Aphrican councell. Thirdly, if we shall vnderstand Hagiographa heere as Bristowe woulde haue them, not for those nine that be canonicall, but others that be Apocriphal, &amp; yet holy writings, why shoulde we not likewise say, yt the computatiō of ye Nicen councel, was to receiue it among such Apocriphall holy writings, and not among ye canonical scriptures of irrefragable authoritie? And therfore Fulke is euen where he was before, in saying yt Ierom doth simply refuse ye books of ye Machabees, &amp; saith ye church receiueth thē not for canonicall, &amp; euen that which Bristow saith, I should haue shewed, that the church neither did then nor ought afterwards to receiue

them, that we might be able to know (saith he) speaking I dare say of himselfe &amp; all other members of ye Church, that whatsoeuer books are without ye Canō of ye Hebrews are to be taken or placed among the apocriphal: where I saide that Luther and Illyrieus were not the first that doubted of the Epistle of Saint Iames, but Eusebiu: before them, saith plainly it is a counterfait, protesting that I speake it not to excuse them yt doubt of it, Bristo
                        •
                      is not content, except I woulde condemne thē for heretikes, which afterwarde reuersed their error, especially Luther. Also he chargeth me to be a falsarie of Eusebius, in saying that he refuseth that Epistle as a counterfeite, when he saith the cleane contrary, and so rehearseth the words of Eusebius, I know not out of whose translation But ye words of Eusebius are 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : It must bee knowne that it is a bastard or counterfeit.
               
               
                  2 About onely scripture. Bristowe.
                  
                  I said Cyprian would haue nothing done in the celebration Fulke. of ye lords supper, &amp; namely in ministring of the cup, but that Christ himselfe did. lib. 2. Ep. 3. Bristow answereth ye he writeth against ye Aquarians which offered water only, wher as Christ offered wine, which was clean against Christs doing. And what is your sacriledge, in robbing of ye church of Christ of the whole cup? is it not cleane contrary, both to his doing &amp; his cōmaundemēt, drinke ye al of this, and such doing as he did for a tradition vnto vs, when ye Apostle rehersing yt tradition reherseth drinking of the Lords cup by ye lay, as well as eating of ye bread? As for mingling wine with water, which first was but a custome of sobriety, after grew into a ceremonie, if Cyprian should vrge of necessitie, he might be answered by his owne rule.
                  Likewise where Chrysostom saith, it was decreed by the Apostles yt in the celebration of the holy misteries, a remembrance should be made of them yt are departed, I said we wil be bold to charge him wt his owne sayings: first Hom de Adam &amp; He
                           •
                        a: satis sufficere, &amp;c. wee thinke it sufficeth ynough whatsoeuer the writings of ye Apostles haue taught vs according to the foresaid rule, insomuch

that we count it not all catholike whatsoeuer shall appeare contrary to the rules appointed.
                  By this Bristow seeth, yt I am a great reader of the doctors. For whosoeuer made this homily (saith he) he took those words out of ye instructions which followeth the Epistle of Pope Celestinus, in the first tome of councels, where the wordes are not, the writings of the Apostles but the writings of ye see apostolike, which are thought sufficient. Whatsoeuer my reading be, for the maker of the Homily, I cannot depose, but I trust he will not deny, but it hath in al printed books gone vnder the name of Chrysostom, and it containeth nothing vnworthy the iudgement of Chrysostom. It is therefore more like that Celestinus or whosoeuer gathered that instruction, borrowed those words out of this homily, and from ye writings of the Apostles peruerted them to the writings of the see apostolike, many such borrowing &amp; peruersions are commonly found in those pontifical Epistles. For admit that not Chrysostom, but some later man made that Homily which borrowed such words out of yt Epistle or instruction: Why did he alter them, if hee thought the writings of the apostolike see sufficient, to approue all catholike doctrine? except perhaps his copie had also apostolica scripta, &amp; that copie which Peter Crab followed in gathering the councels is corrupted. Certaine it is, the homily is auncient, and made in the time when the Pelagian heresie begun to spring, which was in the later time of Chrysostom, &amp; therfore I haue vsed no fraude, or misdemeanour in citing this saying for Chrysostoms, wherto Bristow maketh no answere, but denyeth the authority. Likewise wher I cite out of Chrysost. in Ge. Ho. 58. Thou seest into how great absurdity they fall which will not follow ye Canon or rule of ye holy scripture, but permit al to their owne cogitations. Bristow answereth nothing, but yt Chrysost. answereth heretikes which said our Lord took not ture flesh: as though his sētēce is not general against al heretiks which go besid the scripture. Thirdly I saide, if we be further vrged, we wil allege yt he writeth in Euang. Iac. Hom. 58. He that vseth not the holy scripture, but clymeth another way that is a by way not allowed is a theese.
                  
                     
To this Bristow replyeth, that I will call Chrysostom a theefe by his owne saying, for vsing tradition, yea verely if he be obstinate: and why not as well as S. Paul, or an Angel accursed, if they bring an other Gospel? Secondly he saith, as though he vseth not scripture, which vseth tradition, or that scripture doth not warrant tradition as 2. Thessa. 2. I aunswere such tradition as is warrāted by scripture we refuse not, but if al your traditions were warrāted by scripture, wher should be your vnwritten verities? Thirdly (saith Bristow) the thing yt he speaketh of, is that Antichrist &amp; Pseudochrists, cannot shewe any commission out of scripture. I answere that proueth the Pope to be Antichrist, who neither for his authoritie, nor for his doctrine, can shewe any commission out of the scripture.
                  Fourthly I saide, we may bee as bolde with Chrysostome, as he saide he would be with Paul himselfe, in 2. 
                        
                           ad Tim. Hom. 2. I will say somwhat more, wee must not be ruled by Paul himselfe, if he speake any thing that is his owne, and any thing that is humaine, but wee must obey the Apostle, when he caryeth Christ speaking in him. Bristow asketh, whether he spake onely by scripture. No verily, but by reuelation he spake to S. Paul, by aud
                        •
                     ble and humaine voyce hee spake to the rest of the Apostles, and whatsoeuer hee spake any way pertaining to our instruction, is committed to writing, and therefore I beleeue not Chrysostom, alledging a tradition of the Apostles which is not founde in their writings.
                  Another place of Chrysostom, I cite in Luke, Chap. 16 saying that ignorance of the scriptures hath bredde heresies: Therefore hee woulde haue heresies kept away by knowledge of the scriptures. We would the same (saith Bristowe) but what maketh this for onely scripture to be of authoritie? yes forsooth. If all heresies come through ignorance of the scriptures, that which commeth not through ignorance of the scriptures, is no heresie: And that opinion which is not contained in the scriptures, commeth not of ignorance of the scriptures: therefore he yt knoweth ye scriptures, knoweth all truth.
                  
                     
Vnto Leo the great alledging custome and tradition, I oppose his owne saying, for onely Scripture to be sufficient. Ep. 10. They fall into this follie, which, when they be hindred by some obscuritie, to know the truth, haue not recourse to the wordes of the Prophets, nor to the writinges of the Apostles, nor to the authorities of the Gospell, but to themselues.
                  He doth not say (saith Bristowe) that all truethes are expressed in the Scripture. For he blameth the heretike, for not hauing recourse to our common Creede, as though there were any thing in our common Creede, which is not expressed in the Scripture. And if onely Scripture were not sufficient for men to know the truth in any obscuritie, howe could they be blamed for not hauing recourse vnto them, for yt which they cannot find in them? The words of ye councel of Constantinople ye 6. Act. 18. of Bristows true translation are these: If all men had simply, and without calliditie from the beginning receiued the Gospels preaching, and bene content with the Apostles institutions, the matters verily had beene well a fine, and neither the authors of heresies, nor the fautors of the Priestes, had bene put to the paynes of conflictes: but because the diuell not resting, rayseth vp his squires, therefore Christe also in time conuenient hath raised vp his warriours against them, to wit, the general councels, which to this time haue bene holden being sixe in number. So expressely (saith Bristowe) they auouch the authoritie of councels, and you alledge them for only Scriptures. I crie you mercie sir: Doe they alledge the authoritie of Councels, as though the preaching of the Gospell, and the institutions of the Apostles in their writings were not sufficient: when they saide before, if men would haue bene content with them, there needed no councels? But you adde, that in their wordes, there is no mention at all of Scripture, but onely of preaching and teaching. What I pray you, is the Gospel, which they should preach no scripture? are not the constitutions of the Apostles conteined in their writinges? I know you will answer they are not all contained

in their writinges. At leastwise what sworde did these warriers vse against Satan, styrring vpp his squires? doth not the councell say expresly the sworde of the spirit, which is the worde of God contained in the Scriptures? for what other worde doth Saint Paule commend to the Eph. 6. but the holy Scripture which is profitable to reproue all heresies into perfection? 2. Tim. 3.
                  Against Basil maintaining vnwritten tradition I opposed his owne auctority, De Ver. Fid. in Proem. Morall. We knowe yt we must now and alwaies auoyde euery worde and opinion that is differing from the doctrine of our Lorde. But all is not differing, saith Bristowe, that is not expressed in the Scripture. Neither doe I say so, but all is differing that can not be proued by Scripture. And so saith Basil in his short definition, to the first interrogation. Whether it be lawfull or profitable for a man, to doe or saie any thing which he thinketh to be good, without testimony of the holy Scriptures: He answereth: For as much as our sauiour Christ saith, that the holy Ghost shall not speake of himselfe, what madnes is it that any man should beleeue any thing without the auctority of Gods worde? Here you see, he extendeth the worde of God no farther then the holy Scriptures. Yet Bristowe saith: If I sawe the place, my malice passeth. For the wordes are these. Who can be so madde, that he dare so much as to thinke any thing of him selfe? And it followeth. But because of those things &amp; words that are in vse amongest vs, some are plainly taught in the holy Scripture some are omitted. Concerning them that are omitted (saith Bristowe) We haue this rule, to be subiect to other men for Gods commandement renouncing quite our owne wills. In very deede I abridged the place, and gaue the true sense, because it is large. But if Bristowe vnderstand Basills language, his wordes are these: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , &amp;c, Seeing our Lorde Iesus Christ saith of the holy Ghost, for he shall not speake of himselfe, but what things so euer he shall heare, the same shall he speake: and of him

selfe: the sonne can doe nothing of himselfe. And againe, I haue not spoken of my selfe, but the father which hath sent me, he himselfe hath giuen me a commandement what I shall saie and speake. And I knowe that his commandement is life eternall. Therefore the things which I speake, euen as the father hath said vnto me, so I speake. Who is come into so greate madnes, yt he dare of him selfe take vpon him any thing 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         euen vnto knowledge? which hath neede of the holy and good spirite as a guide that he may de directed into the waie of truth, both in minde and speache, and deede, but walketh blinde and in darknes without the sonne of righteousnes, yea our Lorde Iesus Christ, him which giueth light with his commandements as it were with beames? For the commandement of the Lorde saith he is bright, lightning the eies. Seeing then that of such things as we haue in vse, some are vnder the com mandement of God prescribed in the holy Scripture, &amp; some are not spoken of concerning those that are written, no liberty at all is giuen to any man, neither to do any thing of those that are forbidden, nor to omit ought of those things which are prescribed. Seeing the Lorde hath once charged and saide: thou shalt keepe the worde which I command thee this daie: thou shalt not adde vnto it, neither shalt thou take from it. For there is a terrible expectation of iudgment and zeale of fyer, which shall deuoure all those which shalbe bolde to do any such thing. And concerning those things, which are not spoken of, the Apostle Paule hath set vs a rule saying: all things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawfull for me, but all things do not edify, Let no man seek his own profit but euery one an other mans. So that in euery matter, it is necessary to be subiect to God, according to his commandement. For it is written, be ye subiect one to an other in the feare of Christ.
                  
                  
                     And our Lord saith, he that will among you be great, let him be least of all, and seruant of all, that is to say, estraunged from his owne will, according to the

imitation of our Lorde himselfe, which saith: I came downe from heauen, not that I should doe mine owne will, but the will of my father which hath sent me, Where hath Bristowe, that we should be subiect to other men in such thinges, as are omitted by Scripture; therefore not my malice, but his ignorance passeth, and that willful also, although he follow the old barbarous translation of Basil when he may haue a better. An other place of Basil I cited in his Moral. defin. 26. Euery word or deed must be confirmed by the testimony of holy Scripture for the persuasion of good men, &amp; the confusion of wicked men. Bristow saith, he admonisheth his monkes being students in diuinity, to be so perfect in the Scriptures, yt they may haue a text redy, at euery need as when we bidde them, cast all away that is not written, they haue this text ready, where Saint Paule biddeth vs the contrary. To holde the traditions which we haue learned, whether it be by his Scripture, or by his worde of mouth. 2. Thess. 2. And doth Paule bidde them holde such doctrine as was not to be proued out of the Scriptures? did hee preach any such doctrine among the Thessalonians, when those to whom he preached daily, searched the Scriptures, tosee if those thinges were euen so. Act. 17. And where I pray you, did you heare any tradition by worde of Saint Paules mouth, that you may obiect it to vs? we doubt not but whatsoeuer he preached was as true, as that he did put in writing, if you can assure vs of it: but seeing that is impossible, and it is certaine he preached no doctrine but such as he committed to writing, Basills rule must still stande in force, that euery worde and deede must haue confirmation of holy scripture, or else it is not good, for all good workes are taught in the Scripture, and all true doctrine may be found in them. 1. Tim. 3.
                  Now commeth Bristowe, to answere such things as I obiect out of Augustine against vnwritten traditions: which he digesteth into three sorts. The first are quotations of 11. or 12. places in which he preferreth the autority of the canonicall Scripture, before all writinges

of Catholike Doctours of Bishops, of Councels, before all customes and traditions.
                  But this Bristow denieth to be the question, but whether nothing but Scripture be of authoritie: I aunswere, those places proue that nothing is of infallible veritie, but the scriptures, therfore they proue that they only are of irrefragable authoritie.
                  The second sorte of places are about this question, who hath the true Church. Of which question I affirme, that S. Augustine would haue the Church sought only in the Scriptures. And he
                        •
                     e he biddeth me reade his first demande, likewise I wil send him to mine answer vnto ye same. At length he confesseth, that Augustine is content in that question, to set aside all other authorities, to trie it by the Scriptures: But that nothing els is good authoritie in that question, that he neuer sayeth. Neither doe we say it, or refuse any authoritie, that is agreeable to the Scriptures. And as that one question, which was betweene S. Augustine, and the Donatistes was determinable by the onely authorititie of Scriptures, so are all questions that are betweene the Church of all times, and all heretikes.
                  The Donatistes helde that the Church was perished out of all partes of the world, except Affrica, as the Papistes holde, that it is perished out of all partes except a peece of Europa. Saint Augustine by the Scripture proueth, the continuance in the Churche dispersed ouer all the worlde, and that we holde against the Romishe synagogue of Popish Donatistes, who haue separated them selues from the Catholike Church, into the function of an Italian Priest, as the other did of an Affrican. But Bristowe sayeth, I am as blinde as a beetle, in saying that the Papistes did separate themselues from our Church, seeing it is certain, that Luther did separate him selfe from the Popish Church. The like might be said to all them that forsoke the fellowship of any heretikes, to come vnto the Churche of God.
                  But Bristow is as madde as a marche Hare, that bragging so much of the title of ye church, he is driuen to trie it only by the Scriptures, as Augustine calleth vpon the

Donatists. The other places which I aledge out of Aug, (saith Bristowe) are about al questions with heretikes, whatsoeuer. As that he would oppresse the Arrian Maximinus with the authoritie of the Nicene councel. Lib. 3. Cap. 14. Bristowe asketh, whether he might not presse them with the authoritie thereof, as he doth the Donatistes? But aske Augustine him selfe who saith, he ought not in that case, that he charged the Donatistes, which it was by their own concession, because they allowed it. But he saith in the same place, the Fathers of the Nicene councell ratified Homousion, that is, equalitie of the sonne with the father, Veritatis autoritate, &amp; autoritatis veritate, by authoritie of trueth, and by trueth of authoritie. This truth of authoritie, Bristowe will haue to be the authoritie of the Nicene councell, as though the councel could not erre: but then what needed ye authoritie of trueth? In deede where the councel decreeth with the trueth, it is the trueth of authoritie, for other authoritie a Councell hath not, but of trueth: to declare trueth, and not to make trueth, for if it declare errour, as the councell of Arimine did, it hath no trueth of authoritie, because it hath no authoritie of trueth. Moreouer Bristow saith, I translate falsely these wordes, Nec ego huius autoritate, nec tuillius detineris. Neither am I bounden to the authoritie of the one, nor thou of the other. Whereas it should be: Neither doth the authoritie of the one hold me, nor of the other holde thee. There is greate difference betweene, beeing holden, and beeing bound. To the bare authoritie of the councell of Nice, Maximinus was no more bounden, then Augustine to the bare authoritie of Ariminum. It was the trueth of Nice, that the Arrian was bounde vnto, and the falshod of Ariminum, that Augustine was not holden with vs. But after the example of Augustine (saith Bristowe) we will not alledge the councell of Trent, as our proper witnesses to our side, but the authoritie of Scriptures common to both. Witnesse hereof, Bristowes motiues, where he would ouerthrowe vs by the bare name of Catholike, and heretike, &amp;c. Againe

he saith, that we make challenge of 600. yeares also. And what then? Witnesses of trueth we take wheresoeuer they be, but authoritie of trueth onely out of the Scriptures. Where I said, that Augustine, setting all other persuasions aside, prouoketh onely to the Scriptures, to trie the faith and doctrine of the Churche: Bristowe answereth: Howe true that is, appeareth in the same booke, De Vnitate Eccle. which you cite. For when he hath proued against the Donatistes, the Church to be his, he saith expressely, that to be inough also, for all other questions. Sufficit nobis: It is inough for vs that we haue that Church, which is pointed too, by most manifest testimonies of the holy and Canonicall Scriptures. De Vnit Eccle. Cap. 19. Doth he say expressely, it is inough for all other questions? I must needes say expressely you lie. For the onely question, being how the Donatistes should be receiued, if they would come to the Catholike Church, as though they were the true Church, because baptisme giuen among them was not repeated in the Catholike Church, Augustine after much concertation saith. 
                        Quapropter cum dicatur haereticis, &amp;c. Wherfore seeing it is said to the heretiks: Rightousnes is wanting to you, which without charitie, and the bonde of peace, no man can haue, &amp; seeing they thēselues confesse, that many haue baptisme, which haue not righteousnesse, and if they would not confesse it, the holy Scripture conuinceth them, I maruell howe they thinke, when we wil not baptise them again, hauing not their own, but the baptisme of Christ, that we do so, as though we iudged nothing to be now wanting to thē &amp; that because baptisme is not giuen to them in the Catholike Church, which they are founde to haue already, they thinke they receiue nothing there, where they receiue yt without which, yt which they haue, auaileth them to their destruction, and not to their saluation. Which if they wil not vnderstand, it is sufficient for vs, yt we holde yt Church, which is shewed forth by most manifest testimonies of the holy and canonical Scriptures. Where he speaketh not of the authortie of ye Church to determine questions, but sheweth it is sufficiēt to haue proued by ye
                     
Scriptures, that they are the true Church, although the Heretikes will not vnderstand how baptisme being ministred out of the Church, hath not effect, but in the true Church, for if it be manifest by the Scriptures that Augustine holdeth the true Church, that last question of theirs, how they should be receiued, though it be not resolued, yet can not disprooue them to be the true Church, nor proue the Donatists to be the Church, seeing there can be but one.
                  Where out of this Booke Cap. 16. I shewe, that Augustine declareth, first that Heretikes must be confuted only by Scriptures, secondly that neither councells, succession of Bishoppes vniuersality, miracles, visions, dreames nor reuelations, are the notes to trie the Catholike Church, but only the Scriptures: Bristowe saith, they are notes with the Scripture, as he hath shewed in his demaund, I answere whatsoeuer agreeth wt the Scripture, may well be receiued. But the Scripture without all these is sufficient, to trie the Church as Augustine sheweth, &amp; therefore all the rest of Bristowes motiues, might be spared, if he durst ioyne issue vpon the Scripture only, as Augustine doth, but that he dare not do. He hath a great quarrell of Augustine, for translating manifestatur is proued, as though Augustine saide, that true miracles and visions lacke waight and fashion of iust probation. If you call true miracles, that are done indeede and not counterfeited, I say that all such make no iust probation. For God tempteth his Church by such, to see if they will forsake his commandement. Deut. 13. But those that be true miracles indeede, are ioyned with the truth of doctrine, which being tryed by the worde of God to be such, confirme it or prepare mens mindes vnto it, of themselues neuer sufficient to auouch true doctrine, without Gods worde: and therefore I will stil t
                        ••
                     nslate, manifestatur is manifestly prooued or shewed, which is alone.
                  Moreouer out of Augustine Cont. Epist. sundam. Cap. 4. I shewed, that though consent, and vniuersality, antiquity, succession, be good confirmation, when they are

ioyned with truth: yet when trueth is seuered from them, it is more to be regarded then they all. Bristowe saith, that Augustine graunteth not that the truth can be separated from them. Yes verily, or else he should haue stood vpon that poynt only, that truth can not be seuered from those markes, which vndoubtedly the Catholique Church had, and the Manichees wanted. And although he saide, the Church had most syncere wisdom, yet he saith not, that wheresoeuer was antiquity, succession, &amp;c. there must needs be the most syncere wisdome.
                  Lastly out of the booke De Pastoribus Cap. 14. I affirmed, that mans auctority is too weake to carry away so waighty a matter, as was in question, vsing the wordes of Augustine: Auferantur chartae humanae, &amp;c. Let mens papers be remoued, let the voices of God be heard, shewe me one place of Scripture for Donatus side, &amp;c. Bristowe rehearsing the saying more at large as I did, Ar. 14. asketh what maketh all this for Fulke? vnlesse hee thinketh he hath any vantage in his owne false translation of Acta, turning it decrees. Surely whether the worde be well or ill translated, I seeke no vantage therof, and yet if I should change my translations, I would rather call Acta actes of the Court or recordes, then Courtrolles as you doe. But euery man may see, what vantage you clasp at, among ignorant persons, by your false translation of Chartae humanae mens Court papers, as though the worde of Augustine were not generall to remoue all mens writings, and to vrge only the Scripture. But the Church beginning at Hierusalem &amp; spreading ouer all Nations, to the very last time, which Augustine in all places proueth against the Donatists, maketh much against vs in Bristowes opinion. Nay rather against the Papists, which restraine the Church into the Romishe rable, which we affirme, both is and was alwaies, scattered ouer al the world, although greater in number at some times then at other some, seeing that Mahomet hath infected a greate part of the worlde, and yet among the Mahometists we doubt not but Christ

hath his members, that neuer bowed their knee either to Mahomet of Mecha, or to the Pope of Rome.
               
               
                  3 About certaine traditions. Bristowe.
                  
                  The oblations Pro natalitiis spoken of before Cap. 6. Par. 1. 5. I saide those oblations, with other superstitions Fulke. fathered vpon tradition of the Apostles, by the Nicen, &amp; other councels, as Rhenanus witnesseth, are abrogated.
                  Bristowe answereth that he speaketh neuer a worde of any other traditions. Yet Bristowe confesseth him selfe, that many of them are abrogated. Cap. 6. Par. 1. 4. &amp; 5.
               
               
                  4 About the marriage of Votaries. Bristowe
                  
                  The two places one of Epiphanius, the other of Hieronyme, whiche I cited for the Marriage of Votaries, Fulke. Bristo we sayeth are about a matter, which they holde euen as those fathers did. But in deede they holde the contrary, for they helde the marriage of such lawfull, the Papistes dissolue them, and say they are no marriages. It is better saith Epiphanius, to haue one sinne, and not many. It is better for him that is fallen from his course, opēnly to take a wife according to the lawe, and of long time to repent from his virginitie, and so to be brought againe to the Church, as one that hath done amisse, as one that is fallen and broken &amp; hauing neede to be bounde, rather then to be wounded daily with priuie dartes, of that wickednesse, which the deuil putteth into him. So knoweth the Church to preache, these are the medicines of healing. Bristowe saith, I gather that marriage is an wholsome medicine for such men. Contrarie to that I confesse my selfe, that he calleth it a sinne.
                  But he slaundereth me as he doeth often: I saide Epiphanius doth count it an offence to marry, because it was

a breache of vowe, but neither he, nor I, saide that mar
                     
                        •
                     i
                        •
                     ge is a sinne Bristowe saith likewise, the Apostles tradition calleth it a sinne. But he slandereth the tradition or Epiphanius the reporter thereof euen as he did me. The words are Hae. 61. Tradiderunt, &amp;c. The holy Apostles of God haue deliuered, yt it is a sin after virginity decreed, to be turned to marriage. They say not marriage is a sinne, but by breache of vowe to marrie is a sinne. For their sinn cannot pollute the ordinance of God. But the wholsome medicines are penance &amp; reconciliation, saith Bristowe. And why not marriage I pray you? whatsoeuer is good for the diseased, is an wholsom medicine: to take a wife openly, is good for the diseased: therefore marriage also is a wholesome medicine. As for your distinction of solemne vowe, and sole vow is a very bable: Epiphanius speaketh generally of al that had vowed virginity.
                  To the place of Hierome Ad Demetriadem, he answereth that they which of two sinnes will needes committ one, they counsell them to committ the lesse rather then the greater. But Hierom maketh no comparison of sinnes, but saith to such virgins as liued incontinently. It must be plainly saide to them, that either they should marry if they cannot containe, or else they should containe if they will not marry.

                  About these pointes I will not stande, considering I Fulke. haue written so much already in confutation of Heskins and Sanders, and that Bristowe bringeth nothing nor halfe so much as hath bene refelled in their books concerning these places.
                  Where I saide, it was not the beleefe of S. Aug. yt the sacrament is the natural body and blood of Christ. Bristow asketh if it be his mystical body, or whether Christ haue any more bodies. It were an easy matter to shewe

that it is called by Augustine the mysticall body of Christ, which is his Church, but I pardon Bristowes ignorance: and answere him, that the sacrament is neither his naturall, nor his mysticall body in proper speeche, But secundum quendam modum, as Aug. saith, after a certain manner, both, And I read in Theodoret of a third body, which the sacrament is, De typico symbolico

                  The place of Augustine, which I translated worde for worde, and faithfully gaue the sense thereof, as euerie man may see that readeth it, Purg. 309. Bristowe shamefully peruerteth, setting the carte before the horse, in rehearsing of it to make a contrary sense. But euen in that same booke and Chapter De Trinitate, Lib. 3. Cap. 10. Augustine is cleare, against that monstrous opinion of transubstantiation, speaking of signes, &amp; namely of the bread which is spent in receiuing of the sacrament: Sed 
                     
                        quia haec, &amp;c. But because these thinges are knowen to men, because they are done by men, they may haue honour, as religious things, but wonder as miracles, they cannot haue. Whereof if he had known the carnal presence, &amp; change of the bread, such as the papistes speake of, he must needes haue acknowledged many wonders and miracles contrary to the order of nature, which they are constrained to faine, although no man can see them, wheras al corporal miracles wroght by God are sensible

                  6 About the sacrament of penance. Absolution. Bristowe
                  
                  About the sacrament of penance, the Popish Church Fulke. saith foure thinges: first that by the Priestes absolution, the guilt of sinne and eternall paines due for it are taken away, but one houres torment in Purgatorie, as the master of the sentences teacheth, is not taken away therby, and Allen confesseth (Bristowe saith) it auaileth to take away the torments of hell. But Allen Purg. 167. requiring submission to Gods ministers for absolution, giueth them in most ample manner a commission of executing Christes office in earth, both for pardoning and punishing of sinne: that suffering here in his Church sentence and iust iudgement for his offences, he may the rather escape our fathers greeuous chastisement in the life to come. Thus Allen is cleane contrarie to Bristowe, and himselfe, and left naked in this place, as almost in all places, by Bristowe, who would seeme to take vpon him his defence.
                  The second thing is temporall debt, remaining after absolution. Touching this matter, I said Purg. 42. That Augustine saith of the deathes of Moses and Aaron, that they were signes of things to come, not punishments of Gods displeasure. Quaest. in Num. lib. 4. cap. 53. Here Bristowe complayneth of my synceritie, and rehearseth the wordes before. When it is said to them, that they should be gathered to their people: It is manifest, that they be not in the wrath of God, which separateth from ye peace of the holy eternall societie. Thereby it is manifest, that also their deathes were signes of thinges to come, &amp; not punishments of Gods indignation. What want of synceritie is here, except there be so great difference betweene indignation and displeasure? But Bristowe cauilleth of the wrath that separateth for euer, as though they were in a wrath that separateth for a time. Yet the scripture presseth, where God saide you shall die, because you did not beleeue me. This was no satisfaction for their temporall debt remaining after absolution, wherof the question is,

but a fatherly correction to them, and an example vnto other. Yea such a correction as was a greater benefite, namely to be receiued into the eternall land of promise, then the punishment was, that they should not enter into the earthly possession.
                  Likewise I reported, that Augustine Cont. Faust. Lib. 22. Cap. 67. and De Pecc. mer. ac rem. Lib. 2. Cap. 23. saith that the punishment laide vpon Dauid after 
                        •
                     his adultery remitted, was the chastisment of Gods fatherly scourge. Bristowe asketh, if it be no punishment, because it is a scourge? yes verily: and whether it be not for sinne? yes truly. But neuer the sooner a temporall debt remaining after absolution, when it is the scourge of a fathers chastisement. For I chastice not my childe, that his punishment should satisfie any part of his fault, but to keepe him in humility, and feare for committing the like, and for example to the rest of my family, as wise a father and diuine as Bristowe will esteme me. And how can Bristowe defend Augustine against the Pelagians, shewing why death that came in by sinne, stil remaineth euen vpon them whose original sinnes he confesseth to be so fully forgiuen in baptisme, yt they owe nothing, neither eternally nor temporally for them: if death in such, be any temporall debt, remaining after absolution, when he will haue the fatherly scourge of God to be a punishment to satisfie the debt of sinne.
                  But for a contradictorie of Allens assertion, I cited out of Chrysostome in Rom. Ho. 8. where there is forgiuenesse, there is no punishment. Bristow saith, he speaketh of the forgiuenesse in baptisme to a Iewe: Allen of forgiuenesse in penance. But he may not creepe out at that hole, it is too straight for him. Chrysostome speaketh generally, wheresoeuer there is forgiuenesse, there is no punishment, yea he saith, Vbi gratia ibi &amp; venia, where grace is, there is forgiuenesse therefore if there be grace in penance there is forgiuenesse, and where there is forgiuenesse, there shalbe no punishment: neither doth Chrysostome in that place speake a word, either of Iewe, or Baptisme, but of all Christians escaping by grace, the

wrath which the lawe worketh, and beeing made heires of the promise by faith.
                  The third thing is satisfaction, against which, Bristow saith, I alledged Chrysostome, and Ambrose so fondly, that the wordes which I alledge will declare, Chrysost. De 
                     
                        
                           Compunct. Cord. lib. 1. Non requirit, &amp;c. God requireth not the burthen of shirts of haire, nor to be shutte vp in the streightes of a little cell, neither doth he commaunde vs to sitte in obscure and darke caues: This onely is that which is required of vs, that we alwayes remember our sinnes. He requireth onely compunction of the heart, therefore he requireth no workes of satisfaction, neither those, nor any other. Bristow will see nothing, but the streight mourning of Monkes. The worde onely is so litle for his purpose, that he cannot see it. And when he hath praised this mourning as much as he can, Chrysostome saith it is besides Gods commandement.
                  To the place of Ambrose in Luc. 22. lib. 10. He saith of Peter. I read of his teares, I reade not of his satisfaction. Bristowe replyeth, that he saith immediatly before, I finde not what he said, I finde that he wept. Wherevpon he will gather, both confession, and satisfaction necessarie. I would faine see that collection in a syllogisme.
                  Surely if they were both necessarie, S. Peter, by iudgement of Ambrose, lacked two necessarie pointes of repentance, which Iudas had, and yet obteyned not forgiuenesse: But teares (saith he) are a speciall kinde of confession and satisfaction. And yet where Ambrose sayeth, they obteine pardon, Bristowe saith, they are not sufficient: so that Peter weeping, hauing beside his inward contrition a speciall kinde of confession and satisfaction, had not yt which wold serue. But Br. leauing this place as obscure, referreth vs to a plain place. Ad vir. Lap. c. 8. For a passing great crime, is necessary a passing great satisfactiō. wherto I answered before, yt an heinous offēce must be earnestly bewailed, if the repentāce be not coū
                     terfet, Brist. saith, He doubted not of her repentance to be vnfeined. What thē? He exhorteth her to continue her repentance, not for satisfaction to God, whose iustice cānot be

sa
                        •
                     isfied by mans worke, but by her earnest sorrowe, to satisfie the Church which was offended by her whoredome.
                  The fourth thing is pardons, whereof Bristowe speaketh as he doth commonly, with wonderfull confusion. I saide the olde satisfaction was in respect of the offence vnto the Church, and not to satisfie the iustice of God, which is not satisfied but by the death of Christ. The penance enioyned by the Church, vpon good consideration, might be and often was released by the Church, as appeareth by many places of Cyprian, which Bristowe citeth and many other, but not by the Bishop only, and this release or remission, was called indulgence or pardon, which is no more like to Popish pardons, then the creaking of a goose, is like the songe of a swanne. But as for pardoning of sinne, they affirmed that it was proper to God, as Ambrose to the virgine. Sticke to penance euen to the end of thy life, and presume not that pardon may be giuen thee of mans day, for he deceiueth thee that so promiseth the. For thou yt hast in speciall sinned against the Lorde, it is meete that of him only thou looke for remedy in the day of iudgement. Bristowe saith, He did binde her to penance all her life, bidding her not to hope for any pardon at his hand, as he bounde the Emperour Theodosius indefinitely, and loosed him after eight moneths penance, with a pardon. Who seeth not, quoth Bristow, that all this maketh plainly for pardons?
                  
                  But Ambrose telleth her, not, that he would not pardon her, but that no man can pardon the offence committed against God, and that if the Pope himselfe should promise to pardon her, he should but deceiue her. And yet the Church might pardon the offence and slander where with they were iustly offended, by her whoredome, and restore her to the Communion, as I doubt not but they did; although she should continue her repentance, al the daies of her life, &amp; when Ambrose did binde and loose the Emperor, he did only vse the discipline of the Church, to bring him to repentance, that God might forgiue his sinnes, not that he might

make satisfaction for ye slaughter of 7000. men, of whom the greatest part were innocents by 8. moneths penance, but after such time, seeing him to be sorrowfull in deede, receiued him againe into the communion. The place of Cyprian In Sermon. de Lapsis is very cleare to shewe that God and not man, forgiueth the sinnes. Let no man deceiue himselfe, let no man beguile himselfe, only our Lord can giue mercy, only he can graunt pardon to sinnes, as beeing committed against him, who hath borne our sinnes, who hath suffered sorrow for vs, whom God hath deliuered for our sinnes. Man cannot be greater then God, neither can the seruant by his indulgence remitt or 
                           •
                        orgiue that which by so greate offence, is committed against the Lorde, least this offence also be added to him, that is fallen, if he knowe not that it is foreshewed, Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man. Our Lorde must be entreated, our Lorde must be pacified, with our satisfaction, which saith, he doth denie that man that denieth him.
                  
                  Against this so plaine a place: Bristowe cauelleth, that he speaketh to impenitents, that trusted also in laie mens pardons: which is false, for they were not altogether impenitent, but not sufficiently repentant, neither did they trust in laie mens pardons, but without dewe repentance tried, made hast to be reconciled by entreaty of the Martyrs, yet with the hurtfull facility of the priests, whereof Cyprian complaineth:  
                        Sic oportet Dei Sacerdotem: So it behoueth the priest of God not to deceiue with the deceiuable ye
                           •
                        lding, but to prouide with wholesome remedies. As for the pardons whose antiquity Bristowe would haue to be noted, were not pardons of sinnes, but release of time of separation enioined by the Church to shewe repentance for their sinnes, as I declared before. Which is euen as auncient as the Gospell, whereas popish pardons Apoena &amp; culpa, are of a much newer stampe, and contrary to the auncient custome in the giuers, for they were geuen by the whole Church, in the persons, for they were giuen to men a liue only, in the time, for they were giuen but

of a short time of penance enioyned in this life, and not of so many thousand yeares, &amp;c. in the thing released, for they were neither pardons of punishment, nor of sinne dewe to Gods iustice, but of time of satisfaction to be made to the Church, when the Church was otherwise satisfied.

                  Bristowe chargeth me to vse the arguments from Fulke. mens authoritie negatiuely, which I my selfe confesse to be naught, but he mistaketh the matter: I saide the order of prayers and administration of the holie mysteries, described by Iustinus, and Tertullian, doe sufficiently declare what was the vsage of the Christians in those purer times, in which no mention beeing made of oblations and sacrifice for the deade, it is certaine, there was none vsed, not onely because there is no mention, but because those two olde Fathers in their Apologies, declare whatsoeuer was done in their assemblies. As for oblations for the dead, that Tertullian speaketh of, cannot be proued to haue beene vsed at the communion, but rather at the buriall of the dead. But Arnobius (saith Bristow) about the very same time, as a witnes to the contrarie, complayning that the connenticle houses of the Christians, were pulled downe by the Paganes, in which God is prayed vnto, peace, &amp; pardon is asked, for al men, for the Magistrates, for friends, for enemies, for the liuing and for the dead. Such a saying there is in Arnobius, Lib. 4. Con. gra. I confesse, but how proueth Bristowe, that he was about the time of Iustinus, or Tertullian, when he confesseth it was 300, yeares since Christians were named, Lib. 1? and vnder Dioclesian he florished, saieth Hierome, which was sixe or seuen score yeres after Tertullian, the later of the two who florished vnder Seuerus.
                  The olde liturgie of the Greeke Church in Epiphanius time, had a memorie of the dead, but seeing it was

an oblation for the Patriarches, Prophetes, Apostles, &amp;c. in the first institution thereof, it could be but an offering of thankes giuing, although Epiphanius expounded it after the errour of this time, to be a prayer for the sinner, &amp; a separation of Christ from the order of men. This is the effect of that I saide. Bristowe saith, I am deceiued, by thinking it is but one memorie, whereof Epiphanius speaketh, and sendeth me to the countefeit liturgies of Saint Iames, Chrysostome, and Basil, which were written long after their age, according as well to ye error of the time, in which they were writtē, as in some expressing the name of the Emperour, and Bishop, in whose time they were written. Also he sendeth me to diuers places of S. Augustine, but which I knowe not, for the place Encherid C. 110. &amp; Dulci. q. 4. are of one sacrifice offered for all baptized persons that are departed, which he saith for the very good are thankesgiuing, for them that were not very ill asking of mercie, for the verie ill no helpe, but a comfort of the liuing. Chrysostome also speaketh of a generall memorie of all that were departed, instituted by ye Apostles Ad Philip. hom. 3. in which if there had bene an expresse forme of prayer for ye dead, he needed not of that memorie, to haue proued prayer to be profitable to the dead. The place of Origen he mangleth, euen as his Maister Allen doth, but he more vsually, suffering no sentence of any writer almost to be read together, without preiudice of his interlacing. In 
                     
                        
                           Iob lib 3. The former men did celebrate the day of their birth, louing but one life, and not hoping for any other after this. But now doe we not celebrate the day of natiuitie, seeing it is the entrance of sorowes &amp; tēptations, but we celebrate ye day of death, as yt which is ye putting away of al sorowes, &amp; the escaping of al tēptations. We celebrate ye day of death, because they doe not die that seeme to die. Therfore also do we make memories of ye Saints, &amp; deuoutly kepe the memories of our parents or friends, dying in the faith, as much reioycing in their rest, as desiring also for our selues a godly finishing in faith. So therfore we do not celebrate ye day of natiuitie,

because they which die shall liue perpetually. And thus we celebrate it, calling together the deuoute men with the Priestes, the faithfull with the Cleargie, inuiting also the needie and poore, filling the fatherlesse and widowes with foode, that our festiuitie may be done in remembrance of the rest, which is vnto the soules departed, whose memorie we celebrate, and may be made of vs a sauour of sweetenesse in the sight of the eternal God. First concerning my translation, Bristowe will haue Religiosos to signifie Monkes, as though none were deuout, but they, or as though the Church in Origens time, were so full of Monkes, as it was afterward. Secondly he saith, that death is a putting away of the sorowes of this life only, where Origen saith of all, and it were small cause of reioysing, to put off the small sorrowes of this life, if men should enter the horrible torments of Purgatorie. Againe, the rest of the dead, he will haue to be onely of their bodies. That were a poore refrigerium, if their soules should frie in Purgatorie. The sauour of sweetenesse he wil not haue to be a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, but a worke meritorious, as though it was a worke meritorious, that Noe offered cleane beastes after the floode, when the text saith, the Lorde smelled a sweete sauour, Gen. 8. and not rather a sacrifice of thankesgiuing for his deliueraunce. The like ignorance (he saith) I shewe, to thinke that memorie for one, cannot be a prayer for him. As S. Paule to the Colloss. Remember my giues: and to the Hebrues, Remember them that are in giues, &amp;c. But where did I say so ignorantly, that prayer may not be ioyned with remembrance? For I trust Bristow is not so brutish, to say that all memorie is a prayer. But how skilfull is he, to compare the memorie of imprisonment, which is an admonition to pray for the imprisoned, with the memorie of rest which beeing obteined, what should we pray for? As for the wordes in S. Iames his Masse, which was written by some Sir Iames, many hundreth yeares after Origens death, I cannot be persuaded that Origen should allude vnto them.
                  
                     
Where Cyprian saith, that Victor deserued not to be named at the altar in the prayer of the priests, I shewed by diuerse good reasons, that he meaneth not of prayer for him, but such as was of thankesgiuing for the dead, and for the like godly departure of the faithfull liuing. For his offence in making a Clarke executor, was not to be punished with eternall torments, wherto Bristow answereth by telling of three things done in their Masse, which he saith were done in Cyprians time, but that is the matter in controuersie. my reasons alledged Pur. 284. he toucheth not at all.
                  I noted Pur. 259. that Allen had falsified 2. Councells at once, the Councell of Carthage the 4, Cap. 95. &amp; the Councell of Vase, which speaking of such executors as defrauded the Church of the oblations of the deade, which they had bequeathed to the vse of the poore: Allen saith to excommunicate them, that hinder the oblations for the deade. Now commeth Bristowe and saith, it is but meere cauelling to distinguish oblations of the deade, &amp; oblations for the deade, because Cyprian saith, there should be no offering for Victor. I haue shewed, Pur. 284. that this offering was but a thankesgiuing, and this discipline was not to cutt him from the Church, but an admonition to other. As for the other Councells of Toledo 11. Bracharense, with this of Carthage and Vase, I haue answered Pur. 426. against which, Bristowe here saith nothing, but repeateth them with his vsuall interlardings.
                  The Councell Bracharense, which I twise promised to shewe forth against Purgatory, when I came to it, Bristow saith, I plainly confesse the contrary, to wit a memory for the deade. I said that for them that kill them selues, that Councell decreed, that no commemoration should be made. Ca. 34. &amp; what this cōmemoration i
                        •
                     , I said it appeareth in ye next Canon, where they cal it the commemoration of the holy oblation, that is, they decreed, that no communion should be celebrated, in which being a commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ, no mention of them that so died should be in

their thankesgiuing, as was vsed for them that died well.
                  Out of the 3. Toletan. Cap 22. I shewed that it was decreed that the bodies of the faithfull should be buried only with singing of psalmes, which must be thought sufficient for all Christians: this I said, excluded both prayers and oblations for the deade.
                  Bristow cauelleth, that although in carrying the corps to the grane, they vsed to singe psalmes, yet they might haue prayer &amp; oblation for their soules in the Church. I answere, the councell thinketh singingof psalmes sufficient for the office of their buriall, therefore prayer and oblation were thought needelesse. But that they had prayer and oblation in Spaine, for the deade, he would proue by a saying of Augustine De cur. pro mor. Cap. 1. where he saith the custome of the vniuersall Church is, that in the prayers of the priest, which are made to God at the altar, the commendation also of the deade hath his place. This commendation might be without prayer, as in the olde liturgie the oblation for all the Patriarkes, Prophets, Apostles &amp;c. or if it were in speciall forme of prayer for the deade in Affrica, it proueth not that it was in Spaine. For Augustine speaketh of the vniuersall Church, no farther then his owne knowledge, or if it were in his time, it might afterward be reformed in Spaine, as diuers other errors were, namely in that Councell of Toledo, and other before it. But Bristowe vrgeth me farther, and saith, I might as well say, the Papists pray not for the deade, because they carry the corps with psalmes. But he will neuer see the litle worde, only, ioyned in the Canon to psalmes, nor the sufficiency of the office for the buriall of all Christians. Againe he demandeth of De profundis, being a psalme, Is it not a prayer for the deade, trowe you? I trowe no. Except all prayers that men make for them selues, be prayers for the deade.
                  As for the buriall of papists, claimed by ministers in England, I thinke you belie them, for they could be

content you had all the obstinate papists in your bosome at Loueine, quicke and deade: But such as die among vs, we are not nice in denying them buriall in the vsuall cemiteries, although we communicate not with them in their life, yet alwaies protesting, that more seuere discipline were meete for them in their life, and to be executed vpon them euen in their death, after the example of Cyprians time although we think worse of them then Cyprian did of Victor.
                  I saide farther, that the place of Possidonius speaking of the funerall of Saint Augustine, proueth that the sacrifice offred for the commending of his bodies deposition, was the sacrifice of thanksgiuing. Here first Bristowe accuseth mine ignorance in antiquity, that I vnderstand deposition for the putting of his body by death, where it is the laying downe of it in the earth, as Leuatio corporis, is the taking vp of Saints bodies or reliques, a worshipfull witnesse of antiquity. For Cyrillus testifieth that they were not in his time taken out of the earth Lib. 10. Cont. Iulian. But marke how skillfully Bristowe expoundeth Possidonius, saying, The sacrifice was offred to God, for the commending of his bodies deposition. That is, saith Bristowe (expositione prima) for the laying downe of it in the earth by burying. Why might not his body be laide in the graue without a propiciatory sacrifice? The second exposition is, that by commending the deposition of his body, which is the laying it downe in the graue, he meaneth, the commendation of his soule to God.
                  With such expositions hee may prooue what hee will out of the Doctors. But to admitt this monstrous interpretation, how agreeth it with popery? or Augustines owne opinion, that seing he was a perfect man &amp; died in persecution, while his City was besieged, &amp; the same day it was taken, that any sacrifice, should be offred for his soule, seeing he himselfe saith, it is iniury to pray for a Martyr, De Verb. Ap. 517? But that prayers for the deade were vsed in Saint Augustines time, and at the celebration of the Lords Supper, it is not of me

denied, and therefore needed not of Bristowe to be proued. But he will make me both answerer and replyer, Because I graunt that S. Augustine prayed for his parent, and yet taunt Allen for translating Memoriam sui, a memorie of her to be a memorie for her, as though she would haue her sonne to be a Chantrie Priest, to sing for her.
                  First I say, that if the Pope himselfe, translate Memoriam sui, a memorie for her, the translation is false. Secondly, where he saith, the sacrifice of our price was offered for her: I shewed that before, that so he called the celebration of the Lordes Supper, vnderstanding it neuerthelesse not to bee the sacrifice it selfe, that beeing once offered, did perfectly redeeme vs, but a memorie and thankesgiuing for the same, as I shewed out of Augustine and other Doctours, Pur. 316. and so forth in the rest vnto the leafe 327.
                  Finally, Bristowe citeth Augustine De Verb. Ap. Hom. 34. This as a tradition of our Fathers, the whole Church doth obserue, that for them which are departed in the communion of Christes bodie and bloud, when at the healthfull sacrifice they are remembred in their place, prayer is made, and it is rehearsed that it is offered for them also: I answere this oblation, being generall for all that are departed in the faith of Christ, can be but a sacrifice of thanksgiuing, considering that the sacrifice of bread and wine, as they called it, in remembrance of the onely and insacrificable sacrifice of Christ, as S. Augustine calleth his propitiatorie sacrifice, coulde be no propitiation, but a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, or prosperitie, or praise. August. Contra Faustum lib. 6. lib. 20. Cap. 18. &amp; 21. Contra aduers. Leg. &amp; Prophet. lib. 1. cap. 6. 7. 19. 20. and many other places through out his workes.
               
               
                  Of particular Doctours. Whether Saint Augustine doubted of Purgatorie. Bristowe.
                  
                  That Saint Augustine allowed prayer for the dead, Bristowe citeth many places but without neede, seeing Fulke.
                     
I con
                        •
                     esse it: but that he neuer doubted of Purgatorie, that is not proued thereby. The Grecians at this day deny Purgatorie, yet do they allowpraier for the dead. Whereas I cited Saint Augustine Encher. Chapter. 69. It is not incredible, that such a thing is done, euen after this life, and whether it be so or no, it may be enquired. And either it may be found out or remaine hid, that some faithfull men by a certaine Purgatorie fire, by how much more or lesse they haue loued perishing goodes, to be saued sooner or later: yet not such of whō it is saide, that they shall not possesse the kingdome of GOD, except the same crimes be remitted to them conueniently repenting.
                  
                  
                     Bristowes answere is, that there are two Purgatorie fires, the one to punish soules for sinne, wherof S. Augustine is certaine: the other not to punish sinne, but onely to weare out by little &amp; little, such affections to worldely lawfull thinges, as to wiue, &amp;c. that without griefe of minde, he cannot parte from them, so as the other which builded Golde, &amp;c. whereof Augustine is vncertaine. Afterwarde he concludeth, they are two operations of one Purgatorie, the one to purge sinne with punishment, the other to purge worldly lawfull affections. If there be but one Purgatorie fire, Augustine doubteth not onely of the punishment, but of the purging fire. But Augustine speaketh not of purging lawfull affections, for what purgation should there neede, where no vnlawful thing is to be purged? But of vnlawfull affections of worldly lawfull thinges, which are loued so farre aboue measure, that they cannot be lost for Christes sake, without greefe: these Cupiditates greedie desires, Augustine calleth the wood, Strawe, and stubble, which is builded vpon the foundation Christ, vpon whome it is sinne to builde any thing, but Golde, Siluer, or pearles, &amp;c. 1. Cor. 3. so that it is sinne that Augustine speaketh of. Whereof he doubteth, whether it is purged by a Purgatorie fire after this life. Againe vtterly excluding impenitent sinners, from hope of this purging fire, it is manifest, that of penitent sinners he maketh this doubt, whether they may be saued by this Purgatory fire, after

their death. Wherfore Bristows distinction is cleane contrary to Augustines meaning. Likewise wher he maketh a doubt whether such worldly lawful affections remain in the soules of the elect, departed, as loue of wife &amp;c. he shamefully slaundereth Saint Augustine, as though he helde any such opinion, when no such thing can be gathered out of his wordes falsifying to his purpose the Doctors wordes, which are Rerum secularium quamuis licitè concessarum tales cupiditates: Such greedy desires of worldly, although things lawfully graunted, to call them such worldly lawfull affections, whereas Augustine saith not, that such affections are lawfull, but that the worldly things are lawfull, on which such affection is sett. Likewise Ad Dulci. quaestion. prima. he bringeth for example, a certaine carnall affection towarde riches, a cogitation of those things which are of this worlde, how a man should please his wife &amp;c to be this wood, haie, &amp;c. and likewise doubtfully concludeth whether therefore in this life only, men suffer these things, or whether certaine such iudgments followe after this life &amp;c. excluding againe murderers, fornicators, lyers periurers, &amp;c. The like doubt he maketh De Ciuit. Dei Lib 21. Ca. 26. saying, that peraduenture it is true that this purging fier is in this lite onely, peraduenture after this life onely, or both in this life and after, but yet for all men to passe through, the perfect without sense, they that are entangled with these veniall sinnes, with sense of paine and losse &amp;c.
                  But Augustine (saith Bristowe) sheweth himselfe certeine of purging paines De Ciuitate Dei Lib. 21. Cap. 24. saying it is certeine that such men are purged before Doomesday by temporall paines &amp;c. As for this place, being not founde in many auncient written coppies as Viues sheweth, seemeth to be a corrupted place added by other, not written by Augustine. The like may be suspected of the place Cap. 13. of the same Booke, where he reporteth what he had said before of remitting sinnes in the worlde to come, which yet is not to be founde in that Booke, as for the places of Enchirid. Cap. 110. and Ad

Dulc.

                     . 2. which he quoteth, haue nothing but of praiers for the dead. Wherfore Augustine although he allowed prayer for the dead, to auaile them remaining in secret receptacles, as he termeth them Enchirid. Cap. 109. yet he was not certeine of Purgatory. Touching inuocation of Saints (which I confessed Augustine to allowe according to the error of his time) and prayers to be profitable for the deade, I said Pur. 317. that Augustine is full of doubts and questions in the matter, and first whether the mothers supplication to the Martyr profited her sonne, Augustine said, that did profite him buried in the holy place, if any thing profited. Whereof I gathered, that he speake
                        •
                     h doubtfully. Bristow crieth out that I am past all shame: for Augustiue neuer doubted whether such supplication might profitte, but whether the mother had any such cogitation. I aunswere, he doubted at least, whether such kinde of supplication did profite or no: for the doubt of her cogitation was expressed before in an other condition, Si quidem credidit, if she beleeue, &amp;c. But to refell my impudencie, as it should seeme, he hath heaped vp a sorte of places, to proue that Saint Augustine clearely affirmed supplication to Saints to profitte the deade: first, Non inaniter fiun
                           •
                        , they be not made in vaine. Cap. 1. But these wordes are not in that Chapiter. He saith there Ne
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         Ecclesia inaniter, Neither the Church nor the frendes care for the deade bestoweth in vain such deuotion as it can: where he speaketh of prayers for the deade, but not of supplication to the Martyrs. Secondly he citeth Prosunt quibusdam mortuis, they profitte one sort of the deade Cap. vlt. but neither are there such wordes, nor for such purpose. Thirdly, Non sunt praetermittende, they must not be omitted, C
                        •
                      4. also, Fiunt recta fide, ac pietate, they be made with right faith, and pietie, Cap. 4. These wordes in deede are there, but of prayers for the deade generally, although there also in the same Chapiter to his purpose which he noteth not: last of all, Religiosus amicus, &amp;c. they be necessary, the deuout frend must in no case omitte them Ca. 5.

the necessarie supplications he speaketh of, are prayers generally, not that prayer to Saintes, are of him called necessarie supplications. But vnto all the other doubtes, which I in the place aboue quoted, had noted out of that treatise of Augustine Bristowe speaketh not a worde.
               
               
                  Whether S. Augustine denied Purgatorie. Bristowe
                  
                  Bristowe rehearseth my wordes (with such fidelitie Fulke. as is vsuall to Papistes) as though I had saide, that Saint Augustine denied Purgatorie by the name of Purgatorie, whereas my wordes are, that he seemeth to deme all other receptacles of the soules departed, beside heauen and hell. But of a third place (saith he,) we are altogether ignorant, neither do we finde it in the holie Scriptures. Hypog, Cont. Pel De Verb. Apost. Ser. 14. Bristowe sayeth, I answere it my selfe, in saying, he writeth against the Pelagians, that imagined a third place for the euerlasting rest of infantes that were not baptized. But what saith Bristowe to my reply? which is this, The same reason serueth as well against the Popish Purgatorie, because we finde it not in the holie Scriptures. Bristowe asketh whether Saint Augustine doth so reason against it? As though that were materiall, when the reason will binde one man as wel as another, and one matter as wel as another. As for his opinion of prayer for the dead, as I haue often saide, proueth not a thirde place: as for the two places De Ciu. Dei. lib. 21. cap. 13. &amp; 24. the one manifestly corrupted, the other iustly suspected, I haue spoken to them both alreadie.
               
               
                  Other Doctors about prayer for the dead. Bristowe.
                  
                  I cited Purg. 382. Gelasius 24. 92. C. Legatur, That no man can be absolued of the Pope after his death: and Fulke. wherefore then serue the Popes Pardons? Bristowe answereth, that all their suffrages are only for them that die in their communion, and not for excommunicate persons. Verie well: yet are you not escaped. For where is the Popes commission for pardoning? Quodeunque, &amp;c
                     
Whatsoeuer thou shalt loose vpon earth, it shalbe loosed in heauen, &amp;c. if this be your commission, as well for giuing pardōs, as for absoluing excommunicate persons, this commission cannot be exercised but vpon the liuing. We read, saith Gel
                           •
                        sius, that Christe did raise the dead: we reade not that he did absolue them that died in errour. (If I had pleasure to enterlarde the Doctors sayinges as you haue, I should adde that we reade not that Christ gaue pardon to any in Purgatorie.) And because he alone had power onely this to doe, he committed it to Peter the Apostle principally, Whatsoeuer thou shalt loose vpon earth, it shabe loosed also in heauen, &amp;c. He saith vpon earth, for he neuer saide, that he was to be absolued which died in his binding. Likewise that this authoritie giuen by this texte, be it more or lesse, is to be exercised onely vpon men liuing on the earth: you may read, 
                        C. 24 q. 2. Quod autem. And that no man can be excommunicated or absolued after his death, it is shewed by the wordes of the Gospell, in which it is said: whatsoeuer you shal binde &amp;c. he saith: vpon the earth, not vnder the earth. Where I cited out of Cyprian Cont. Demetr. Pur. 140. when men are departed from hence, there is no place of repentance, no effect of satisfaction, Here life is either lost or saued, Here prouision is made for euerlasting life, by the worshipping of the fruite of faith: Bristowe chargeth me with clipping, because I left out the last periode, which is neither to nor fro my purpose. Likewise where I said, he exhorteth Demetrianus himselfe to repentance, which had bene a wicked man and a persecutor of Christians, he chargeth me with changing, for I should haue said, which presently was. I changed no worde of Cyprian, in saying, he had beene, and a reasonable man would haue vnderstoode me, that he presently was such a one, when I said Cyprian exhorteth him to repentance. But what is the answere? This which is expresly written of Infidells in hell, and of baptisme, I pretend to be written of the faithfull in Purgatory, and of penance after baptisme. I answere, Cyprian speaketh generally of all

men, &amp; not of Infidels only, &amp; of al men in this world and not of Infidels in hell. 
                        Nec quisquam, &amp;c. Neither let any man be staide: either by sinnes or by yeares that he should not come to obteine saluation. To him that remaineth still in this worlde, no repentance is to late. The way is open vnto pardon: and to them that seeke and vnderstand the trueth, the accesse is easie.
                  
                  Finally after he had saide, that passage is from death to life, the place by me cited, he addeth, 
                        Hanc graiiam, This grace Christ bestoweth, this gift of his mercie he giueth by subduing death with the trophee of his crosse, redeeming the beleeuer with the price of his bloud, reconciling man to God his father, quickening a mortall man by heauenly regeneration. Him, if it may be, let vs all followe, let vs be esteemed by his sacrament and signe, he openeth vnto vs the way of life, he restoreth vs to Paradise, he bringeth vs to the kingdome heauen: with him we shall alwayes liue, &amp;c. These wordes declare that Cyprian acknowledgeth one meane of saluation, as well for the Gentile to be baptised, as for the penitent Christian by the onely mercie of God in Christe obteined in this life, without any satisfaction of paine, for euer after this life: and therefore he saith moreouer, That beeing made the sonnes of God by Christ, restored by his bloud, we shall alwayes reioyce with him. We Christians shall be together with Christ glorious, blessed of God our father, reioycing of perpetuall pleasure, alwayes in the sight of God, and alwayes giuing thankes to God. For he can not be but alwayes ioyfull and glad, which when he was guilrie of death, is made sure of immortality. Thus doth Cyprian promise to Demetrianus, if he did repent, but euen immediately before his death, and were baptised, that he should enioye the same state of felicitie, with all faithfull Christians, in perpetuall ioy after death with Christ.
                  In like maner he exhorteth them that were fallen in persecution to repent in this worlde, while confession may be receiued, and satisfaction and remission made

by the Priest is acceptable to God, which he speaketh generally, as if he had saide, no satisfaction or remission made by the Priest, auaileth to them that are departed.
                  To the place of Chrysostome whiche I cited against himselfe: Pur. 251. Bristowe after he hath remoued the question from the cause to the person, answereth that no friend, no iust man shall helpe him, that dieth in mortal sinne, either committing euil or doing no good. I say no more but as I saide before, Let it be compared with Chrysostomes other saying, the Homilie next before 41. in 1. Cor. and with Allens exhortation in the same Chapter. Pur. 242. If thou yet chance, &amp;c. Out of Ambrose although allowing prayer for the dead, I cited in Psalm. 4. Bene, &amp;c. The Prophet did well to adde on earth, for if he be not cleansed here, he can not be cleansed there. I should haue saide, cleane (saith Bristowe:) for though he be not cleane from veniall sinnes, he may be cleansed there, as also from the temporall debt of his remitted mortall sinnes. But he forgetteth the worde of the Psalme, out of which Ambrose maketh his note: Vt emundet cum in terra, that he may cleanse him on earth: why was it well added on earth, if he might be cleansed after this life? There is no cleansing but on earth.
                  Where Ambrose was alledged by Allen Pur. 104. to proue that euerie man immediately after his death, doth feele that he must looke for in the day of iudgement, I saide Purgatorie 105. I maruell wherefore it is brought in, if it bee not to ouerthrowe Purgatorie. For if it be true, no man feeleth paine after this life, but he that shall feele it eternally. This laste conclusion although Bristowe confesse, that Saint Ambrose him selfe sayeth it expressely in other places, yet he asketh howe I can inferre it of the wordes of Saint Ambrose In ep. ad Rom. Cap. 5. which I inferre not of his wordes, but of Allens wordes, citing the place of Ambrose, as though the wordes were these: And therefore Saint Ambrose saith: that without delay the good poore man

was carryed to rest, and the wicked rich out of hand suffered torments. THAT EVERY MAN (saith he) MAIE FEELE BEFORE THE DAIE OF IVDGEMENT, WHAT HE MVST THEN LOOKE FOR. Bristowe leauing Allen, as he doth commonly, breechelesse, sheweth the wordes of Ambrose to be otherwise, as they are in deede. Which I will rehearse somewhat more at large then Bristowe hath done. 
                        Maxima pars mundi &amp;c. The greatest part of the worlde did not knowe, that God should be their iudge: and very fewe there were, ouer whom death did not raigne. But they ouer whom it raigned, after this death, which is called the first, were receiued of the second deathe vnto paine and destruction to come: but they ouer whome death raigned not, because they haue not sinned in the similitude of the transgression of Adam, were reserued vnder hope vnto the comming of our Sauiour in a free place, as it is read of Abraham, that although he was in the lower partes, yet he was disseuered by a large distance, so that there was a greate goulphe betwene the iust and the sinners: how much more should there be to the godly and iust a c

                        olinge, to the sinners parching heate, to the vngodly burning heate, that it might not be hidden before the iudgement, what euery one was worthy of. This that Ambrose speaketh of the difference of the paines of the damned, before Christ, Bristowe by his accustomed interlacing would haue it seeme, as though he spake of Purgatory: for to sinners he addeth Catholiques, to the impious or vngodly, beretikes. But he marketh not the conclusion, that such heate as they felte after their death, they should feele after the iudgement. Againe, Non latet he translateth might be partly knowne, as though that which is not hidde, is not manifestly and wholy knowne. That I cited out of Saint Ambrose De bono mortis: That death maketh no mans state worse, but such as it findeth in euerie one, such it reserueth to the iudgement to come: Bristowe saith, that Purgatorie altereth not the state of the euill to worse, nor promoteth the state of the

good to better, but euery mans state is according to the merites of his life, nor hee that is cleansed in Purgatory hath his merites multiplied or amplified, but veniall sinnes and temporall debts taken away. In deede if the state of a thing were nothing, but that you will allowe it to be, it were somewhat that you say: but who will say, that he which is in torments in Purgatory, is in as good state as he that is in pleasure or ease of this life? or that he which is discharged of such debts, as you say must be paide in Purgatory, is not in better state, then he that now dieth and must be cast into the scalding house, for such payment? But that you may vnderstand he speaketh not of the death of the wicked, which must abie for it, as Bristow saith: he addeth Ipsa quiete fouet, it cherisheth with rest: this cannot be of the wicked to whō there is no rest, but to the godly, which al immediatly after death enioye rest, notwithstanding they be not all alike good, for of two sortes only Ambrose speaketh, the wicked in torments after death, because of their wicked life, &amp; the godly in rest. He speaketh therefore of the godly that death maketh not their state worse, as he saide immediatly before, Quia portus quidan

                  To the counterfet auctority of Eusebius Emissenus, that hath serued for a patch to peece so many Homilies like the Cukcowes song, I will say no more then I said Pur. 143 The auctority of Bernard in this case I alwaies refused, as a late writer not sufficient to testify of the old faith or errors either.

                  But Bristowe passeth impudence it selfe, while he alledgeth for the same with Allen Enchir. Ad laurent. Cap. 71. Where Augustine saith of the Lordes praier in them that are regenerate. 
                        Delet omnino, &amp;c. That praier altogether putteth away those small and daily sinnes. Also it putteth away euen those sinnes, from which the life of the faithfull that hath bene wickedly ledde, but by

Good Lorde, what will you be ashamed to affirme? There is no such thing in that Chapter, no nor in that which goeth before,

these wordes are not. But after he hath declared his doubt of them, that haue loued perishing goodes, whether they may be saued by purgatorie fire after this life: he saith, Non tamen tales de quibus dictū est quòd regnū Dei nō possidebunt, nisi conuenienter poenitentibus eadem crimina remit

Here although perhaps you may gather, that such persons are not excluded, yet can not you inferre, that for their great sinnes remitted, they should goe thither, but for their small sinnes, such as he spake of before.

                  8 Of Limbus Patrum. Bristowe.
                  
                  I denied not but Augustine was of opinion that the Fulke. fathers before Christ were in hell, no not in that booke Contr. Feliciam. Arrian. But I wished his reason to be marked, wherefore he counted it blasphemous to say, that our sauiours soule was committed to prison in he
                        •
                     , because the soules of good men are immediatly called to Paradise, much more the soule of Christ, who commended the same into his fathers hand, and promised to be with the theefe the same daie in Paradise. To this reason Bristowe aunswereth nothing.
                  In the saying of I renaeus Lib. 3. Cap. 33. cited by Allen, I said it seemeth the name Adam to be taken for a common name of mankinde. But Bristowe wondereth at my blinde ignorance, as not knowing, that Tatianus against whom Irenaeus writeth, denied the saluation of Adam the first man.
                  As though it were necessary therefore, that Adam in this place must signifie that singular man: whereas it is euident, that rendring a cause why Saint Luke beginning the genealogie at Christe, endeth it in Adam,

he disputeth first, of the mystery of our redemption generally, from Christ extending vnto all ages: and saith, 
                        Necesse fuit &amp;c. It was necessary, that our Lorde comming vnto the lost sheepe, and making a recapitulation of so greate a disposition, and seeking his owne workemanship, to saue euen the same man which was made hi
                           •
                         image and similitude, that is Adam filling the times of his condemnation which was for disobedience &amp;c. I see not what greate blindnesse it is here to take Adam for mankinde, as well as the lost sheepe: but admitt he meaneth our first parent, which I denied not: of what skill proceeded it in Allen, to interpret these wordes of Christs descending into hell, which is the matter there in question, when they are manifest of Christs incarnation, to saue all mankinde both the Fathers and vs?
                  The other place of Irenaeus Lib. 5. almost in the end, I saide to ouerthrowe the Popish fantasie of Limbus, I might haue added also of Purgatory, where Irenaeus affirmeth, that Christ after his death, went into such a place, as all his disciples shall rest in, vntill the time of the generall resurrection, which was the place where the deade were before. Bristowe replyeth, he saith not, that the disciples shall goe into the same place yt Christ went, but into an inuisible place &amp;c. whereto I answere, how is it manifest that they shall goe into such a place, but by the example of Christ, who went into the place where the deade were? And how can the text which he citeth, proue it? The disciple is not aboue the master, if euery disciple should not goe into the same place, but as you holde, some to a much better, some to a worse, wheras he speaketh of one inuisible place, appointed by God for all the disciples of Christ.
                  And thus an end of al your caueling vpon such places of the Doctours, as were cited by me. Which how rightly I haue discharged from your manifolde wrangling, that the indifferent teader might more throughly perceiue, I wish him to compare your cauills with those places of mine, which you quote, where he shall see that you haue taken greater paines to pick quarrells at

me, then vsed diligence to defend your Author, whose bookes you haue vndertaken to mainteine: beside that of euerie ten reasons that I bring against him, you haue not touched one.

                  That notwithstanding all which Fulke hath saide against D. Bristowe Allens articles, in his first Book, being of that matter, or also in his other of Purgatorie: euerie one of my 51. demandes, (&amp; therfore also euery one of my motiues, &amp; likewise euerie one of those articles) standeth stil in his force. Euery one (I say) and much more all of them, to make any man to be a Catholike, and not a Protestant.
               
               To Bristowes motiues and demands, I haue answered Fulk
                        〈…〉
                     
                   directly &amp; purposely in a peculiar treatise, yt although he dare not ioyne with me in aunswering of Allen directly, yet he shalbe driuen to defend his owne bragges absolutely, or else forsake his challenge shamefully. The demonstration that he boasteth of in this Chapter is for the most part, nothing else but a quoating of such places, where in his replye hee supposeth to haue confuted mine answeres to Allens articles: vnto which reply, seeing I haue orderly reioyned in euerie point, I will not stand to repeate, where I haue confirmed euery answer, seing this chapter of Bristow may be a sufficient register to al such Chapters, &amp; partes of Chapters where ye same may be foūd. And for such points of his motiues and demaunds whervnto he complaineth, that in mine answere to Allens articles I haue saide nothing, I must require both him and his readers, to haue recourse to my Booke specially written against his saide motiues, and demaundes. For in aunswering Allen, I could not prophecie, what argumentes Bristowe would bring in those bookes set forth by him so many yeres after mine answere to Allen was penned. But where he hath any argument or authoritie not directly answered before, I wil here endeuour to satisfie ye same in such plain order as I haue obserued in al the rest of the booke hitherto.
               
                  
Omitting therefore the two first demandes of Collatio Carthaginensis, and building of the Church, in the third of Going out, he saith that Against our imagined Church in the wilde

This aunswere as senselesse as it is, is borrowed of Stapleton in his demonstration of doctrinall principles, which I haue confuted in a breefe aunswere, shewing that although we seeke not Christ either in the wildernesse or in the secrete places, no not in the Popish pixe, but in heauen only, yet we are to seeke his pilgrime Churche, in what corner of the earth soeuer she be, and seeing the holy Ghost hath expresly a

                  sirmed that she should be hidden in the wildernesse, from the crueltie of the bloudy Dragon, what impudent ignorance, or malicious blindnesse is it in Stapleton and Bristowe, to say we are warned by Christ neuer to seeke the Church in the wildernes? as though we were forbidden to see
                     •
                  e her, or else to acknowledge her to be where somtime she shold be. In the 4, demand of rising after he would maintaine 2 arguments, the first is this. Our first auctors can not be named: Ergo they were none but the Apostles. This argument hath no consequens, and yet the antecedent i
                     •
                   false. For of many of your errors, we name the auctors, and of praier for the dead, Montanus the heretike, vntill you can name vs a Catholique that helde it, which was more auncient then he, and although you would cleare your selues of theft, because you haue not stollen that article but receiued it, yet seeing it came first from a theefe, your possession can not be iust: and therefore ye must restore it to the heathen, from whence Montanus stoale it. Where I brought example of the heretikes, called Acephali, and diuerse other, Pur. 388. to proue that the first auctor of euery heresie can not be named; Bristow saith, that he findeth his name, to haue ben Seuerus, &amp; yt they were but a peece of Eutyches as the Puritanes are of Caluin But when writers dout, &amp; the common voice gaue them their name, because their bead was not knowen, the coni
                     •
                  cture of a name, will

not serue the turne. If they had added nothing to Eutyches, they should haue bene called Eutychians, as for the cauill of Caluine, and the Puritanes, deserueth none aunswere. More like are the friers obseruants and general Franciscanes, to those headlesse heretikes, &amp; the Eutychians. But Bristowe being driuen from the auctor, falleth to the beginning of an heresie, which being shewed to haue bene later then Christ and his Apostles, is indeede an vndoubted argument, to reproue an heresie. And the begining (saith he) is shewed by this, that the primitiue name of Christiās would not serue them, but they must haue new names to be called by. By this demonstratine Logike, none shill so 
                     •
                  ptly be proued heretikes, as Monkes, Friers, Nunnes, &amp;c who disdaining the primitiue name of Christians, haue chosen to themselues newe names, as Benedictines, Franciscanes, Iesuites, &amp;c. Whereas the olde heretikes did not willingly chuse the names that they were called by, but by like names, reproched ye true Catholikes: which argueth yt the new name, except it be chosen by them 
                     •
                  elues, is no good argument to conuince heretikes. Bris. asketh, if the Papists do acknowlege any founders of their faith, but ye Apostles of Christ? yea verily ye Pope &amp; the popish councel, which haue giuen you new articles of faith, yt ye Apostles neuer taught, but y• contrary, as transubstantiation, &amp; cōmunion vnder one kind, &amp;c. That Te
                     •
                  tul. &amp; other latter writers do father praier for ye dead vpon traditiō of ye Apostles, it is no warrant for vs, seeing ye doctrine therof is not found in all the holy canonicall scriptures, but is contrary, to the same, &amp; Montanus is found to be the first that since Christ, taught praier for ye dead. That transubstātiation was lately decreed, he answereth it was the name &amp; not ye thing, as Homousion was alwaies beleued euen before the Nicen Councell, which first receiued yt name. A fit cōparison: but how can Brist. say, yt trā
                  substātiation was alwais beleued? when ye cōmon opiniō almost of al ye scholemen is, yt before ye determination of ye Laterane councel, it was no heresie, to hold impuratiō or adnihilation of the Elements, and he himself confessed in the last Chapter that perfect transubstantiation

was not decreed before the last Tridentine session. The second argument is this: your first auctors can be named after the beginning of the Churches rising wt their newe opinions: Ergo their opnions were heresies, &amp;c. To this argument I answer, denying the antecedent, for we hold no new opinion, but ye foundation of the Prophetes and Apostles, Iesus Christ, beeing the head corner stone. Where I take exceptions to Allens rule. Pur. 413: Bristow expoundeth his meaning, to be of such an opinion as is contrary to the truth, first preached by the Apostles, and vpon his exposition not necessary vpon Allens wordes, chargeth me with nugation or triseling, in adding mine exception, which is the same with his exposition. I pray the reader vouchsafe to peruse the place, and see if there be any droppe of shamefast bloud left in this blundering papist, which blusheth not to scoffe at me for triselings when he doth nothing but cauil and trifle himself, and that without al wit, or reason, truth or likelihoode.
               In the 5. demand of contradiction of heresies in their first arising, where I had shewed, how some fewe plausible errors of praier for the dead &amp; to the dead Ar. 39 by litle and litle preuailed, without any great contradiction mentioned in Histories. Bristowe saith, It is a fonde parte to tell why and how a thing was done, which was neuer done. For the Scripture Es. 62. and August. Ep. 119. Cap. 19. affirme that there ne should be, ne was any such silence in the true pastors, &amp;c. I answere both the Scripture and the Doctor speake of silence, which may bring present ouerthrowe of the Citie, or damnation of the Citizens. Otherwise the true pastors in Saint Augustines time, not only in silence passed, but by speache and writing allowed, the error of communicating of infants and the necessity thereof, as I haue shewed before. And seeing prayer for the deade and to the deade, by the holy Scriptures, are conuinced to be errors, it can be no iustifying of them to say, no man preached against them at their first rising. And seeing the Histories of the auncient time are very fewe and short, it is more boldlie affirmed, then

soundly proued, that no man preached against them. Epiphanius doth not tell who preached against euery heresie at the first arising thereof. And euen some of Origens heresies, of which Bristowe taketh example, slept almost 200. yeares in his bookes, before they were openly contradicted in the daies of Hieronyme, Ruffine and Augustine. Touching that I alledge of the mystery of iniquity working in the Apostles time. 2. Thess. 2. Bristowe chargeth me to say, that the Church of Christ wrought this mystery of iniquity, wherein he doth me open iniury: for I knowe it was Satan which wrought it, but yet in the Church where Antichrist should sitte, and not without it. He asketh whether my text say, There was no preaching against it. I answere my text saith, it was a mystery not reuealed, and therefore could not at the first be openly preached against. But Antichrist being openly shewed, was preached against by the two witnesses, Apoc. 11. although he were not espied in the first mystery of iniquity, yea when he was yet in fashioning he was preached against by Irenaeus, Pollycrates, and others Ar. 36. and in this book. Cap. 9.
               The case of Cyprian and the Affricanes, being true pastors and yet contradicting the truth, and other true pastors denying that such as were baptised by heretikes were to be rebaptised, I haue clearely set down Pur. 413. but that Bristowe can do nothing but cauill.
               Allens rule is of the first rising of the persons, wherevnto I require to be added that their opinion must also be newe, which if Bristowes blinde malice could haue seene, he needed not to haue painted his margent, with so many quotations, to proue that the true opinion was auncient and perpetuall.
               Where I shewed Ar. 93. that the Pope in secret, &amp; not by open contradiction, caused a most horrible blasphemous lake, called the Gospell of the holy Ghost, &amp;c. written by the Friers to be priuily burned, for shaming their order, which continued. 55. yeares, without reprehension of the Pope, or any, but such as were accounted heretikes, Bristowe calling it fauourably, but a

new scandalous booke, asketh what fault it was. Verely such a fault, as proued him to be more zelous of ye glorie of beggerly friers, then of Christ and his Church, neither can it be shadowed by the example of Augustine, at the first forbearing the name of Pelagius, while there was hope of amendment in him, and he not throughly vnderstoode his heresie. But contrary wise the Pope fauoureth the blasphe

               Where I saide, this was an argument from mans auctority negatiuely, &amp; therfore nothing worth: No man preached against Purgatory, and prayer for the dead, at their first entry: therefore they are true. Bristow saith, it is according to the Scriptures, Fathers and Histories, that All heres

Bristowe saith he knoweth not in what Logike, I haue that axiome. He is a greate straunger in Aristotel, that knoweth not yt a carcase, although he be called a man, yet is not a man in deede: moreouer he chargeth me to reason so my self in ye seuenth demand, where indeed I do only deride the vaine kinde of reasoninge from the name to the thing, when the name is not rightly giuen, retorting the argument vpon the Papists, who of vs are called heretiks, as we are of them.
               But Saint Augustine reasoneth of the name of the Catholique Church.

And although vnto the godly, notwithstanding the corruptions, it was still the Temple of God, yet had not the vngodly the Temple of God, nor were in it, as in Gods Temple, but as in a theeuish denne, so are papists in the Catholique Church.
               Where I said, supposing we were not called Catholique
                     •
                  , we should not be in worse case then Christ &amp; his

Apostles, who not only had not that name, but were of the Iewes (who were as rightly called Gods people, as the papists are called the Christian worlde) called heretikes and deceiuers. Bristowe biddeth me bate an ace of that, except I can shewe by predictions of the Prophets, the reprobation of the Christian worlde, in these daies, as they shew the reprobation of the Iewes in those daies. A wretched refuge, as though papists were only named the Christian worlde, or that the Iewes were reprobated in the time of Christes preaching, or the Apostles either, before the extreme obstinate refusing of the Gospell. Or as if it were not sufficient, to shewe the popish apostasie from the faith by those vndoubted notes, which the spirite speaking euidently doth giue of them. 1. Tim. 4. Beside this, Bristowe derideth me, for requiring the Iewes to vse those names which they neuer hearde of. And is Bristowe so well redde in the Scriptures, that the name of true Church was neuer hearde of the Iewes in his opinion, as for the name of Catholique I required it not of them, neither do I thinke we ought to be tried by the bare name of Catholique, seeing we beleeue not barely and simply the Catholique, but the holy, Catholique, and Apostolique Church. Which Church is not called Catholique, because it should be euery where, (for that it neuer was, nor neuer shalbe) but because that wheresoeuer it be in parts, it is one bodie of Christ. But here Bristowe taketh me vp for haulting, charging me to be the first of all heretikes, that say it is called Catholica, because it is Vna: but he playeth his olde parts, for I say it is Catholique, because that being in diuerse parts, it is one, so that my reason is not only of vnitie but of vniuersality of the Church, which is Catholique in all the parts of it, being knitte in one, and not of being in euery particular place of the worlde, nor at all times in most places of the worlde. And with this holy Catholique Church of the whole worlde, our Church doth and alwaies hath communicated, when it was not so openly nor abundantly spredde in so many Nations as it is now. And therefore Augustine in the place by Bristowe

quoted Coll. 3. Die, &amp;c. reproueth as well the Romane; as the Affricane Donatisme, whereinto Bristowe manifestly incurreth, when most impudently he affirmeth, that the olde fathers in their Creede, beleeuing one, holy, Catholique and Apostolique Church, meant the Romane Church, as though the vnity, holynes, vniuersality, and Apostolique foundation of Christs Church, were nothing but the Romish Church.
               Where I proue, that the Popish Church is not in euery part of the worlde, and therefore cannot be called Catholique, in that respect: Bristowe saith it is iumpe the argument of Cresconius, and referreth vs for the answere to Saint Augustine. Con

For Augustine confesseth the Church is not called Catholique, because it is euery where, (for it was not in all places in his time) but because it is to be dilated into all parts of the world, whereas the Donatists helde, it to be only in Affrica as the Papists only in a peece of Europa. And therfore it is false, that Bristow saith, both the interpretations of Catholique giuen by Saint Augustine De gen. ad Lit. imperf. Cap. 1. Because she is vniuersally perfect, and because she is spredde ouer all the worlde, agree to their mother Romish Babylon, for she hath nothing perfect, neither was she euer nor at this day is spreade ouer all the worlde, no not wh

Of Aerius there is no question, but he was an heretike, although not in that matter Bristowe meaneth.

               Where I saide, the Deuill stirred vp tyrantes, Heretikes, Popes, Saracenes, and Turkes to destroy ye Church: Who (saith Bristowe) that counteth Popes to be heretikes, would so deuide? Verily he that counteth Popes to be in an higher degree of impietie, then particular heretikes, namely to be autors of Apostasie &amp; Antichristes.
               Where I obiect against this Popishe rule, that the true Christians were of the Arrians called, heretikes, Bristow asketh whether they were of the Arrians commonly called Heretikes? Yea verily, as commonly as we are of Papists. Bristow saith, if we should in our talke &amp; writing, say heretikes simpliciter, as they doe, we could not be vnderstanded to speake of them. Yes in deede, as well as they among their owne, are vnderstood to speake of vs. And what other thing is ment by the name of Papistes, but heretikes, and traitours, Antichristians, and Apostataes, enimies to God their Prince, &amp; their country.

Cyprian,

S. Augustine, Optatus, &amp;c. Or if we haue any better moniments of any nations religiō, he biddeth me to name it, and let vs trie it betweene vs. How often haue I named the holy Scriptures, the best and the onely true moniment, whereby we may trie what Gospell the Apostles preached, and into what faith they baptised the nations? And as for those whome you name for Affrike, although they testifie of some corruptions receiued and allowed in their time, yet I dare take them for triall of the greatest controuersies that are betweene vs, of iustification by grace, and not by merite of workes, of the Popes antichristian supremacie, of the Lordes supper, of worshipping of images, and many other controuersies. As for that brabbling of conuerting of nations by them, or vs, it is not worth the while, but a matter of meere contention, which can not be decided, but by triall whether they or we holde the true faith of the Gospell, for into that were all nations conuerted, that were turned by the true Apostles. As for the conuersion of any nation into false Christianitie, proueth not the conuerters to be Apostles. But Bristowe bragging of their wonderfull conuersion of nations of India and Affrica, (which no man reporteth, but lying Friers, and shamelesse Papistes) seemeth to denie, that any were conuerted vnto false religion, by any false Apostles or Heretikes. And first, where I saide, there are people in Aethiopia, which, by circumcision and obseruation of the lawe, declare that they were conuerted by the false apostles: Bristowe opposeth the authoritie of Eusebius, reporting the conuersion of Aethiopia to haue beene of the right stampe, &amp;c. imagining belike that Aethiopia is so smal a countrie, that it were not possible for one peece to be conuerted into true Christianitie, and another part into corrupt. That there are such people as I saide, Munster in his Geographie of Aethiopia, doth testifie. As for the fable of their Emperours submission, and the Abbots approbation of Poperie in all pointes, may serue to play mocke holiday among the Papistes, they can haue no credite among vs. As great a mockerie it is, that Bristow

abuseth the saying of Irenaeus, concerning the Church of Rome in his time, 
                     
                        lib. 3. cap. 3. In qua &amp;c. In which alwaies of them that are round about, hath bene kept that tradition or deliuerie of doctrine, which is from the Apostles. But the praise of the Romane Church of that time, is the shame of the Popish synagogue of this time, which hath forsaken that tradition, and embraced newe doctrine, neuer heard of, from the Apostles daies, vnto the time of Irenaeus.
               Where I say it is manifest, that the nations of the Alanes, Gothes, and Vandales, were first conuerted by the Arrians: Bristowe replieth, that in so saying, I declare that I neuer read the ecclesiastical stories: such is Bristows Logike. It were possible I had read them, and forgotten them. But what could I either reade or remember in the places by him quoted? First, Socrates lib. 2. cap. 32. where it is said, that Vlphilas Bishop of the Gothes assented to an Arrian or neutrall confession, giuen at Constantinople, whereas before that time he had followed the steps of Theophilus, which was Bishop of the Gothes, and being present in the Nicene Councel, had subscribed thereto, &amp; he also had embraced the faith confirmed at Nice. First of ye Alanes, &amp; Vandales here is no word, nor in any of the places folowing; of the Gothes it is said, that Theophilus sometime their Bishop, was of right faith, and Vlphilas also, before his subscription, and consequently a fewe that were conuerted to Christianitie, before the heresie of Arius. But what saith Socrates of the first nation of the Gothes, that was conuerted, and of the second also, lib. 4. cap. 27. which is the second place quoted? There were two nations of the Gothes, the one gouerned by Phritigernes, ye other by Athanarichus: Phritigernes being oppressed by the power of Athanarichus, sought aide of Valens the Arrian Emperor, and obtaining it, put Athanarichus to flight. 
                     Quae causa fuit &amp;c. Which was the cause (saith Socrates) that verie manie of the Barbarians receiued the Christian faith. For Phritigernes, that he might shewe him selfe thankefull for his benefite receiued of the Emperor, beganne to embrace his religion,

and to exhort his people to doe the same. And for that cause manie Gothes which then to please the Emperors humour, had addicted them selues to the Arrian sect, vnto this time cleaue fast vnto it. At the same time V

But truely I doe not thinke, that this was the onely cause, whie the whole nation of the Gothes vnto this time, is adioyned to the Arrians: but yt Vlphilas their bishop, although in the beginning he dissented nothing from ye Catholike Church: yet afterward in the reigne of Constantius, through lacke of knowledge, he was present at the Councel held at Constantinople, with Eudoxius and Acacius, which were of the number of Bishops that had bene in the Nicen Councel. And so being become an Arrian, separated the whole nation of Gothes frō the Catholike faith. This storie sheweth, that Phritigernes was not the only cause of conuersion of the Gothes: for Vlphilas the Bishop of those fewe, that were before that time christened, being long before peruerted into Arrianisme, was the principall cause of turning both the nations vnto Christianisme infected with Arrianisme. But Theodoret,

Secondly he asketh is there so much as any mention of the twelue Apostles, preaching to any nation of the Gentiles? There is mention of the twelue Apostles preaching to the Iewes, and of their agreement in doctrine to be preached to the Samaritans and Gentiles, although it was neither possible, nor needfull, nor conuenient, that they should all twelue in person goe to euery nation. But what faith so euer any one preached to any nation, the same did they all preach without difference in euerie nation, that they conuerted. There is not one of the articles of the Creede necessarie to saluation, but it is to be proued by the Actes of the Apostles, that they did preach it. But Bristowe wil tell vs an other cause, why that booke was written. No sir (saith he) that booke was written to shewe, onely the beginning of the Church (according to the prophets) to wit, at Ierusalē, &amp; among the Iewes, and the taking of it from them for their deserts, and giuing it to the Gentiles, euen from Ierusalem the head of the Iewes, to Rome the head of the Gentiles. If this were the only purpose of the Euangelist, (as Bristowe most impudently affirmeth) he should haue spared much labour in setting foorth the sermons, and summe of the doctrine, which the Apostles preached both to the Iewes and Gentiles. But let vs heare Bristowe goe forward. And there Saint Luke endeth it, not caring to tell, so much as the fulfilling of that which our Lord had foretold Act. 27. to Saint Paule (in whose person this translation was wrought, and not in S. Peters for causes too long to be here rendered) Thou must stand before the Emperor. Because his purpose was no more, but to shewe the newe Ierusalem of the Christians, and so to leade them to it, to knowe what are the particulars that the Apostles taught. If this be true, all the testimonie and report that he maketh of their doctrine, was beside his purpose: yea,

the historie of the gospell which he writ of all things, that Iesus beganne to do and teach, was out of this purpose. And he tooke the wrong way in writing his gospel to Theophilus, to teach him the certaintie of those things wherof he had bene instructed, as Saint Luke him selfe had receiued of the Apostles them selues, whereas according to Bristowes imaginatiue purpose, seeing there had ben manie writings of the gospel alreadie, he should haue sent him home to the newe Ierusalem of the Christians, and so haue left him to it, to knowe what are the particulars the Apostles taught. But where on gods name learne wee, that whore of Babylon that sitteth vpon the seuen hilles, Apoc. 17. to be this newe Ierusalem on earth? when S. Paul. Gal. 4. bringeth all Christians from the earthly Ierusalem, vnto the heauenly Ierusalē which is aboue, and is the mother of vs all: not to an other Ierusalem on earth, and that the mother of all abhominations of the earth. Apoc. 17. And howe falleth it out, that S. Luke hauing a purpose, so long and certainely continued, and so necessarie for the Church, not in one word commendeth to vs this newe Ierusalem, on the seuen hils, nor in one word maketh mention of that, which only changeth (if any thing can chaunge hell into heauen) Rome into Ierusalem, namely the translation of Peters chaire or his person, or the least haire of his head, or thred of his garment to Rome? But this belike is reserued among the Apocriphal causes; as these are, why the translation was in the person of S. Paule, and not of S. Peter.
               Where I required one of those nations, to whome the Apostles preached purgatorie or praier for the dead, to be named out of the Actes of the Apostles: Bristowe answereth, continuing his former speach: And so withall you haue one of those nations named; and that no common one, to wit, the Romanes, which receiued of the Apostles not only that article you require, but all the rest which at this time it hath, &amp;c. When this is shewed out of the Actes of the Apostles, or any other Canonical scripture, I am answered. Where I require it to be proued, that the same Apostle which first conuerted Britanie, taught praiers or sacrifice for the deade:

Bristowe answereth, If you require vs to proue it out of the Scripture, considering that the Scripture doth not tell of our lands conuersion you declare your selfe to be but a pratler. At the least wise you declare, that you cannot proue it out of ye scriptures. But we can proue out of ye scriptures, euery article yt we beleeue, to haue bene taught by yt Apostle or Apostolike man, whosoeuer first preached the saith of Christ in this lande, although our landes conuersion be not by name mentioned in scripture. Yet seeing the doctrine of euerie one of ye Apostles was the same yt is expressed in ye scriptures, we are able to proue, that he preached the same which we beleue, considering yt we beleue al that is written in the holy scriptures. As for ye confirmation of Eleutherius, which Bristowe saith was an accomplishing of yt which was begun by ye Apostles &amp; Romanes, if he meane of a supply of doctrine, it is false: for Christianitie hauing bene in Brittanie planted by the Apostles in the time of Tiberius, and continued more then a 100. yeares before Eleuthe

                  ke of troubles, in which Bristow placeth me, because I do quietly cōfesse, yt Augustine brought much superstitiō into this Island, &amp; yet: not the whole substance of Poperie, but the principal &amp; most necessarie grounds of Christianitie: where I affirmed yt in many things the faith &amp; religion of the old Saxons, was contrarie to yt the Papists now do hold, as by diuers monuments of antiquitie may be proued, Bristowe with a double negatiue, would haue it seeme impossible, Because in S. Bedes storie, and in all his workes▪ &amp;c. we find nothing against the Pope, nor against any one point of his doctrine. What I haue found in S. Bedes storie, and other monuments of the Saxons religion, I haue set forth in confutation of Stapletons Fortresse. As for that printed Saxon Homily; which is against real presence &amp; transubstantiation, which Bristowe saith, was so soone &amp; so diligently called in againe, it is abroad in ye hands of many▪ neuer called in, that euer I heard of, but hath since the first setting forth of it, bene printed three or foure times, in Maister Foxes booke of Actes and Monumentes.
               
                  
In the tenth and twelfth Demands of Miracles and visions, where I had cited the admonition of the Apostle, 2. Thessalon. 2. that the comming of Antichrist should be in all lying signes and wonders: Bristowe asketh me, what Scripture telleth me, that after the reuelation of Antichrist, there shall be none but feigned miracles? Wheras I inferred no such thing vpon the text, but shew euen that which he blameth me not to haue shewed, howe to knowe seigned miracles from vnfeigned, namely by the doctrine which they are saide to confirme, according to the Scripture. Deut. 13.
               Where I saide, that Augustine De vnit. eccle. cap. 16. will allowe no miracles and visions for sufficient proofes, without the authoritie of Scriptures: Bristowe saith, I doe shamefully abuse my reader, for he saith expressely, What so euer such thinges are done in the Catholike Church, therefore they are to be allowed, because they are done in the Catholike Church. Yea sir, but it followeth that the Church is not shewed to be Catholike, because such things are done, but as he saith there and else where, onely by the Scriptures. But Bristowe will haue me allowe all the miracles that Saint Augustine speaketh of, because they were done in the Catholike Church. As though Saint Augustine made that the sufficient cause to allowe any thing that was done or saide to be done, without ioyning that they were done to confirme the Catholike faith, Cyprians miracles could not iustifie his error. In the Popish Church, the sectes of Dominicanes and Franciscanes in their dissention, about the Conception of the virgin Marie, boasted both of their miracles, yet Bristowe will not I weene allowe both their miracles, except he will allowe both their opinions, which were contradictorie. Againe, many things are feigned, euen in the Catholike Church by peruerse zeale, to confirme truth, as ye historie of Paule and Tecla, confessed by a Priest of Asia Tert. de bapt. Neither wil Bristow I thinke defend, yt al ye miracles contained in the Alcoran of Frances, Vitas patrum, Legend

Festiual, and liues of so manie Saints as are written, be all true, and none feigned, although they all serue to proue Poperie. Wherefore it may be, that euen some of those miracles that S. Augustine doth report, might of emulation and vnordered zeale be feigned by some Catholikes, to winne credite to the Church, against heretikes. That Luther and Caluine whome he affirmeth, not able to heale a lame horse, attempted wonders, it is as impudent a lie, and grosse forgerie, as that Li

                  danus telleth, that Luther was begotten of the diuell. And yet there be diuers horseleaches among the Protestants, that haue healed more lame horses then euer S. Loy did, either when he liued, or since he was worshipped of the Papistes as an excellent horseleach.
               Passing ouer 5. Demandes, which he doth only name: In the 18. of destroying idolatrie, he saith, that to all that he said, I say nothing, but like a cuckowe: You haue not destroied idolatrie, but set vp idolatrie, not waying (saith Bristowe) that I tell him according to the Prophets, that we haue throughly conuerted all nations from idolatrie, that we haue made them forget also the names of their idols. In deede, that which Bristow telleth me, is of great weight, and therefore I am belike to blame, to wey it no more but as bare wordes without matter, and winde without reason or authoritie. Otherwise I thinke I haue proued, that the Papistes haue conuerted fewe nations from Paganisme, and them whome they haue turned, they haue rather chaunged the idols, then taken away the idolatrie, or rather the verie names, then the idols themselues, seeing there was neuer an idol almost among the Gentiles, but they retaine the idolatrie, vnder the name of one Saint or other. They had Castor and Pollux, you haue Loy and George: they had Februa or Febris, you haue Fiacre: that which Iuno Lucina was to their women, ye virgine Marie is to yours. &amp;c.
               In the 19 Demaund of Kings and Emperors, Bristowe saith, that although I chalenge the Kings of the first 600 yeares, to be of our religion, yet I bring no proofe at all, as though the proofe of the doctrine of saluation receiued in that time, which we hold, is no proofe at all.

First cap. 58. there is nothing, but that Constantine builded a Church, which should be called the memorie of the Apostles: Cap. 59. followeth the description of the same Church and his intent, that the memorie of Christes Apostles by that sumptuous building, should be continued alwaies among all nations: Cap. 60. his purpose is shewed, that he being buried there, might be made partaker of the praiers, that should be there made in the honour of the Apostles: meaning the praiers made to God, which manie moued by deuotion of that glorious memorie of the Apostles, should make: Cap. 66. is nothing but a description of a magnificent funerall pompe prepared: Cap. 71. are those praiers which the people made for his soule yt I spake of, and beside that

The tombe of the thrise happie soule, beautified with the name of the Apostles, and adioined to the people of God, and made worthie of the diuine ceremonies and mysticall liturgie or seruice, and inioining the communion of holie praiers. But of sacrifice for his soule, with the intercession of the Apostles, in whose honour it was offered, at their reliques, there is no word: although by any figure you vnderstand the Emperors tombe whereof he speaketh, to signifie his soule, which is rather a rhetoricall exornation, shewing howe his tombe was honoured, as cap. 67. he sheweth that all the princes of the armie, and the Senate, worshipped his dead bodie, euen as they did when he was aliue: which vaine pompe, he commendeth as an honour appointed and allowed by God, to be giuen to the Emperors. But in effect you can shewe

no more of Constantius fauouring of your religion, but in that one error of praying for the dead: to which I oppose his commandement, laide vpon Metriades bishop of Rome, to heare the cause of Cecilianus, E

That I omit his admission of the appeale from the bishop of Rome, and other like matters, shewing his souereigne authoritie ouer ye bishop of Rome and other Prelates. I said, that although Theodoret report, that Theodosius the younger, praied for his parents foules, yet the storie saith not, that he praied to Saint Chry so stome for them. Bristow opposeth the Tripartite storie, and Theodoret in Latine lib. 5. cap. 35. where is nothing of the matter, &amp; 36. where Theodoret in his owne words speaking of the tombe of Chrysostome, saith of Theodosius, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      : He setting vpon the tombe, both his eyes and forehead, offered a supplication for his parents, desiring pardon for them, that had done iniurie of ignoraunce. These wordes inforce not praier to Saint Chrysostome, although praier to the dead, was at that time erroniously practised. That Allen citeth out of Ambrose, of Honorius standing by the holie altars, while the solemnitie of his fathers funerall was celebrated, maketh little to proue Honorius to haue bene a Papist, although in that point I denie not (which can not yet of those wordes be proued) that he might be occupied in praier for the deade, according to the errour of his time. One errour can not make a man to be altogether of the Popish faith, who is knowne to haue bene of that religion which Ambrose setteth foorth in his writings, contrarie to Papistrie, in the most, and most necessarie pointes vnto saluation. The 40. dayes minde, which Allen would begge out of that place, to resemble their Popish monethes minde, I haue sufficiently reproued, by shewing the continuance of the fourtie daies solemnitie, without intermission. That the last day was one of the fourtie, and kept with singular solemnitie (as is vsuall in such cases) which Bristowe opposeth, can not make a iust resemblance

of the Popish mone thes mindes, which are a renouation of a mourning or solemnitie intermitted. Where I challenge the Christian Emperors which were before the generall desection, to haue bene of our religion: Bristowe in a lurious rage, noteth in the margent, Sce the impudent heretike, them whome he condemned before. But who is this impudent heretike, that condemned those Christian Emperors before? or where is there any word of their condemnation? Is there no difference betweene reprouing of an errour, and condemuing of the person? But let that passe among Bristowes impudent and malicious slaunders. The Kings of the earth (saith he) haue not committed fornication with the whore of Babylon, when they humblie adored the Church of Rome, and licked the dust of her feete, as they are commaunded by the Prophet. Esai. 49. 60. &amp;c. This shall be confessed when it is proued, that the Popish Church is the spouse of Christe, and not the strumpet of Babylon, although the Prophet speake not of bodily bowing, kissing, or licking. Where I name Ziska &amp; Procopius, and George king of Bohemia defenders of ye Protestants: Bristow saith, it was an 100. yeares before the name, &amp; much more the religiō of ye Protestants was coined, as though their religiō might not be before yt name was vsed to cal thē by? But yt Edward ye third was a Wicleuist, who euer heard? saith Bristow. And who euer heard me say or write, that he was a Wicleuist? I saide, Ar. 34 yt king Edward &amp; other noble men in his time defended Wickleues cause: and for yt you may read at large M. Foxes storie of Wickleue. Cōcerning the booke of Caro lus Magnus, against images, I haue aunswered Sander &amp; Bristowe else where. The booke of Berttam is entituled ad Carolum magnum, although Trithemius say, it was vnto Charles ye king, brother of Lotharius, ye antiquitie of which inscription, is elder then Trithemius, except he bring better arguments then his bare affirmation. But Bertram went about the bush in Bristows fansie, &amp; durst not openly declare his opinion against real presence &amp; transubstantiation, therefore Charles ye King or Emperor did hold this opinion. He yt will read ye booke, shal see he doth plainly expresse

his iudgement, against the corporall presence, and as for transubstantiation, there was no question thereof in his time.
               In the 21. Demaund of Churches, where I say the Papistes had wonne no more, if we could shewe neuer a Church, but such as haue bene builded by Papistes, and to Popish vses, then the idolaters against the Apostles, which could shewe no temples, but builded vnto idols: Bristowe saith, the challenge were not one, because the Apostles renounced both those temples and their religion, we renounce Popish religion, but not all their Churches. The cause wh
                     •
                  e the Apostle renounced their temples, was for that manie of them were not for the vse of Christian religion, although if credite may be giuen to our countrie histories, the Pagans temples were conuerted to Christian Churches, both by ye Brytons &amp; Saxons. But those conuerters, saith Bristowe, were the founders of them: be it so, yet were they not the builders of them. Yet such as were builded by Christian princes, were builded that their soules might be praied for in them, as that Church of the twelue Apostles builded by Constantine the great, whereof mention is before &amp;c. Of so manie Chruches as he builded, onely in building that one, he had that erronious conceit. Where I say, the olde Churches were builded onely in the honor of God, and the Popish temples in the honor of creatures, Saints, and Angels: Marie wellymet, quod Bristowe: They were called Basilicae Martyrum &amp; Apostolorū, the Apostles and the Martyrs Churches, &amp;c. Ergo, They were not builded to the honour of God onely, but to the honour of creatures, when the olde writers whome I cite Ar. 53. 55. affirme, that a temple belongeth onely to God. And Augustine expresly denieth, that they were the temples, but the memories of those Martyrs, whose names they bare, and as foraltars, he vtterly denieth them vnto creatures.
               Where I said, that Constantine made his great grants to the married Bishops of Rome: Bristowe crieth, blessing on Iouinian. Whie Bristowe, Was there neuer any Bishop of Rome married? Was there no priest married

in Hierome and Augustines time, although Iouinian could not persuade anie priest which had purposed continencie to marrie? To that I saide of manie of the Cathedrall Churches in England, builded for preachers and their wiues to dwell in, Bristowe saith, I haue wonne a whetstone as bigge as a mountaine, but against the authoritie of the histories, Ranulph. Cest. Math. Westm. Petriburgens. and other which I cited, Bristow bringeth nothing, but railing in filthie termes, meete for the colledge of Cardinals life, &amp; not for the holie estate of matrimonie.
               Where I shewe the differing forme of the chauncels &amp; altars of the auncient Churches, with crosse yles from the latter Popish erections: Bristowe maketh me a souden proctor of theirs, as though a chauncel and altar, a crosse barre, might not be named but by a Papist. Yea, he maketh me contrarie to my selfe, for saying that Popish chauncels, which are at the East end of Churches, are but late additions: and sanctifieth, that we can abide no chauncels, no crosse yles, no length to the East, &amp;c. of which things we make small account, either to haue thē, or to be without them. But it is more materiall, that he saith, Cōstantinus had tabernaculum crucis, a tabernacle or moucable Church of the crosse, wheras we can abide no crosse or roode in our Churches, Euseb. in vit. Const. lib. 2. cap. 12. lib 4. cap. 56, Sozomen lib. 1. cap. 8. The two latter places shewe, that in his warres he vsed to haue a tent or tabernacle, as a Church, for praier and ministration of the sacraments: the first place onely calleth it tabernaculum crucis, which might be of ye forme; but of any crosse that was in it, there is no mention, and much lesse of a rood, which is a crosse with an image on it. As for the crosse which Paulinus the superstitious Bishop of Nola, saith was kept in the Church of Ierusalem, worshipped by the Bishop and the people, if it were true, yet it proueth not creeping to the crosse on Good Friday, as Bristow saith, for there might be worshipping without creeping, or Popish worshipping either. Againe, worshipping of that same crosse that Christ died on, proueth not creeping to

any idol of it. Finally, where he would proue out of Paulinus and Beda, the multitude of altars in one Churche, he laboureth in vaine. Eusebius whome I cited, is cleare both of the vnitie of the altar in his time, and of the manner of standing, which was not after the popish manner. Of like wisedome it is, that he will not allowe me to talke of chalices of wood and glasse, because I say their vestiments be as good stuffe as their chalices, which the olde Church knewe not. Thereof he chargeth me not

Yes I haue read it, but I spake of an elder Church then Constantines time, in which such pompe was not vsed. And yet that robe is lewdly translated of Bristowe a cope. Although neither the Papists in baptisme, haue alwaies, or ordinarily worne a cope. The rest that he citeth, out of antiquitie for gorgeous attire, and golden chalices, partly is false, and partly superfluous. For Ornatus, is by him translated into ornaments. Valens commended Saint Basil, Quòd tanto ornatu támque decenter &amp;c, that with so great comelinesse and so decently, he exercised his priestlie office. Againe, Sozomen, lib. 8. cap. 21. sheweth that Chrysostomes priestes taken by force in ornatu vt erant, in their attire as they were, which was but a white garment, as appeareth by diuers places of Chrysostome in Matth. Hom. 85. &amp;c. Likewise he asketh whether there were such neede for redeeming captiues, building of Churches, or that requies defunctorum might be at the buriall of the deade, that chalices were broken and solde, seeing Ambrose alloweth, but these three causes of breaking and selling of chalices. As though Ambrose spake of buying of Trentals of Masses, with the price of the chalices, where he saith, Off. lib. 2. cap. 28. Nemo potest dolere, quia in sepulturis Christianor
                        ••
                     n requies defunctorum est. No man can be griened, because in the buriall of Christians, the rest of the deade is. Which he speaketh of enlarging the places of buriall, which is ye third cause,

Yet he asketh, if I be not ashamed, to cite such places of antiquitie, seel hate chalices, because they be chalices, and because they be consecrated? Whereas I saide nothing against the necessarie vse of cuppes in the Communion, but of the superstitious pompe of the Papistes in their golden chalices, and idolatrous manner of consecrating them: while they suffer the poore to sterue for lacke of necessarie susten
                     •
                  nce, but once againe most impudently he chargeth Ambrose to say, that the sacred chalice is called there a vessell of our Lordes bloud, and golde in which our Lordes bloud is powred: where he speaketh of breaking the cuppes, before they be solde, least they should offensiuely be abused to wicked purposes. But there, saith he, is not any such worde of them, and in the middest of the chapter, where these wordes are, they are not spoken of the materiall cuppe, but of the godlie vse of them, when they are solde to redeeme captiues, aunswering the obiection of such thinges, that be once dedicated to Gods seruice. 
                     Ille verus est thesaurus Domini &amp;c. That is a true treasure of the Lorde, which worketh that which his bloud wrought. Then I acknowledge a vessell of the Lordes bloud, when I see redemption in both, that the cup may redeeme from the enimie, them whome the bloud hath redeemed from finne.
               
               And againe,

I acknowledge the bloud of Christe powred into the golde, not onely to haue made it redde, but also to haue imprinted in it the vertue of diuine operation, by the gift of redemption.

                  e and siluer in which they did sacrifice, and set their waxe candles. But what answere did Laurence the Deacon returne, what chalices or candlestickes did he render, but the poore that were relieued by the aimes of the Church and sale of the golden vessels, if they had any, as witnesseth S. Ambrose in the place before cited?
               Where I affirme, the auncient Churches were without images, because the tempse of God, and images can not agree &amp;c. Bristowe saith, I may roll in such rhetorike before fooles, that receiue our absurde principles, to wit, That the idols of the Pagans, were images of the Christians. But thinketh Bristowe, that any of our auditors is so foolish, to beleeue so absurde a principle, as he is malitious in feigning vs to affirme such an impossible paradoxe? I am sure, it neuer entred into the opinion of any preacher, to imagine, that the idols of the Pagans were the images of Christians. But this we say, that Popish images, although they be not the same that were the images of ye Heathen, yet they are as abhominable idols as theirs, &amp; the worshipping of them as much to be abhorred of all true Christians, as the worshipping of the images of the Gentiles, and for proofe of that, neither you, nor Sander shall euer finde me non plus, as you say you make me, by denying yt absurd principle, which is of your owne fantasticall imagination, and not of our ignorant and vnlearned affirmation, as you feigne it. As touching our liuings, we are nothing discouraged by the storie of Ambrose de Basilicis tradendis, but that we may enioie them with a better conscience, then you compare vs, with the Arrians, and our most Christian Prince, to the Arrian Empresse.
               In the 22. Demaund of seruice of the Church, howe vainly he affirmeth the seruice of the primitiue Church, to be the same that the Popish Church now hath, because

two errors of praier for the dead, and to Saintes, were in the olde Church, of three or foure hundreth yeares after Christ, I will not tarie to declare. But where I note out of S. Augustine, affirming that no sacrifice ought to be offered to Martyrs: seeing praier is a sacrifice, that therefore it ought to be offered only to God: and that Martyrs were not called vpon in the time of the sacrifice, but onely named for remembrance: Bristowe to proue that they were called vpon, contrarie to the expresse wordes of Augustine, citeth Augustine, Tract in Ioan. 84. speaking of the blessed Martyrs: 
                     Non sic eos commemoramus &amp;c. We doe not so rehearse them, as other that rest in peace, that we also pray for them, but rather yt they may pray for vs, that we may cleaue to their steppes. These words proue not, that they did in publike seruice call vpon the Martyrs with solemne praiers, but onely interpret, what Augustine supposed the meaning of the publike liturgie to be, in that place, where the Martyrs were named among other that are in rest, for whome they did pray, as appeareth more plainely, by the other place, which Bristowe quoteth 
                     
                        De verb. Apost. 17. Perfectio tamen, &amp;c Yet there is some kinde of perfection in this life, vnto which the holie Martyrs are come. Therfore the Ecclesiasticall discipline hath that which the faithfull doe knowe, when the Martyrs are rehearsed in that place at the altar of God, where praier is not made for them; but for the rest of the departed, that are rehearsed, praier is made. For it is an iniurie to pray for a Martyr, by whose praiers we ought to be commended. Note also in the former sentence, that they praied for them that did rest in peace; therefore they praied not for deliuerance out of purgatorie, where they are saide to be in paine without rest. The other places, which he noteth, of priuate persons praying to Saints, proueth not, that such praier was vsed in the publike seruice of the Church, which although perhaps it were not syncere in all points, yet was it much elder, than the error of inuocation of Saintes. Where I note that no sacrifice was to be offered vnto Martyrs: Bristowe saith, it is to be vnderstoode, of externall sacrifice,

as though the Christians had any but eucharisticall or of prosperities But admitting his distinction of externall and internall sacrifice, howe are the Gentiles answered by Saint Augustine, that we worship not Saintes as Gods, when we offer spirituall sacrifice to them, which is most proper to God, which is a spirit, and challengeth the spirituall worship vnto him selfe? You might as well graunt them externall temples, as spirituall sacrifice, and much rather. For if they must haue spirituall and internall sacrifice, they must haue a spirituall and internal temple, wherein and vpon which, it must be offered; which is all one, as if you will dispossesse the holy Ghost of his temple, and set vp an other altar in mans heart, to offer vp sacrifice vnto Martyrs therevpon. But Bristowe, as it were, giuing ouer his former distinction, saith praier to Saintes, is no more a sacrifice to Saintes, then those dishes of meate, which of some Christians were superstitiously brought into the Churches, as Augustine sheweth, to be sanctified by the merites of the the Martyrs, de ciuit. lib. 8. cap 27. But the Prophet saith, A troubled spirite, (which sendeth foorth praiers) is a sacrifice vnto God, Psal. 51. and therefore ought not to be offered to creatures; and Psal. 140. he desireth, that his praier may be as incense, &amp; the euening sacrifice, &amp;c.
               Concerning ceremonies, he chargeth me to refuse al, by mine argument of authoritie of Gods worde negatiuely, and yet in other wordes to allowe some. Who so will conferre the places, shall easily see his witlesse and senselesse cauelling. I refuse all superstitious and idolatrous ceremonies, but the word of God alloweth such as are necessarie for order and decencie, not hindering, but furthering edification. The order of seruice and ministration, which Iustinus describeth the Church to haue vsed, containeth a summe of all that we vse in our liturgie. Bristowe saith, it is the summe of the Masse also, and there is water mingled with wine, plaine against the Communion booke. As for the mingling of water with wine, howe proueth he, that it is named as a necessarie ceremonie vsed in that time, and not rather to declare,

how soberly the Christians vsed wine in those meetinges, which were so malitiously slaundered? But if it were a ceremonie, what hath it contrarie to the communion booke, which although it require no more then Christ vsed, yet it forbiddeth not the addition of water, if any necessarie occasion doe require it? But I would faine see the masse disciphered out of that description of Iustine, which Bristowe saith, is the verie summe of the masse. Vnlesse Fulke be so foolish to thinke, saith he, that the Bishoppes sermon, the receiuing of all present, the carying of it to them that be absent, the rich mens offering may not to be omitted in any masse, or for any cause. What so euer may be vsed or omitted at any masse, or for any cause, I am not so wise, that I knowe, nor so carefull that I desyre to knowe. But is Bristowe so madde, to make any indued with reason to thinke, that Iustinus describeth, that which was seldome or neuer vsed among them, rather then that which was vniformely obserued in all their meetinges?
               
                  But out of the scripture I reason affirmatiuely reiecting all the beggerly ceremonies of poperie, because God is to be worshipped in spirite &amp; truth, and yet in an other place, I admit som furniture: therefore (saith Bristowe,) that I haue misused this text, with much babbling to little purpose. Mine answere is, that although some external rites, are necessarie for order and decencie, yet the true and proper worshippe of God, is onely in spirite and veritie, and consisteth not in externall rites, no not when they are best vsed.
               Secondly, against popishe lessons, responses, versicles, lewde lyes and vncertaine tales, read and songe as Gods seruice: &amp;c. I alledged Mathewe, 15. In vaine doe they worship me &amp;c. Here he taxeth mine ignorance in the scripture saying, that the precepts of men are those which be of men and not of GOD. And are not lewde lyes, and vncertaine tales such? yea, all your vaine distinctions of popish seruice: for which you cannot shewe any one commaundement of GOD, nor allowance of the Godly Church, but of

the synagogue of Sathan, which your beggerly Logike craueth in this aunswere, to be taken for the Catholike Church of Christ. After this he chargeth me, to falsifie the Councel of Laodicea cap. 59. when I say it decreed, That nothing should be song or read in the Church, but the Canonicall bookes of the holie Scripture. Vnto which accusation, I aunswere, that I gaue the summe of the Councel, truely and without any falsification. That nothing should be read in the Church beside the Canonicall bookes of the Scripture, which are there named, Bristowe confesseth, and the wordes of the Canon are plaine. This is sufficient to ouerthrowe Popish lessons, where of nine, most commonly not one is of the Scripture. But Bristowe will make three Councels of Carthage, ca. 47. to expound this Canon of Laodicea, where it is commaunded that nothing be read vnder the name of the diuine Scriptures, but only the Canonical Scriptures. If this exposition were allowed, yet Popish seruice is not discharged; for therein, the Machabees and other Apocryphall Scriptures, which the Councel of Laodicea doth reiect, are read as the diuine Scriptures. And as for matters to be soung, the Councel reiecting Psalmes made by vnskilfull persons, meaneth to admit none but either the Psalmes and Hymnes of the Scripture, or at least, such as are consonant vnto them: and therefore would neuer haue admitted that blasphemous versicle, or what the diuel so euer you call it: Tu per Thomae sanguinem quem pro te impendit, Fac nos, Christe, scandere, quò Thomas ascendit. By the bloud of Thomas which for thee he did spend, Make vs, Christ, to climbe whither Thomas did ascend. Nor a great number of such, not onely vnlearned songs, but wicked and hereticall ditties, that are contained in your Popish portuise.
               Where I said, the festiuall daies were kept of the primitiue Church, not in honour of the Saints, as they are of the Papistes, but only for the memorie of the Martyrs, &amp;c. to imitation: Bristowe opposeth a saying of Augustine, which to imitation addeth consociation to the merites, and aide of their praiers. Cont. Faust. lib. 20. cap. 21. As

for fellowship of their worthinesse, is the fruit of imitation, the helpe of their praiers, is a smacke of that declining time, which Bristowe alwaies obtrudeth to vs, as the onely primitiue Church, which I vnderstand for the first Church of the Apostles, and that which was most auncient next vnto them.
               Where I cite out of Augustine, de ver. rel. cap. 55. that Saints and Angels were of Christians in his time honoured, with loue, not with seruice; for imitation, not for religion: First Bristowe asketh, whether he doth not expressely here auouch their honouring? Yes verily, and as expressely he denieth that they are to be honoured with seruice of religion. But seruitus with Bristowe, is not the Latine of the Greeke word Dulia, it is but mine vnacquaintance is Saint Augustines writings. If mine acquaintance in S. Augustines writings, were as smal as his skill is in the Greeke language, I might be accounted a great straunger in them. But let vs heare what Bristowes familiaritie with Saint Augustine hath found of the signification of Dulia. 
                  
                     
                        De ciuit. Dei. lib. 10. cap. 1. Latriam quippe nostri vbicunque &amp;c. Where so euer in the holie Scriptures, is put Latria, our interpreters haue translated it seruitus &amp;c.
                   verie well: therefore the olde Latine interpreters iudged Latria and Doulia to be all one. For euen so haue they translated Doulia, alwaies by the word seruitus. as Exod 6. 13 20. Rom. 8. Gal. 4. 5. Heb. 2. Wherefore Saint Augustine not finding a proper Latine worde, to expresse the worship of God, and chosing Latria the Greeke word, doth onely shewe howe it was his pleasure to vse the terme, and not what the worde doth properly signifie. For 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   differeth not from 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in signification, as euen Suidas doth confesse, although he say that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is a seruice, (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,) for wages. And therefore like a learned Grecian, Bristowe, saith 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is synonomum to 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , whereas 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is neuer vsed but for worship of GOD, or superstition, or religion: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is a generall name for any kinde of seruice due either to GOD or men. But what shall I reason with such a blocke, as challengeth all authenticall seruice, that euer hath

bene in any Church to be the Popish seruice, although it differ from it both in forme and matter, euen as before he saide, that Iustines description is the verie summe of the Masse.
               Concerning the tongue in which the seruice is, Bristowe saith, it maketh no difference in the seruice it selfe: but because I holde that it ought to be in the vulgar tongues, he will consider my groundes thereof. First, the fourteenth of the first to the Corinthians, proueth it not, because he speaketh there of a miraculous gift of tongues. A strong reason, I promise you, nay much rather if a speciall gift of the holie Ghoste, must giue place to the edifying of the Church, much rather an vnknowne tongue, superstitiously vsurped, must be abolished.
               Secondly he saith, Saint Paule doth not reiect the gift, but moderate it, for the varietie of certaine, much like to some Protestantes, that thinke all learning to be the tongues, and quoteth Pur. 7. It was not meete, that Saint Paule should reiect a gift of the holie Ghost, but shewe the right vse of it. But where Bristowe noteth me to thinke all learning to be the tongues, and quoteth the place, he sheweth him selfe to bee a shamelesse lier: for although I exemplifie such learning, as is most necessarie for the vnderstanding of the Scriptures, by knowledge of tongues and rationall sciences: yet it followeth not, that I thinke all learning; or all learning needefull for that purpose, to be knowledge of the tongues and rationall sciences, much lesse to be the onely knowledge of the tongues, as this proude Asse ignorant in the tongues, and almost in all good learning, without all foreheade, or with an yron or brasen face, doeth lewdly belie me. But if any man thinke (saith Bristowe) that one may argue of that Chapiter a simili: Let him consider, first, that so, the manner of simple Catholikes, who praie to them selues priuately in the Latine tongue, which they vnderstande not, is not condemned, but iustified. A harde matter, to iustifie superstitious ignoraunce, by similitude

of the heauenly giftes of Gods spirite, which is the spirite of trueth and knowledge. Yes, saith Bristowe, he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not to men but to God. Yea sir, but doth he say, he that speaketh in a tongue which he vnderstandeth not him selfe? Againe the Apostle saith, he that speaketh in a tongue, doeth edifie him selfe: Verily he that speaketh in a tongue, which he vnderstandeth no more then a Parot, edifieth not him selfe, nor any other. Againe he saith: if I pray in a tongue, my spirite praieth, but my vnderstanding or minde is vnfruitfull: which wordes Bristowe hath impudently falsified, saying, For if I praie in a tongue, my spirite (or affection) praieth, though my vnderstanding be without fruite. Where not onely hee taketh spirite for a blinde affection, which is meant of a spirituall gift, but also would beare vs in hande, that Saint Paule iustified praier with affection voide of vnderstanding, where it followeth immediatly, that he will him selfe, and exhorte all other to pray, not onely in spirit, or spirituall gift, but also with mind or vnderstanding, which shall be fruitfull vnto other. But he saith further, as Bristow maketh him to say, If thou blesse or giue thanks in spirit, thou doest it well: Where neither his wordes, nor meaning is such, but speaketh of them which vse that spirituall gift of tongues, to expresse godlie praier or thankesgiuing, which serue not to edifie the congregation, but doth not iustifie that what so euer a man shall speake in praier or thankesgiuing with affection, is well spoken, although the speaker vnderstand not what he say. For howe can he blesse or giue thankes well, that knoweth not whether he blesse or cursse, in the wordes which he vttereth, with neuer so good affection? Lastly, hee citeth out of Saint Paule: If there bee no interpreter, let him be silent in the Church, and speake to him selfe and to GOD. And hereof Bristowe will-conclude, that mother B. is iustified to say her Aui Mari, Daminus stickum &amp;c. As though he that spake in such a tongue as no man present could interprete, and he him selfe that spake

it, did not vnderstand what he spake: but spake meerely in the aire.
               The second thing that Bristowe would haue to be considered, is that the Church in her publike prayers, doth not speake in a tongue, because the Latine tongue is not in England a straunge tongue, so as it were if one should say Masse at Rome in the English tongue. And whie so I pray thee, Bristowe? Because in England heere and there one, vnderstandeth the Latine tongue? Verily in Rome there be some also that vnderstand the English tongue. Thinke you Bristowe could haue this consideration without his considering cap? and therevpon concludeth, And so the question is not nowe the same as was betweene the Apostle and the Corinthians: But whereas the Church would doe all thinges for edification, the question is, whether this be obtained in the publike prayers of the whole world, rather by the Latine tongue, that is to say, by the common tongue, or else by the seuerall tongues, that is to say, by the priuate tongues. Whie, howe nowe Bristowe? is the Latine tongue the common tongue of the whole worlde? You that haue all learning beside the tongues, will you denie all other tongues to be common, but the Latine? But to let that passe, the Catholikes haue one aunswere to this question, drawing all 
                        •
                     o common or vnitie, with a little helpe you may by the same corde, drawe in the communitie and vnitie of Plato and the Anabaptistes: but in the meane while, your edification is voide of instruction. But that is a small matter with you, to driue all men into a common heape of ignorance and superstition, which is your drawing all to common or vnitie.
               But to come to examples of the primitiue Church, he saith I can not denie, but that all nations of the Latine Church, had the seruice in Latine: I say, all nations that vnderstoode the Latine tongue, as their vulgar speach, but not all nations of the West, which vnderstoode it not. That most nations vnderstoode the Latine tongue, which he calleth an absurde position, he saith I proue it, by the Germane or French Councels of Toures, Magunce, and Rhemes, by which I rather

shewe the decaie of the Latine tongue in those regions. But my proues are other then he is able to aunswere, and therefore he letteth them passe, cauelling that the Latine tongue was hard vnto the people, where I shewe the decaie of it: As also that the French tongue at this day is in some places called the Romane, where I shewe the continuaunce of the rusticall Romane tongue in Fraunce, out of the Councel of Turon 3. cap. 17. as though the French tongue at this day, were not much declined from the similitude which it had with the pure Latine tongue, seuen or eight hundreth yeares agoe. To the decree of the Councel of Laterane cap. 9. which commaunded, that Ministers should be prouided, which according to the diuersitie of rites and languages, should celebrate diuine seruice, and minister the sacraments, to people of diuers languages, being conuersant in one citie. Bristowe aunswereth, the Bishoppes were not commaunded to translate the seruice into English, and other vulgar tongues, but to prouide Ministers according to the rites and languages in which the seruice presently was. Yes sir, they were commaunded to prouide Ministers to serue them according to the diuersitie of languages, that were in euerie citie, where were people of diuers tongues. But otherwise Bristowe asketh me, whie it prouideth for those cities and diocesses in which were people of diuers languages, and not for all in generall. I aunswere the prouision is generall, according to the diuersitie of languages in any citie or diocesse. Last of all, he asketh whie suche translation was in no place put in execution? But first I must aske him howe he proueth that in no place it was put in execution? And although it were not, it declareth the negligence of the Bishops, not the vnderstanding of the Canon.
               In the foure and twentie Demaund of Priesthoode and sacrifice, he chargeth vs with apostasie, for translation of the Priesthoode, whereof must followe a translation of the lawe. Which apostasie falleth right vpon

the Papistes, which translated the Priesthoode of Christ which he hath 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   without succession, vnto their blasphemous sacrificing Priesthood. But let vs see what balde reason he bringeth, to proue that we haue translated the Priesthood. First we haue laboured to chaunge the Apostolicall names of Episcopus and Presbyter, into superintendent &amp; elder. So a translation out of Greeke into Latine, or English, is a chaunge with him: and such as may not be abidden, for he reproueth me for translating Presbyterum in Cyprian, an elder.
               Secondly, I helpe an other argument of theirs, concluding out of Ephes. 4. that the Popish Hierarchie is no part of Christian Ministerie: by which I declare, that we haue chaunged the Priesthoode of the Primitiue Church, which had Popish Bishops, Priestes, Deacons, Subdeacons, Exorcistes, Cantors, Acolytes, Ostiaries, for which he citeth Eusebius lib. 6. cap. 34. where there is no such matter named, either in the Greeke or Latine computation of Grynaeus. I confesse the names are auncient, and the offices in the Primitiue Church, were some necessarie, some profitable, but I speake of the Popish Hierarchie, in which nothing remaineth but the names. But Bristowe thinketh I do not consider, that S. Paule nameth there, the onely Ministers of the worde or preachers. Yes verily: and therfore I exclude all these Popish orders, which are such euery one of them as may be and are giuen to men, that are no preachers or ministers of the word. As for the order of Christian Deacons, for ministring to the poore, and Elders of gouernement, I knowe they are not to be sought in that rehearsall. But for those Popish orders that Bristow saith, belong to the ministerie of the altar, ye Scripture speaketh no one word of them. Yet he saith, I may see the distinction of them, Act. 13. where some preachers had not orders, &amp; 1. Tim. 3. where some good Priestes do not labour in the word and doctrine. Concerning the first place, I knowe not what he meaneth, except he thinke Paule and Barnabas were not Apostles, before handes were laid on them, and they dismissed to preach abroad among the Gentiles. Or else,

that those Prophetes and teachers named in the beginning of the Chapter, had nowe orders, which howe he proueth I maruell, specially seeing other Papistes doe vnderstand the worde 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which signifieth ministring, for their sacrificing.
               As for the other place is of Elders of gouernement, and not Priestes of the Altar. That the auncient writers vsed the names of Sacerdotes, Leuitae, Pontifices, it was not because the ministers of the Gospell are a species or kinde of them, but abusiuely, for a certaine similitude of the Leuiticall order and Priesthoode, with the ministers of the word and sacraments.
               Thirdly he saith, the Apostles, Bishops, and Priestes, were made by other Bishops and Priestes; ours by Lay men, as of Kings and ciuile Magistrates, which is an impudent slaunder.
               Fourthly, wee confesse their orders to bee good ynough, because we reorder not them, which is false: for I saide, their admission of the Church is a newe calling. Bristowe saith, that is a newe way to giue orders, shewing him selfe ignorant, that euen in the olde Church, suche as were ordained by some heretikes, were receiued after they had abiured their heresie, to continue in the degree of the Cleargie, as of the Nouatians, Concil. Nicen. cap. 8. Wherefore the rest of his babbling, O your Diuinitie, O your Scripture, as that I bring nothing to defend Pilkington, not to be a mocke Bishop, but his excellent learning and diligent preaching &amp;c. I passe ouer, as also the great preaching, which nowe at the last, is in Popish countries, where within these threescore yeares, was as great silence as in England at the same time.
               Fiftly, arguments neede not, where I denie all Priesthoode, but the spirituall Priesthoode common to all Christians.
               Sixtly, If I will inuent a thirde Priesthoode, hee saith that the Primitiue or Fathers Priesthoode was according to the order of Melchisedech, and to offer sacrifice in breade
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  and wine as Melchisedek &amp; Christ did. Beware what you say, of a sacrifice of bread and wine offered by you &amp; Christ, as by Melchisedek: But you regarde not our arguments, they be but obiections. At leastwise I pray you answere our obiections, or else they wilbe argumentes to proue you all blasphemous vsurpers of Christs singular priesthood. But that you wil doe at leasure, &amp; first you will proue your priesthood out of Augustine, Contr. aduers. Leg. &amp; Prophet. Lib. Cap. 19 &amp; 20. Where he defendeth the sacrifice of the Church to be after the order of Melchisedek, and yet but a sacrifice of praise. So that you haue neither your sacrifice propitiatorie, whereof the controuersie is, nor your particular priesthood, for he saith: The Church from the Apostles time &amp;c. doth offer to God in the body of Christ a sacrifice of praise &amp;c. not after the order of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedeck. Now who knoweth not, that the sacrifice of praise, is a spiritual sacrifice, common to al the Church, and not peculiar to any special order of priesthood? So that S. Augastine naming ye order of Melchisedek, alludeth to those places of the scripture, in which all Christians are called a royall priesthood, &amp; Kinges and priestes 1. Pet. 2. Apoc. 1. but neuer intended to make the singular priesthood of Christ, confirmed to him by oath, Psalm. 110. and which passeth not from him, Heb. 7. common to ministers of the Church. If you obiect, He speaketh of celebration of the sacrament which is peculiar to them: I answere although the ministration of the sacrament be proper vnto them, yet the sacrifice of praise offered in the celebration, is common to the whole Church, as Augustine both here and else where affirmeth. So that although a sacrifice be graunted, yet a special priesthood is not proued. But the sacrifice of the crosse was both of thankesgiuing, &amp; of propitiatiō, he troweth: and therfore the memoriall sacrifice of the altar to be the one, what doth it let to be the other? This argument standing vpon Bristowes trowing, and confounding the members of a diuision, shall haue none other answere for me. The places that I cite out of Ambrose, ad virg. laps. &amp; de

virgin. Lib. 1. to proue that he vseth the names of sacrifice and propitiation, vnproperly, as other of the fathers doe, Bristow will not allow as sufficient, saying I might as wel so argue, that S. Paule speaketh vnproperly, because he saith our bodies by mortification to be made a liuing sacrifice. whereas the Apostle, Heb. 10. saith Christs body by death to be made a sacrifice. And what offence is it to say S. Paule speaketh vnproperly, where he speaketh figuratiuely? as when he saith the rock was Christ. Howbeit in this example of Bristow, there is great difference, but that such a blunderer as he cannot see it, which confoundeth the propitiatorie sacrifice of Christ, with the eucharisticall sacrifice of Christians, as he confounded them both in the sacrifice of the Crosse: the one could not be offered, without death of the sacrifice and sacrificer, the other is offered continually, the sacrificer liuing.
               As for his rule to know proper and vnproper speaches, let him trie to teach his pupils: when I am disposed to learne, I will chuse a better learned teacher.
               But now he cōmeth to answere obiections. First I sayd the bringing foorth of bread and wine, was no part of Melchisedeks priesthood, seeing the Apostle comparing him with Christ, in all thinges in which he was comparable, neuer teacheth it, as any part of his priesthood. This argument Bristow maketh to be of one place of Scripture negatiuely, not consideting it is the onely place, where such comparison is made, and that it is absurd to thinke, the Apostle would omit so principall a part of Melchisedeks and Christs priesthood. But Bristow will examine the text. First their vulgar translation, begining at proferens, both gelding the text, &amp; falsely translating At verò Melchisedek rex Salem, proferens panem &amp; vinum (erat enim sacerdos dei altissimi) benedixit ei, &amp;c. But truly Melchisedek King of Salem, bringing foorth bread and wine (for he was the priest of the highest GOD) blessed him saying. What doth this context helpe him, which is as much to say as he blessed him because he was a priest? Bristow,

fraudulently omitteth the parenthesis, and in translation, changeth the participle into the verbe. But in the Hebrue (If we beleeue Bristowe) the poynting declareth, that also the Rabbines themselues take it in the same sort. What a greate Rabbine is Bristowe sodenly growne to be, since his departure out of Oxforde? But what poynting should declare this, he sheweth not, neither can I gesse. The text is: And Melchisedek King of Salem brought foorth bread and wine: there is the middle of the verse: then it followeth: And he was a Priest, of the highe GOD, there is the end: then it followeth, And he blessed him &amp;c. In deede Rabby Salomon, but not in respect of any poynting sayth of the bringing foorth of bread and wine, for a true exposition, First that it was vsuall to doe so to men, that were wearied in warre: also that thereby he shewed, that he was not offended with him for killing of his Children, for he taketh Melchisedek to be Sem, the middle sonne of Noach: Secondly for a Mideash, or vaine exposition, that it was to signifie the Minchoth and Nesecuth the meat offeringes, and the drinke offeringes, which his children or posteritie, should offer in that place, not that Melchisedek in respecte that he was a Prieste, did bring foorth bread and wine. But all the Fathers doe agree in this similitude of Melchisedeches Priesthood with CHRIST. I knowe that many doe so, but one Apostle is of greater authoritie then they all, yet none of them all speaketh of a Priesthoode, to offer vp the naturall bodie of Christ in a propitiatorie sacrifice, which is the principall matter in question.
               But if Melchisedek were a Prieste, Bristowe will aske me, what was his sacrifice, if it were not bread and wine, seeing none other is mentioned?
               For my part, I am not ashamed to be ignorant of that, which the Holy Ghost hath not reueiled. Sure I am, if bread and wine had beene his sacrifice, and the sacrifice of Christ also: the Apostle would not haue omitted it, which compareth much

smaler matters in him, with Christ then that.
               Where I say, it is horrible blasphemie, to challenge the Priesthoode according to the order of Melchisedek, which is singular to Christ: Psalm. 110. and Heb. 7. Bristowe asketh, if the scripture say not, that there is one baptizer which is Christ, and yet all are not blasphemers that are baptisers. I answere, if any take vpon him to baptise, with ye holy ghost and with fire, he is an horrible blasphemer. But to baptise with water, that is to be ministers of the outwarde sacrament, in which onely Christ baptiseth inwardly, Christ hath called all those ministers of his word and sacramentes. Shewe you the like calling for your blasphemous Priesthood, after the order of Melchisedek, or else your example of baptisers will not discharge you of horrible blasphemie. But you haue another docterlike argument, when you haue scoffed out my poore doctershippe. Were not all the rest in the olde time the ministers of Aaron, but Aaron himselfe was Priest onely in his owne time, and after him euerie one in his time was Priest as well as he, and therefore in that law were many Priestes. He asketh the question, as though it were out of question. Were not all. &amp;c. O famous and illuminate doctor, where did your docters hoode learne, that all the high Priestes successiuely, (whereof euerie one was a figure of Christ as much as Aaron) were ministers of Aaron? For you speake of high Priestes, or else what meane you to say, that Aaron him selfe was priest onely in his owne time, for all his sonnes were priests, although he onely the high priest in his time. Vpon this stronge foundation, you build a similitude and dissimilitude. So that the olde testament was like to England since the conquest, hauing successiuely many Kinges, But the newe testament is like to England duduring the time of one King: who being but one, yet hath many ministers, as one might say so many ministerial kinges. You shew learning ynough in this similitude and dissimilitude to make you a doctor after ye popes order. But let vs vnder correctiō of your doctors hood, examine your cōparisō.

The olde Testament was like England since the Conquest, hauing successiuely many Kings. Had not euerie of those kings, many Ministers vnder them? And euerie Aaronicall priest had also many Priestes and Leuites vnder him? And was not Christ head of the Church of the Iewes, in the seuerall times of euery the high Priest? Wherefore the olde testament is as like to England during the time of one King, as the newe in those pointes, but the difference is this: that the figuratiue high priestes were many, because they could not continue, but by death were alwaies chaunged: Christ being an euerlasting Priest, hath a priesthoode that descendeth not by succession: so that although he haue many ministers, yet he onely hath the euerlasting priesthoode, which is according to the order of Melchisedek, Heb. 7. As for your terme of ministeriall kings, howe well it agreeth to your shauen crownes, I will not stand here to discusse.
               My third argument, as Bristowe calleth it, is this: The Apostle to the Hebrues cap. 10. teacheth vs, that Christ offering but one sacrifice for our sinnes (and that but once cap. 9.) hath made perfect for euer those that are sanctified: that our sinnes are taken away by that sacrifice, and therefore there is no more sacrifice for sinnes left. To this Bris
                     •
                  owe aunswereth, that I doe not vnderstand, what the Apostle meaneth by those that are sanctified; by their making perfect; by sacrifice for sinne. The sanctified are onely the newe baptized by his iudgement, for which he quoteth 1. Cor 6. where the Apostle saith: But nowe you are washed, you are sanctified, you are iustified, by the name of our Lord Iesus, and by the spirit of our God. By which he plainely sheweth, that although they were baptized long before, and had committed many sinnes sithence their baptisme, yet the cleannesse of their washing, the holinesse of their sanctification, the righteousnesse of their iustification, they retained still, and therefore exhorteth them to keepe it to the end. So that while Bristowe (as he doth alwaies) chargeth me with ignorance, not knowing what is meant by their making perfect: he incurreth great forgetfulnesse, euen of ye Apostles words where he expoūdeth, which are

not onely, he hath made perfect, but, he hath made perfect for euer, them that are sanctified. So that if sanctification were restrained to baptisme, which no logike can proue, yet it followeth, that they which are sanctified by Christes death in baptisme, are made perfect not for a moment, as these obstinate blinde Papistes teach, from which perfection they fall immediatlie, and must recouer it by masses, and as Bristowe saith, by penance, &amp;c. But Christ by that one sacrifice but once offered, hath made perfect for euer, all those that are sanctified. That the purpose of the Apostle (in all that Epistle to the Hebrewes) was no more but to exhort the standing to perseuerance, as Bristowe in so many wordes affirmeth, let him beleeue, that can thinke, the greatest part of his disputation, for the abolishing of all ceremonies, and sacrifices of the lawe, to be idle and beside his purpose. Likewise that if they fall, he telleth them that Christes death will not worke in them an other baptisme, but remedie he telleth them none. Verily there is no remedie, for them that make the death of Christ of none effect vnto themseues, by an vtter and vniuersall fall from CHRIST. But it is an horrible slaunder of Gods spirite, that he telleth no remedie by repentance, from particular faulles and daylie offences: when he sheweth the perpetuall clensing of our conscience by the bloode of Christ, Hebrews, 10. verse, 14. and in the 12. Chapter he hath many and earnest exhortations to repentance, verse, 1. and 12. shewing the necessitie of Gods fatherly correction to bring vs to repentance, Verses 5. 6. 7. &amp;c. But I shewe great ignorance, where I conclude, that if the greatest parte be left to the sacrifice of the masse, namely to take away all sinnes committed since baptisme, Christ hath not made them that are sanctified perfect for euer by a sacrifice once offered for all. For Papistes deuide not remission of a mans sinnes betwene baptisme and the masse. No: but you ascribe the whole in such sorte to either of both, that you diuide the powre of making perfect for euer, from the onely once offered sacrifice of

Christ. But you thinke it is highly for the honor of that one high Priest to haue many ministers, and many ministeries, as it were conduites to deriue his purchase, &amp; his redemption to his people. In deede, if he had not one spirite that were of power to apply the grace of his redemption vnto all his elect, he had neede of many conduites, such as you speake of, for which purpose he vseth not the ministerie of man, but the vertue of the Holie Ghost. The ministerie of man is such as man can execute, that is by the worde, audible and visible, to speake to the eares and eyes of men, and beeing 
                     ••
                  i
                     •
                  
                  red vp by the holy spirite, to commende the whole effect of his word to the grace of God. But you thinke to auoyde exclamation, if you ascribe nothing to any man, nor any thing, but from that Priest, and from that sacrifice: as though it were lawfull for you to take any thing from the Prieste and sacrifice, and bestowe it vpon any man or thing, without commission: yea, against commaundement, and against the excellencie of perfection of that singular Priest and singular sacrifice, which being once offered neede, noe more to be repeated.
               The scriptures thus examined, he commeth to the doctors: And first to Augustine, or rather Fulgentius, de fide ad Petrum. cap. 19. cited by me Pur. 316. &amp; 292. to proue that the olde doctors, vsinge the name of sacrifice, ment not the popish sacrifice propitiatorie of the naturall bodie and bloode of of Christ, because he calleth it Sacrificium panis &amp; vini, the sacrifice of bread and wine. Bristowe replieth, that he also calleth it the the sacrifice of the body &amp; bloode of Christ, wherein as it is cited by him, so is it answered by me, cap. 6. of this booke. Secondly where he saith, In this sacrifice is thankesgiuing &amp; commemoration &amp;c. Bristow replieth, that he saith also that in this sacrifice is euidētly shewed, what is giuen for vs, &amp; he is announced alreadie killed. But because this is nothing to ye purpose, he compareth it to ye martyrdomes of Peter &amp; Paule commemorated vpon their feast at Rome euidently shewed and announced by their verie bodies and heades

there seene and visited. A newe way to vnderstand olde doctors, by practise of Idolatrous iugling and faining of reliques. If these Apostles by their bodies be whole at Rome, so many Churches of Peter and Paule as haue presently, or haue had in times past, reliques of their bones, were greatly deceiued. For notwithstanding that Petres whole head is at Rome, his nether iawe, with his bearde is at Poyters, and many of both their bones at Triers, Saint Paules shoulder at Argentina: yea a peece of Saint Peters braine was at Geneua, where it was tried to be a good pumice stone.
               The second doctor is, August. de ciui. dei, lib. 22. cap. 10. saying, the martyrs are that body, which is offered in sacrifice, whereof I conclude, that it is not the naturall body of Christ, but his mysticall body, which is offered in a sacrifice of thankesgiuing. Bristowe answereth, that the mysticall body is offered in the offering of the natu
                     •
                  ll body. But Augustine neuer saith, that the naturall body of Christ is offered, but expressing what body is offered, sheweth that the mysticall body is offered. Neuerthelesse Bristowe compareth it to the oblation of Christes naturall body, in offering whereof for his Church, he offered his Church to God with it. But how proueth he yt Christ offered his Church to God for a sacrifice? The sacrifice of himselfe was propitiatorie for the sinnes of his Church, which before he had purged by his sacrifice, he could not offer as a cleane and acceptable sacrifice vnto God.
               The third doctor is, Tertullian, which saith, that prayer is the greatest sacrifice that God hath commanded. Bristow saith, That in the name of that prayer, he comprehendeth all that is saide and done in the masse, which to this day the priest therfore begineth saying vnto vs after the gospell, Dominus vobiscū, oremus, let vs pray, &amp; immediatly goeth to the bread and wine &amp;c. You may thinke I iest: they be the very, words of Bristow and his onely answere. Yea, but there be reasons of this saying: Because that pure sacrifice is made &amp; celebrated with prayer, as Hierom saith, by the p
                        •
                     iestes prayers.
                  
What are then the wordes of consecration? And because euen the olde howse of those leuiticall bloode sacrifices also, was Domus orationis, the howse of prayer: Therefore the masse is nothing but a prayer. So is Tertullian answered. Who would not wonder at this clearkely answere? For I thinke no man can vnderstand of what reason it holdeth.
               The last doctor is Irenaeus saying of the sacrifice of the Church, 
                     Libr. 4. cap. 34. The conscience of him that doth offer being pure, doth sanctifie the sacrifice, and causeth GOD to accepte it as comming from a frende. The sacrifices doe not sanctifie a man, for GOD hath no neede of sacrifice. &amp;c. This cannot be verified of the naturall body of Christ. Bristowe answereth, they say the same. Yea doe, Bristowe? Is the sacrifice you offer, the bodie of Christ? Yea? doth the conscience of the offerer, sanctifie the body of Christ? Out vpon thee filthie blasphemous dogge, if thou dare affirme it. But Bristow asketh Wether any heretike canpleade by their verdit, that he pleaseth God in offering to him bread and wine? As though that were the question. Yea or also the body it selfe and bloode of Christ, so as all Priestes doe in their Caluinicall communion, no lesse then we doe in the masse? What newes is this? doe all Priestes in the Caluinicall communion, offer the body and blood of Christ as much as you papistes doe in your masse? I thinke euen the same: for none that communicate with Caluine, doe at all offer Christes naturall body and blood, and no more doe you, although arrogantly and blasphemously you presume to doe it.
               In the 25. demaund of Monkes, where I say the olde Monkes were nothing but Colledges of studentes: Bristowe saith, in ouerthtowing of Popish Abbeis, in which was nothing almost but ignorance and filthmes, and Idolatrie, we haue spoyled the Church of God, of great vtilitie. But he saith further, they were votaries, and so they be not in colledges of studentes: their vowes were not such that could make them other then students, they

vowed to serue God vprightly, and his Church, when they were called, and they in Colledges which hauing once promised the same, forsake this holie purpose, haue smale commendation among studentes. I know in time superstition preuailed, and that which first was free, at last became coact: and that which was of conueencie, was thought of necessitie, euen as true religion declined, and in the Romish Church at length degenerated into Idolatrie and superstition.
               In the 27. demaund of Councels, where I proue that Councels may erre. First by the prayer vsually saide after the ende of euerie generall Councel: Bristowe saith, the prayer is not in respect, for any false decrees or beleeuings of their whole bodies, but by reason of certaine ignorances and frailties of their members: when in the prayer, they expresly declare their feare, lest ignorance hath driuen them into error, which can be vnderstoode of none other common errors of this life, but of their error in decrees, seeing the prayer is appropriate vnto the Councel. And that the wordes going before, &amp; after do manifestly declare. 
                     Te in nostris principiis &amp;c. Thee in our beginninges we require an assister, thee also in this ende of our iudgementes or decrees, we desire to be present a pardoner for our faultes, that is, that thou wouldest spare our ignorance and pardon our error: that to our perfect desires, thou wouldest graunt a perfect efficacie of worke. And because our conscience accusing vs, we doe fainte for feare, lest either ignorance hath drawne vs into errror, or rashnes of will perhaps hath driuen vs to decline from iustice; therfore we desire thee, &amp; we pray thee, that if we haue drawne vnto vs, any offence in the celebritie of this Councell, thou wouldest vouchsafe to pardon it, and to make it remissible. Who would pray thus, in the name of the whole Councell, which he thought could not possiblie fall into any error.
               That I alledge out of Augustine, de baptismo contra Donat. libr. 2. cap. 3. That generall Councells are and may be reformed, the later by the former: Bristowe vnderstandeth

of Councells not confirmed by the Pope, which may be reformed euen by ye see Apostolike alone. That was a poynt more then S. Augustine sawe. But how can they be called Plenaria concilia full and whole Councells, where lacketh any necessarie confirmation? This is a shamelesse eluding of the Doctors sayinges. For first Augustine includeth all catholike Bishops, in possibility of erring in doctrine, not excepting the Bishop of Rome, then prouinciall, &amp; last of all generall Councells: onely the scripture cannot be amended, as that which hath no error in it.
               Where I saide, the Councells are receiued, because they decreed truly according to the worde of God, and not the truth receiued, because it was decreed in Councells: Bristowe saith, I might as well say, the scriptures are receiued, because they are written truly: and not the truth receiued because it is written in the scriptures. But I say the comparison is not like: For truth is not so necessarilie bound vnto generall Councells, as it is to the holy scriptures; and therefore both the scriptures are receiued because they are written truly, and the truth is receiued because it is knowne by the scriptures. It followeth not so of councells: that what soeuer they haue decreed is truth, although the Bishop of Rome haue confirmed them. Leo Bishop of Rome confirmed the 6. of Constantinople, which condemned Pope Honorius his predecessor for an heretike, whom you hould cannot erre in doctrine, which is an argument sufficient, to strangle any papist in either of these two blasphemous assertions: The pope cānot erre: The generall Councel confirmed by the Pope, cannot erre.
               In the 28. demaunde, of the See Apostolike, where I bring the example of Victor Bishop of Rome, withstoode by Irenaeus and Polycrates, when he went about to vsurpe authoritie ouer other Churches in excommunicating all the Churches in Asia, and yet Irenaeus and Polycrates with other so reprouing ye Bishop of Rome, were not heretikes: Bristow babling about the cause of Victors displeasure, which is no matter in question, saith

he vsurped no authoritie, nor was so charged, but that his censure did seeme to harpe to S. Irenaeus, as if the Pope would nowe excommunicate all them that would not receiue the Councel of Trent, it would seeme likewise to many, who confesse he hath authoritie ouer al. But none of these Bishops, that withstoode Victor, confessed, that he had authoritie ouer them, or that he could not erre. But contrariwise Polycrates chargeth him with vsurpation, where he saith he will not be troubled with his terrifying censure, seeing he followeth (as he thought) the scripture and ancient traditions of the Apostles. Likewise Eusebius saith, that Victor was sharply reproued of many, and namely of Irenaeus in the behalfe of all the brethren of Fraunce, whom he gouerned. Yea, he saith expresly, that Victor with his censure was countermanded, by many Bishops: 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . They did countermaund him, or gaue him contrarie commaundement, to set his minde on things pertaining to peace and vnitie, and loue of his neighbour. Irenaeus in his Epistle to Victor shewing, that Polycarpus could not be persuaded by Anicetus Bishop of Rome in some small things, wherein they differed, declared, that it was not then of Polycarpus or him selfe otherwise thought, but that the Bishop of Rome might erre.
               The other example, I brought, was of Stephanus Bishop of Rome, misliked by Dionysius: Euseb. lib. 7. cap. 2. 3. 4. 5 &amp;c. &amp; sharply reproued by Cyprian, accusing him of presumption and contumacie, Epist. ad Pomp. because he threatened excommunication to Hilenus and Firmilianus, and almost all the Churches of Asia, thinking that such as were baptized by heretikes, should be baptized againe. Also Cyprian in his Epist. ad Quirinum, saying that Peter himselfe was not so arrogant, nor so presumptuous, that he would say, he held the primacie, and yt other men should obey him, as his inferiors: Bristowe saith none of these denied ye primacie of Peter. I say they al denied the primacie of autoritie, although Cyprian in ye same place saith: For neither Peter, whom our lord chose first (which argueth no primacie but of order) vpō whom he builded

his Church, when Paule did afterward dissent from him, about circumcision, did boast him self or take vpon him any thing insolently or arrogantly, that he should say, he held the primacie, and that he ought rather to be obeyed of newe scholers and aftercommers. Here you see it had bene in Cyprians iudgement, a point of insolencie and arrogancie in Peter, if he had challenged the primacie of authoritie, and certaintie of trueth against al men. But Bristowe saith, when there was no remedie, but they must yeeld or be Schismatikes, because Stephanus would no longer tolerate them, they did like Catholike men, for all their Councels, conforme their newe practise to the old custome, and quoteth August. de bapt. cont. Donat. lib. 5. cap. 23. &amp; 25. where there is no such matter, also he referreth vs to his fift Demaund, where he citeth Euseb. lib. 7. cap. 2. 3. 4. 5. but neither is it there testified. Only cap. 6. Dionysius chaungeth his iudgement, being admonished in a vision, and that he had learned that not nowe onely, but of olde time, both in Aphrica and other places, the trueth was receiued, &amp;c. but of any constraint for feare of being Schismatikes, if they dissented from the bishop of Rome, there is no word.
               The place of Hierome ad Euagrium, which I cited Pur. 374. defending a custome of the whole Church, against a custome of the Church of Rome, Bristowe saith, doth not proue a Church, a rule of trueth, and Christianitie, without the bishop and Church of Rome, because Hierome saith, as also there I cite: Nec altera &amp;c. we must not thinke, that there is one Church of the citie of Rome, and an other of all the world, &amp;c. By which wordes, he sheweth, that the Church of Rome, if she will be a member of the Catholike Church, must conforme her selfe to the Church of all the world, and not the Church of all the world conforme her selfe to the Church of Rome.
               Where I say, we beleeue the Catholike Church, hath no chiefe gouernour on earth but Christ, vnto whome al power is giuen in heauen and earth: Bristowe obiecteth: suppose, that one Christian King or Emperour should reigne sometime, as farre as the Church reacheth. To this

impossible supposition, I aunswere, that one King should haue no more authoritie, than euerie King hath nowe. But Bristowe obiecteth, that Kings and Queenes be no more named among S. Paules officers, &amp;c. Ephes. 4. &amp; 1. Cor. 12. and therefore as a Puritane belike, I would pull them downe. In the motiue of Apes, he discharged me from being a Puritane, by his censure; but now he burdeneth me to be a Puritane so farre, that I should also be a traitour, as he and all his fellowes are. To his wise obiection I aunswere, that as Kings and Queenes are not named among Saint Paules officers, so they are no Ecclesiasticall, but ciuill Magistrates, and the Church may be without them, as it was many hundreth yeares. Yet when Kings and Queenes are Christians, they haue chiefe authoritie ouer persons and in causes Ecclesiasticall, as farre as the godlie Kings of Israel and Iuda had, Dauid, Solomon, Iehosophat, Ezechias, Iosias, &amp;c.
               
                  But Christ professing that all power is giuen him, Matthew 28. signifieth that with good authoritie, he might commit what authoritie he would, and therefore biddeth all his Apostles goe, teach, and baptize
                        •
                      and to one of them singularly, feede my lambes and my sheepe. No maruel, though my ignorance in the scriptures be often reproued, when such learned conclusions come from Bristowe. Christ saide to one, feede my lambes and sheepe, therefore he saide it singularly, and he hath vniuersall charge, and all his successors to. But for the Popes supremacie, the Apostle saith expresly, 1. Cor. 12. the heade (vnder Christ) can not say to the feete, you are not necessarie to me. But who taught you to foyst in your owne glosse, vnder Christ? when the Apostle speaketh of the members of a naturall bodie; wherevnto euerie seueral cōgregation and ye whole church also is like. If you seeke the head of euery seuerall congregation, you must looke to the chiefe gouernours thereof, but if you seeke the head of the whole Church, the scripture teacheth but one, which is Christ, for one head vnder another, in one whole body is monstrous. But you thinke perhaps, Christ as he is head of his Church, may say to the feete, he hath no neede of them, and therefore it must be vnderstoode of

an head vnder Christ, but then you must remember, that although Christ be most perfect in him selfe, yet as he vouchsafeth to take vpon him this office to be head of ye Church, he is not perfect without al his members, which is the singular comfort of Gods children, Ephe. 1. ver. last. But Saint Paule, Ephe. 4. as Bristowe saith, vnder the name of the Apostles includeth the successors of the Apostle S. Peter, whose see for that cause is called the Apostolike see in singular maner, and their decrees and actes esteemed of Apostolike authoritie in al antiquitie. This cause is a shameles and senseles lie, for no antiquitie, for 600. yeares after Christ so esteemed ye see, or the decrees therof. Again., what reason is it, yt Peters successors should be included, more thē the successors of the other Apostles, seeing this souereigntie of Peter, is not grounded vpon his Apostleship, but vpon his Bishoplike office, as Sander maintaineth? As for the principalitie of Apostleship, &amp; principalitie of the Apostles chaire, which he quoteth out of August. de bapt. Cont. Don. li. 2. ca. 1. &amp; epi. 162. haue often bene shewed to be vnsufficient, to make euery one of Peters successors equal with Peter in authoritie, or Peter him selfe superiour to the rest of the Apostles. And consequently there is no cause to thinke, that calamitie of the Greekes to be fallen vpon them for departing from that see.
               In the 29. Demaund of Traditions, where I charge Papistes out of Irenaeus lib. 3. 2. to be like to the Valentinians, which accused the scriptures of imperfection, saying, that they are ambiguous, and that the trueth can not be found in them, by such as knewe not the tradition, which was not deliuered by writing, but by worde of mouth, &amp;c. Bristowe answereth, that S. Irenee him selfe, as al Catholikes, will haue both scripture and tradition. Yea sir, but what tradition? any trueth of doctrine, conserued by tradition, which is not contained in the holie scriptures? nothing lesse. But appealeth to the testimonie of the Churches tradition, for confirmation of that which is taught in the scriptures. 
                     Hunc patrem &amp;c. This father of our Lorde Iesus Christ to be preached of the Churches, they that wil, may learne out of the scripture it selfe, and

vnderstand the Apostolike tradition of the Church, seeing the Epistle is auncienter than they which nowe teach falsely &amp;c. So that what so euer the Apostles deliuered, is contained in their writinges, and it is still an hereticall assertion to say, that all true doctrine is not deliuered by writing, but some by word of mouth.
               In the 34. Demaund of Authoritie, where I affirme, the order of the Apostles schoole, is first to heare the word of God preached, and then to beleeue, Rom. 10. reprouing Allen which commended his friend, that he first beleeued, and afterward sought to vnderstand: Bristowe obiecteth the authoritie of Augustine, lib Retr. 1. cap. 14. where he sheweth the cause, whie he did write his booke de vtilitate credendi to haue ben, for that the Manichees derided the discipline of the Catholike faith, that men were commaunded to beleeue not taught, by most certaine reason, what was true, whose slaunder Augustine confuteth in that booke, and not defendeth Bristowes preposterous order. As for examples of beleeuing Christ and his Apostles, without requiring a reason of their doctrine; howe vaine it is, I leaue to children to laugh at, seeing I speak not of reason, but of the word of God preached, which must needes goe before faith: Neither doth Augustine meane any otherwise in his booke de vtil. cred. cap. 13. where he saith: It is rightly appointed by the maiestie of the Catholike discipline, that faith before all things is persuaded to them which come to religion. But howe should faith be persuaded, but by the preaching of the word of God, without curious inquisition, according to the reason of man?
               Where I say, that Protestants wil be ruled by their superiors, so far as their superiors are ruled by the word of God: Bristow derideth their authoritie, who by our own confession may swarue from the truth of Gods word: as though the Popish superiors might not, or their supreme head, although beside so many blasphemous errors, as he holdeth, wherof ye controuersie is with ye Papistes, it haue not bene oft proued, yt diuers Popes haue bene condemned, euen by generall Councels for heretikes. Where I

saide the Greeke Church will be ruled by the Patriake of Constantinople, and the orientall Churches by their Patriarkes and Bishops. Bristowe saith, if I knewe the storie of the Florentine Councel, wherein the Patriarkes agreed with the Catholikes Church in all things, and yet could not reduce their countries from schisme, I would not so say. But I knewe that storie before Bristow knewe whether he would become a professed Papist or no. This consent is a forged paper, found in the hande of Ioseph the Patriarke, who died soudenly: but in no acte of that Councel any such submission or agreement in all things, appeareth, but the contrarie.
               Where I saide, that to beleeue the Catholike Church, is not to beleeue all and euery thing which the Catholike Church doth maintaine: Bristowe would haue me suppose, the Apostles had said, Credo. S. Romanam ecclesiam, and then asketh, howe I would haue construed it. Verily euen as I conster Credo ecclesiam Catholicam. And so would I conster Credo Sanctas scripturas Canonicas &amp;c. But if the Apostles would haue taught vs, to giue credite to the Church of Rome in all things, they would haue taught vs to say, Credo Romanae ecclesiae. And Credo scripturis Canonicis, duodecim Apostolis, quatuor Euangelistis, &amp;c. I giue credite to the holy scriptures, to the twelue Apostles, and to the foure Euangelistes. For Credo with an Accusatiue case, to signifie I giue credite, howe so euer you deride my grammatication, will not be admitted in the kingdome of Grammarians, except his holinesse will doe as much for that terme, as he is reported to haue done once for fiatur.
               
               In the 35. Demand of Vnitie, where I said, the Church may be called the house of peace, because there is in it peace and agreement in the chiefest articles of faith: Bristowe saith, by this reason, many olde heresies were with in the house of peace, because any one article be it of the chiefest or of the meanest, may breake peace, as that of quartadecimani, who disagreed onely in the day of Easter but that and such like disagrements in opinion, might be in the house of peace, as Irenaeus testifieth, if obstinate

contempt of generall order did not make a schisme, and of a schisme an heresie, as in the Donatistes. Otherwise difference in a ceremonie (as I said) maketh not diuision of faith: Bristowe saith, yes, if they holde their ceremonie necessarie. But then they holde it not as a ceremonie, or the Churches ceremonie vnlawfull. But that maketh not diuision. Polycarpus thought his ceremonie to be the right ceremonie, against Anicetus, yet he was not diuided from him, for he considered the errour in a ceremonie not to be of such importance, that it ought to breake the vnitie of the Church. And therefore he refused not to communicate with Anicetus, nor Anicetus with him. No more doe they among vs, that differ in opinion of ceremonies, except some fewe schismaticall heades, that are condemned of all men for their contention and stubbornesse.
               The difference of opinions betweene the Popish Diuines and Canonistes, Bristowe saith are such, as may be among Christians, as Augustine testifieth, Cont. Iul. lib 1. cap. 2. de bapt. Cont. Don. lib. 1. cap. 18. vntil a general Councel allowe some part for cleare and pure, but we will not allowe the authoritie of any generall Councel, if Bristowe may be beleeued: If we might haue a Christiā generall Councel for such matters, as are in controuersie among vs, I doubt not but we should agree, better then the Papistes which boast so much of vnitie. As for the contention of the Popes and Councels superioritie, remaineth still among you, notwithstanding the Florentine Councel, which you say most impudently, that I confesse to haue resolued the matter, when an other Councel, and an other Pope at the same time, determined against it.
               In the 36. Demand of Owners or Keepers of the scriptures, where I say the primitiue Church, which commendeth the scripture vnto vs, doth not condemne Luther or his doctrine for heresie: Bristowe saith, it doth in Aerius, Iouinian, Vigilantius, &amp;c. as though there were no primitiue Church before these men, which commended the scripture vnto vs, and yet knewe neither praier for

for the deade, nor superstition of reliques, or any thing that Luther held with those men.
               Where I taxe the blindnesse of the Popish Church, not discerning the scriptures Canonicall, from Apocryphall: Bristowe bringeth in a saying of Augustine, shewing that it is of necessitie, for him to beleeue the Actes of the Apostles, if he beleeue the Gospell: because the Catholike authoritie commendeth both the scriptures alike vnto him. But I haue shewed, that the Maccabees, Ecclesiasticus, Iudeth, &amp;c. are not commended to vs by the Catholike or vniuersall authoritie of the Church. After other contentious pointes stoutly affirmed or denied, without proofe, he commeth to charge me with a substantiall lie, because I say our Church which is the onely true Catholike Church, hath alwaies had right and possion of the worde of God, as appeareth by this, that our Church beleueth nothing but that she learneth in them. If this be not a notable plea, Bristowe reporteth him to our Lawiers. But I report me to al Logicians, whether it be not a good argument, by prouing vs to be the true Church, to claime continuall right and possession of the scriptures, as for ye noueltie of Luther, &amp; our cōgregatiō, is a weake plea to dispossesse vs of ye Church, when y• antiquitie of our faith and religion, proueth vs to be of the oldest Church, and therefore the only true Church.
               Where Allen made his offer, that if I could shewe any Church, that hath safely kept the scriptures, sauing the Popish Church, he would recant: I shew him the Greeke and Easterne Churches, which are not Popish, whervpon he is bound by his offer to recant: yet Bristowe without all shame saith: Euery article of D. Allens is not to proue absolutely, that we be the Church; but some only that you be not the Church. True it is, that neither euery one nor any of them all, are sufficient to proue, that you are the Church and not we. But that Allen meant they were sufficient, it is manifest by that he promiseth to recant, if any of them can be proued to agree to any other, than to the Popish Church.
               
                  
In the eight and thirtie Demand of old Heresies, where I shewed that many of the Popish ceremonies, were first instituted by heretikes, aunswering directly to Allens challenge, that offered to recant if any man could proue, that any Church but theirs had instituted all their ceremonies: Bristowe saith they are such matters, as agree none otherwise to them then to those whome I dare not condemne &amp;c. Which if it were so, yet doth it not shewe but that I haue aunswered Allens challenge, and therefore do, according to his promise, claime his recantation.
               Of the Messalians or Martyrians I saide, they learned first to shaue their beardes, and let their lockes growe long: Bristowe out of Epiphanius saith, they did let their haire growe long like women The Popish Priestes doe not so, but round them. Yet can he not proue out of Epiphanius, that the Messalians did not keepe their haire in order by rounding or otherwise. Further he saith, some Protestants doe so. I aunswere, none of ceremonie doth so. Thirdly, Priestes in Italie and Spaine doe poll their heads and keepe their beardes. I answere, they keepe the text of the decree, and you the glosse, which saith, statuimus, id est abrogamus &amp;c. We decree, that is we abrogate that Clearkes neither weare long haire, nor shaue their beardes. Last of all he saith, I haue no great matters to charge them with, when I lay their haires to their charge. My reply is, that my charge goeth no further then Allens challenge, which vrgeth me to shewe any other to haue first instituted any one ceremonie in Poperie, but the Popes only Catholike Church. And so I say to the superstitious masking garmentes, instituted by the Pharisees, although the auncient Church about foure or fiue hundreth yeares after Christe, receiued such robes in vse.
               Also the daily vse of Popish holie water, to put men in minde of baptisme, had an elder institution of the Hemerobaptistae that were baptized or washed euerie day. Here Bristowe with a verie stale iest, acknowledgeth their fault, and layeth it vpon Saint Paule, who

hath deceiued them, Rom. 6. where baptisme is in deede remembred, but holie water I trowe is not there. O, then it is 1. Tim 4. where Saint Paule was to blame (saith Bristowe) to tell vs, that the creatures of God are sanctified by the worde of God and by prayer. Wonderfull Diuinitie, that can bring Popish holie water to so holie a beginning! No maruell if we be blinde, which thinke the Apostle speaketh there of the lawfull vse of meates (forbidden by the Pope) and of all other of Gods creatures being sanctified by the worde of God, which giue vs the vse so by praier, that we may vse them well. But specially saith Bristowe, he was to blame for saying. The holy Ghost doth helpe our weaknesse, praying for vs with groanes vnspeakeable, how so euer blinde heretikes thinke he will doe nothing by water for praier. In deede when the scriptures be so plaine for holie water, it is wonder that any be so blinde they can see it.
               Of the Ossenes I saide, they tooke their hallowing of water, salt, oyle, breade, &amp;c. and vse to sweare by them. Bristow asketh if I be an Anabaptist, that will condemne all swearing or swearing by creatures. I aunswere, I will not condemne all swearing, but this customable swearing of Papistes, by this bread, by this salt, &amp;c. and as for swearing by creatures, I am of the same iudgement that our Sauior Christ is, Matth. 5. 34. But Papistes sweare not by them as the Ossenes did, what then? the controuersie is not therein, but of their resemblance with the Ossenes in some part.
               Elxai the father of the Ossenes taught his scholers a praier in a straunge tongue, whose interpretation they might not seeke, whome the Papistes followe in teaching the people to pray in a tongue vnknowne, and will not, (if they may chose) let them knowe the interpretation. Bristowe aunswereth, that Epiphanius saith, his praier was nothing at all when it was interpreted. Is it like Epiphanius would say so? Howe could it be interpreted, if it had no signification? Epiphanius in deed sheweth it was a vaine thing, whereof he made so great a mysterie, and your ignorant people of the great mysteries of the Lordes

prayer, the Salutation and the creede, make vaine and ridiculous matters while they can scarce pronounce their wordes together truly.
               The Marcosians in baptisme vsed for greater admiration certaine Hebrewe wordes; so doe the papistes: Bristowe asketh, whie S. Marke in his greeke writing, vseth yt word Eppheta? I answere, more liuely to expresse the miracle of Christ: yet doth he it not without interpretation. Likewise Saint Iohn, in his Apocalipse vseth Amen and Alleluia, wordes, whose signification was as commonly knowne to all Christians, as their owne mother language. What is this to iustifie the vse of that word in baptisme, which neither Marke nor Iohn speake of? But it was vsed in the time of Ambrose. So Ambros. de Sacralib. 1. cap. 1. were other needlesse matters, yet was it vsed to them that vnderstoode the whole office or seruice of baptisme in latine. Augustine saith it was not lawfull for any Barbarian, or Latine man to translate the words, Amen &amp; Alleluia, which al nations do singe in the Psalmes, into his owne language. For thus he coteth De doct. Chri. lib. 2. cap. 11. &amp; inter Epist. 174. but in neither of thē do I finde any such matter. Certaine it is that Augustine doth giue the signification of them both in latine. Of the Marcionistes (I said) they learned to giue womē leaue to baptise: Bristow saith, we doe our selues therein by order of our booke as much as they doe, but he is deceiued: there is no permissiō in the booke for women to baptise. Touching the necessitie of baptisme, we haue spoken before cap. 6. Finallie I saide the Papistes are Pelagians for holding free will, and merites of workes, as they did, &amp; not predessination and grace as S. Augustine did, Bristow citeth Hierom. Cont. Pela saying, yt it was the heresie of the Manichees, to take away free will. So it was in deede to affirme that the wil of man was inforced or constreined. But that the will of man, is free from the thraldome of sinne, and hath power to merite, without grace, or with grace more easily, it was the heresie of the Pelagians as Augustine in whole bookes written against thē doth declare: But August. Epist. 46. saith, That by the grace of

God a wicked man may be made a iust one, and so may begin to haue good merites, which God shal crown whē the world shal be iudged. I answere by merites he meaneth workes and not desertes: for else how saith he elsewhere (in Ps. 101. &amp; diuers places beside) that God crowneth his giftes and not our merites, where he vseth the name of merites, for desertes? where I saide the papistes colour Pelagianisme with their distinctiō, De congruo &amp; condigno: Bristow saith we do like hypocrites conceale before the people, the distinction of merites before grace, and after grace, for they hold that a man cannot merite the grace of God De congruo without Gods healpe, although they haue no resolute warrant to call the contrarie Pelagianisme or heresie. And why haue you no warant? for reare you should condēne diuers of your cheife pillers the scholemē for heretikes, which hold contrary to that you hold, and yet you all hold that a man may dispose him selfe vnto a certaine aptnes to receiue the grace of God by the power of his free will. Where I said God is as much bound to congruitie as to condignitie: Bristow saith I immagine that if God do not that which is cōgruous, he doth against cōgruitie. Now good sir saith he, It is cōgrue to his mercie, to saue the simple that are out of the Church, which is not cōgruus to his iustice But good sir, I pray you dispute not so of congruine, yt you oppose Gods mercie to his iustice, there is nothing congrue to hismercie, which is not cōgrue to his iustice, for vnto whōsoeuer he wil shew mercie, he hath receiued for them satisfaction to his iustice, in the person of Christ: yet Bristow hath another example for condignitie: For God to saue al the world, it is condigne to the merites of Christ, yet he damneth innumerable, because it is condigne to their owne merites. By this it may be inferred, that God yeeldeth not to the merites of Christ, so much as they deserue, because the merites of many men doe hinder, as though ye merites of al men do not deserue dā
                  nation of cōdignitie, &amp; then what cause is this, why God giueth not to Christs merites so much as they are worthie to receiue, because many deserue damnation? This

foolish sophistrie riseth by reasoning from possibilitie of Christes worthynesse, to the acte of mens worthynesse. But compare acte with acte, and God saueth all his elect for the worthynesse of the merites of Christ by his mercie: and damneth all the reprobate for the worthinesse of their sinne, by his iustice of predestination denied by the papistes, as it is defended by S. Augustine Bristow speaketh neuer a word.
               In the 39. demaund which he calleth Inconfessed heretikes onely: where I answering to the question of Allen Pur 421. 422. with an other question or demaunde why it was reueiled, first to the Arrians in councell, that the article of Christes descent into hell was meete to be added to the Creede which was not in anie symbole before. Bristowe first surmising, as his manner is, that which was neuer thought of, at last confesseth this article to be added in an Arrian Creede, Theodor. Lib 2. cap. 21: affirming that it was before that, in the Apostles Creede, but thereof he bringeth no proofe nor witnesse. The iudgement of the scriptures and not of mens opinions argueth heresies. Let the writinges of the Apostles trie whether of vs is departed from the doctrine of ye Apostles.
               In the 40. demaunde which he termeth, They neuer afore now. Where I saide we agree with the most ancient fathers in the cheefe and most substantiall articles of faith: Bristowe saith, I confesse his purpose. For Vigilantius, Iouinianus &amp;c. did much more agree with them in such articles, yet were not of their church, could not be, and would not be. How proue you that Vigilantius was not of the Church, or woulde not be, although he dissented from Hierom? As for Iouinian, although we hold no part of his assertion in manner as he helde, yet his error was not so great, that he might not be saued with it. Fewe of those fathers but had as great errors as that. It seemeth you would haue no man to be of the ancient Church, except he agree with the ancient fathers in al their errors: if it be proued out of the holy scripture yt Hierom erred, in that wherein he dissented from Vigilantius, why is heto be allowed

in that error, more then in other thinges wherein he and other of those antient fathers erred.

                   time were slaundered: Bristow saith it is a poore and fowle shifte, because Bernard himselfe is witnes against them, as though it were not possible that Bernard might be deceiued by miss

                  information, of them that enuied such kinde of men as they were.
               Where I say it is certaine that Panperes de Lugduno were slaundered: Bristow saith I proue it not. They proue it themselues, being now and long since openly knowne to haue continued in their vnitie from the time of Ioan. Waldo, who separated them by his doctrine and example from the whore of Babilon, in Calabria, Mora

               In the 41. demaunde of studying all truth, Bristowe affirmeth, that with friers and other catholikes, all lea
                     •
                  ning had beene packed away, if the princes had not erected a fewe petite schooles, so he calleth not onelie great colleges, but also whole Vniuersities lately erected. But is there any man so ignorant of the time of suppression of Abbies, that he would thinke all learning was in friers and other papistes? Where I say there was neuer greater store of learning in any age, then is now in protestantes: bristow, maketh me still a childe in the grammer schoole, which thinketh no man can be better learned then his maister, saying: We that knowe your and the Catholike schooles, can but laugh at your childishnes. Why Bristowe, doth no man know the learning of popish vniuersities but you? I haue seene and heard somthing in the most famous vniuersitie in Europe, and yet I sawe nothing, that Cambridge and Oxford may not be bould to compare with it, except it be in multitude of studentes. Where I speake of the tongues and rationall sciences: Bristowe is boulde to affirme. There are more declamations in Greeke in one common schoole of the Iesuites, then in both your vniuersities (I

dare say being ioyned together. What dare you not say, that haue determined to supply in bragging, that you Iacke in learning? if you had named the number, we must perhaps haue yealded to you, if happilie our number of Greeke declamations be not so great as yours. But to giue you an estimation, by that I knowe of one, and one of ye lesser sort of colledges in Cambridg, for the number of Greeke declamations, there are a dosen poore schollers of newe erection, since her Maiesties reigne which are bounde to declaime in greeke euerie Terme, beside their weekely exercise of versifying in greek and latin, and their competent knowledg in the hebrewe tonge, required in them by their foundation, before they can be elected to those places. By which you may gesse, that the knoweledge of the laerned tounges, are not so daintie in our vniuersities, as you thinke. Yea, he dare say they haue better masters of art of two or three, teaching through out all Logike and Phylosophie, then with vs in seuen yeares. This childishe bragge, whereof there is no triall, commeth of the spirite of pride, wherewith Sathan puffeth vp the Papistes, that although in the multitude they be farre inferiour to the professors of the truth, in any kinde of good learning, and for the best of them nothing superior: yet euerie one of meanest knowledg, among whom I take Bristowe for one, so swelleth in opinion of his learning, that he contemneth euen them whose skill he neuer assayed. But their masters of Hebrewe, Greeke, Latine, Poetrie, Logike, Philosophie, doe not count themselues learned in diuinitie, which they neuer studied, or better learned in it, then the professors of it, lacking the tounges, or eloquence, as Saint Thomas Aquinas, Saint Augustine, the Apostles. And what I pray you, doe masters of other sciences among vs challenge the knowledge of diuinitie which they neuer studied, or thinke themselues better learned in it, then the professors of it? But wherefore ioyne you to Thomas Aquinas, who in deede lacketh both tounges &amp; eloquēce. S. Augustine, who was a master of eloquēce,

and not ignorant in tongues, &amp; especially the Apostles, which were indued with heauenly eloquince, and knowledge of all tongues? But it is rudenes and barbarousnes (saith Bristow) in our countrie, to thinke ae meere grammer schoolemaster sufficient to be doctor of diuinitie, yea and a Bishop also, not for other quali

No no master Bristow (for I must requite your curtesie, seeing once in your life you call me master Pulke) we neede not come to your popish schooles, to see your learning, you bewray it sufficiently by your publike writings. And as for ye kingdome of gramarians, I marueile whie you scorne vs with it, as though we had not atteined to the kingdome of any other science or learning. But although we list not to make such large brags of our learning as you doe, I for my part would be ashamed, if there were any knowledg yt in any age was

counted good learning, wherein our side should not be found as forward in England, as any Papist in the world. As for the slaunderous and witlesse railings, of the heretike Stancarus, preferring the Maister of the sentence, before so many Luthers, Melancthons, Caluines, &amp;c. we esteeme as much as the barking of a dogge against the the Moone. Would God we might all meete in some Vniuersitie, where better triall might appeare of both our knowledges, then wise men may gather by our boasting.
               In the three and fourtie Demand of succession, where I saide, there is no such succession of persons and places, promised, as the Papistes boast of: Bristowe saith, the saying of the Apostle, Ephes. 4. promiseth a continuance of Pastors and Doctors vnto the end: which I confesse, but yet is not the orderly succession of persons and places thereby proued, there shall alway be Pastors and teachers in the Church, but it followeth not, that they shall continue in succession of the same roomes, in the same places, as the Papistes boast of the succession of Popes. That he defendeth the offices of Apostles, Prophetes and Euangelistes, to continue alwayes in the Church by succession, being a grosse error, I will not stand to confute, because it is none of the principall matters in controuersie.
               Where I saide, that if succession of persons and places were sufficient, the Greeke Church is able to name as many, as the Latine Church, and in as orderly succession, Ar. 27. Bristowe asketh, what of that, but onely this, that they therefore may better claime the Church than we? Yes this one thing more, that by this my shewing of succession in the Greeke Church, which you can not denie, Allen is bound to recant; and that the Greekes by title of succession, may claime the Church as well as you. But those hereticall and schismaticall Greekes (saith Bristowe) can no more shewe succession than your false Bishops, which are in the sees of Poole, Bonner, Thirlby, &amp;c, and yet I

We may by as good right as you claime succession to the Apostles, and godly Bishop of Rome, whome you succeede not in doctrine. For neither haue you any right succession, but from them that began your heresies and separation from the Christian Church, Boniface the third and his fellowes. But Gregorie saith, the Church of Constantinople is subiect to the Church of Rome. But so doth not the Councels of Constantinople, which before Gregories time decreed, that the Church of Constantinople should be equall in all thinges with the Church of Rome, the title of senioritie onely reserued: because Constantinople was newe Rome. Socr. li. 5. cap. 8. Sozomen. li. 7. ca. 9. Euag. li. 2. ca. 4. Conc. Constantinop. 1. ca. 2. &amp;c.
               
               In the 44. Demaund of the Apostolike see, where I say it auaileth not the Papistes, that the Church was planted at Rome, by the Apostles, except they can proue succession of doctrine, as well as of men: Bristowe saith: In prouing the succession of men only, we do as much as the Fathers did. But I say that is false, for the fathers alledge succession of doctrine in the persons succeeding.
               In the 45 Demaund of chaunging, where I cite the Epistle of Hulderichus Bishop of Auspurge, witnessing that Gregorie was ye first that compelled Priestes to liue vnmarried: Bristowe answereth, that seeing I confesst, that he reuoked his error, he made no change frō his fathers faith: Yes sir, although he reuoked his decree, yet was the same receiued by them that came after him. But the storie of that Epistle is derided by Cope, which affirmeth, that Pope Nicholas the first was dead 56. yeares before Vdalrichus was made Bishop. Thus these impudent Papists, when they can neither corrupt, nor wrest to their purpose, the monuments of antiquitie, they will vtterly denie them.
               Whereas the Papists contrarie to the old vsage of the Church by Allens confession, doe absolue before satisfaction: Bristowe saith, both manners haue bene alwaies vsed, and bringeth example of men absolued i
                     •
                   sicknesse, which if they recouered, performed their satisfaction after. But Papistes absolue them that are in health before

satisfaction, which is contrarie to the old vsage.
               Where I tell them, that Sabinianus condemned the decrees of his predecessor Gregorie, and Stephanus of Formosus: Bristowe saith, not one Pope, hath condemned any decrees made of doctrine. It were hard for him to proue, that none of those Popes, all whose actes their successors disanulled, made any decrees of doctrine. And certaine it is, that Gregorie made decrees of doctrine, or else the Popes Canon lawe doth lie, al whose decrees, yea and bookes also, as containing heresie, his successor Sabinianus condemned and burned. But supposing (saith he) that Pope Honorius was a Monothelite, both in opinion and in some secrete writing, yet did he not change, nor go about to change the Romanes into Monothelites. What meant he then to write hereticall Epistles, but to drawe other into his heresie? Did not his writings to Sergius Bishop of Constantinople, plainely discouer him to the Councel, that he followed that heretikes minde in all things, and confirmed these vngodly opinions? Con. Constantin. 6. Action. 13. And to what end? but betwene them to change the faith of the whole Church, both of the East and of the West. into Monothelitisme? But that you may see a plaine contradictorie vnto Bristowes bolde and lying affirmation, I will rehearse the wordes of Pope Leo the second, in his Epistle vnto the same Councel, Act. 18. Pariter
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         anathematizamus &amp;c. Also we accurse, the inuentors of the newe error &amp;c. naming them, &amp; among them Honorius which did not lighten this Apostolike Church, with doctrine of Aposto like tradition, but by prophane treason, did go about to ouerthrowe the immaculate faith. Yet against al this testimonie of antiquitie, Sander in his Monarchie proueth, that Honorius was no Monothelite, and that Iohn 22. did not, as Caluine and we belie the storie, denie the immortalitie of the soule, and resurrection of the bodie, neither was any such thing laide against him by his contentious enimies, but whether the soules doe see God before the generall resurrection, but he also denied that error &amp;c. To this I must needes say, that Bristowe is either an ignorant reporter, or an impudent lier, except

he will say that Caluine or some of vs wrote, the report of the Councel of Constance, where he was accused and conuicted by witnesse, to haue denied the mortalitie of the soule, and the resurrection of the body, and life euerlasting, Session. II. And in the next Session he confessed, that the Councel of Constance was most holie, and could not erre. As for the assertion of Pope Ioane the feminine Pope, I referre the reader to Maister Iewels replie to Harding, where he proueth it, by auncienter testes, than Martinus Polonus, howe so euer Bristowe sawe it in a marginall note, I wot not where, not in what Protestantes hand, as he reporteth.
               In the sixe and fourtie Demaund of our auncetors saued or damned, he maruelleth where my wit was, when I alledged against Canonization, ye example of burning Hermannus the heretike in Ferraria, where he was worshipped twentie yeares Apocryphally. But if he had not bene canonized as you say, where was the Popes care of the Church, that so neare him in Italie, he would suffer such grosse idolatrie, so long time to be committed and continued? Wherefore except you bring better prose for your negatiue the affirmatiue that he was canonized, which so long had bene worshipped, without contradiction is more probable, seeing you hold that the Romish Church can not suffer any vngodly vsage, so long to be vncontrolled.
               Where I saide, the Papistes can not proue, that the Pope and Popish Church hath canonized the Apostles &amp; principall Martyrs: Bristowe asketh, if making of holie daies, and to name them in diptychis among Saintes, in the holy Canon of the Masse is not proofe sufficient, of their canonization. No sir, if that be canonization, which your late Canons and practise doth allowe: but if it were, I say, the Apostles and principal Martyrs had daies of remembrance of their godly life, and doctrine, names in the tables, and at the celebration of the Lordes supper, before canonization was thought to pertaine onely to the Pope. As for our abrogating of Saintes

dayes, doth not disproue our Communion with the Saintes, which is in consent of their faith, not in celebrating of their feastes. Concerning the canonization of King Henrie the sixt: Bristowe requireth mine authour for a dilatorie plea, because he can not otherwise defend the Popish corruption. Mine authour is Edward Hall in his Chronicles of Henrie the seuenth, where I said we acknowledge those to be Saintes, whose names are written in the booke of life. Bristowe like a blacke dogge scoffeth at it, and saith, we might doe well to set out that booke in print, that they might correct their Calender by it. Or else the Churches declaration is the most certaine way to knowe who are written in it. If none should be written, but such as the Pope doth canonize (for that is your Churches declaration) innumerable Papistes, should haue no place therein, and not onely Papistes, but the true Saintes of God, of whome not one among tenne thousand, hath bene canonized. Where I say, the Popish Church doth iniurie to the Saintes of God, that she doth not so account them while they liue: Bristowe saith I would be called Saint Fulke, by mine owne industrie, and that out of hande. Thus hath he nothing but Heathenish scornes, to delude the textes of Scripture, which I cited, to proue that the Church of GOD counteth all true Christians Saintes, euen in this life, not by their owne industrie and merites, but by the sanctification of the bloud of Christ.
               He is angrie that I compare the Popes canonizations with the Heathen Senates canonizing of their Goddes, saying, wee doe the like in canonizing our selues, because wee account our selues Saintes, and true Christians, which is all one, and because I shewe, the emulation of the Bohemians, in solemnizing the memories of Iohn Hus and Hierome of Prage, which differeth as much from Popish canonization, as their faith and religion differeth from Poperie.
               In ye 47. Demand of cōmunion of Saints, he boasteth of increase of Papists in England, affirming, yt 
                  beside thē which

are Catholike in heart and of their communion, there be innumerable of them reconciled, which he saith, to prepare the minds of his friendes vnto their intended massacre and rebellion. I suppose in deede, there are too many of those dissembling and professed traitors: but yet not so many, but they may be numbred. But howe many so euer they are, I doubt not, but there are Christians of such number and power in England, as are able to giue all the Papistes both on this side the sea, and beyond it, as blacke a day as the Popes armie found in Ireland, if euer they attempt to put in practise their long intended and certainly purposed treasonable deuises.
               In the 48. Demaund, where I shewe the fruites of the Gospell, being vrged thereto by Allen, Pur. 241. to appeare notably in the liberall prouision for the poore of all sorts in England, and namely in the citie of London: Bristowe calleth it beastly impudencie: yet is he not able to name any Popish citie, that maketh such prouision; but falleth into open railing, vpon the corrupt manners of all the citie, as though for the fault of many, (which yet Gods name be praised, are not the most) the whole citie were not inferior to Sodome and Gomorrhe in wickednesse: In which place as being very populous, there are many offenders, so are they punished if their offences may be knowne. But who so knewe London in the time of Poperie, and nowe also considereth the manners of the multitude, must be a very vnequall iudge, if he acknowledge not great reformation in a great number, though he can not see it all. As for the citie of Rome, which Bristowe compareth with Solomon, whose Priestes were more excellēt than the report that went of him: as by ye storie and relation of them which knewe it before this time, so by report of some which euen in this time haue visited the same, we haue sufficient vnderstanding, that without great reformation, it still continueth the mother of all abhominations of the earth, and reaching forth ye cup of poisoned wine, vnto such as seeke her whorish familiaritie, maketh them therewith so drunke, that there is no cause why Bristowe should maruell why nothing

confirmeth more our countrimen in Poperie, nor alienateth them from the Protestants, than to goe and see Rome.
            
            
               The eleuenth Chapter.
               
                  What grosse contradictions Fulke is driuen to vtter against Bristowe. him self, while he struggleth against Gods Church, and the doctrine thereof.
               
               As in his whole replie, he hath drawen almost all ye arguments Fulke. and authorities, which I vsed in those two treatises, vnto other endes and purposes, than for which I brought them: so to make a shewe of Contradiction, he rendeth a number of my sayings from their proper places, &amp; compareth them together, to make such as know not what a Contradiction meaneth, to thinke that I affirme and denie meere repugnancies, without any possibilitie to reconcile them. But when they are considered according to the circumstance of the place, in which they are written, I hope there are not many of so meane iudgement, but they will acknowledge, they are rather the cauils of Bristowe, than the contradictions of Fulke.
               The first Contradiction he noteth, that I say, Art 96. You are neuer able to aunswere the arguments that Peter was neuer at Rome. And thē where is the Apostolike see? &amp;c. And thē on the conirarie side: the Church of Rome was founded by the Apostles, it was an Apostolike Church. For this he quoteth Purg. 361. 363. 374. To this I aunswere: In the first part he falsifieth my wordes, which are these: You are neuer able to answere the arguments, that are brought to proue that Peter was neuer Bishop at Rome, and then where is all your bragges of Apostolike see and succession? &amp;c. The Church of Rome might bee an Apostolike see, though Peter was neuer there: but all your bragges of Apostolike see, and succession are vaine, if Peter was neuer Bishop of Rome.
               The second: Those auncient Fathers did appeale to the iudgement of the Church of Rome against all heresies, and among the

Catholike Churches, especially named the Church of Rome, because it continued in the doctrine of the Apostles, Pur. 373. 374. Contrat And by the way note here the bragge of the Romane faith Pur. 405. The former proposition is not mine, but patched by him, yet if I graunt the sense and wordes to be, as he hath forged them, they are not contradictorie to the latter proposition. For heretikes may bragge of that which Catholikes vse to doe: and yet not be Catholikes.
               The thirde: It had by succession (speaking of the Church of R
                        〈…〉
                     ) retained euen vntill their dayes, that faith which it did first receiue of the Apostles. Pur. 374. Contra: She the Church of Rome hath had no orderly succession of Bishoppes, except so many schismes as they write of, be orderly successions. By the time of these Fathers (saith Bristowe) there had bene foure schismes. Ar. 85. Aunswere. In the first proposition I speake of Tertullians time and succession of doctrine, and name succession simplie. In the second proposition I speake of the whole time vntill our dayes, and of succession of persons, and of orderly succession: therefore no contradiction.
               The fourth: It continued at that time in the doctrine of the Apostles, it retained by succession that faith which it did first receiue of the Apostles. Pur. 373. 374. Contra: he chargeth it with sundrie errors here cap. 3. &amp; 4 namely P. Liberius with Arianisme. P. Innocentius for housling of Insantes, and eight Popes for the supremacie. I might aunswere, that the charging of the Popes, chargeth not the Church. but in the first proposition, I spake of the Church of Rome, in the time of Irenaeus, and Tertullian, holding the doctrine of the Apostles, contrarie to those heresies against which they write.
               The fift: It was a true Church, and Apostolike Church, a faithfull Church, true and Apostolike faith and religion haue dwelled in her. Pur. 374. Ar. 79. Contra: The Church of Rome neuer preached the trueth. She neuer had since she first arose the ministring of sacraments according to Christes institution. The true Catholike Church hath ouerthrowen heresies of all sortes. But the Popish Church was neuer able to encounter with heretikes. Rome may be a nurse of Antichristi
                     
                        〈…〉
                     ns,

but neuer did good to Christians. I am able to proue that the primitiue Church affirmed your Church to be the Church of Antichrist. Ar. 85. 16. 106. 10. 27.
               The latter part of this contradiction, with as many falsifications as there be quotations, doe sufficiently declare, that in all those places, I speake of the Popishe Church of Rome that nowe is, and not of the true Church which of olde time was at Rome. Yet to giue the reader a taste of his falsification of my wordes Ar. 106. which hee rehearseth thus. Rome may be a nurse, &amp;c. in truth they are these: Rome which feedeth her babes with poison of mans traditions, in steade of the milke of Gods worde, and will rather see them famish than they should taste of Gods worde, may well bee a nurse of Antichristians, but neuer did good vnto Christians.
               The sixt: The Popish Church is a puddle of all false doctrine and heresie, whereof the whore beareth a cuppe full, out of which all nations haue dronke. Ar. 102. 38. Euen from the Apostles 
                        •
                     ime the diuell neuer left to set in his foote, for his sonne Antichristes dominion, vntill he had placed him in the temple of God, and prepared the wide world for his walke, and then came the generall defection. Pur. 287. Contra: all nations neuer consented to the doctrine of the Papistes. For it hath bene often saide, the Greeke Church and (all) other Orientall Churches (of Assa and Africa) neuer receiued the Popish religion, in many chiefe points, and specially in acknowledging the Popes authoritie, they will not vnto this day acknowledge her doctrine to be Catholike, nor her authoritie to be lawfull. Ar. 38. 16 33. 34.
               These places being both full of falsifications, yet if they had bene in so many wordes set downe by me, imploy no contradiction. For it may be, that all n
                     •
                  tions, (meaning as the scripture, whose wordes I cite Apoc. 18. not all of euerie nation, but some of all nations) haue dronke of the whores cup, and yet neuer receiued her religion in al things. And the general defection is meant of that great apostasie that S. Paul speaketh of, in which the greatest number shall fall from Christ, though they

fall not all to the Pope. For many are fallen to Mahomet, many reuolted to idolatrie, many to other heresies beside Poperie.
               The 7. The religion of Papistes came in, and preuailed in the yere of our Lord 607. in which the Pope first obtained his Antichristiā exaltatiō to wit, Boniface ye 
                  third of Phocas the Emperor, that the Bishop of Rome should be called and counted the heade of all the Church. Ar. 36. Contra in the same place: Because you speak of the first entring of Popish religion, which dependeth chiefly vpon the Popes authoritie: it first beganne to aduaunce it selfe in Victor, about the yeare of our Lord 200. What contradiction is here? Popish religion in one piece first beganne to aduaunce it selfe Anno 200. and after came in and preuailed, Anno 607.
               The 8. The Popish Church is a puddle of all false doctrine and heresie. Euen in the Apostles time, and from that time, in all times, when so euer, and where so euer was any piece of myste or darke corner, there were the steppes of your walke. It may be a shame for you Papistes, to leaue and condemne for heresie, all that is true in the Fathers writings, and agreeable to the scriptures. Ar. 102. Pur. 287. 238. Contra: Where he dictinguisheth the religion of the papistes, from the great heresies, and open aduersaries, that sought to beate downe the chiefe foundations of Christian faith, as the Valentinians, Marcionistes, Manichees, Arrians, Sabellians, and such like monsters. Ar. 43. He falsifieth my distinction, which is not of the religion of the Papistes, but of the first beginnings of such errors in the time of the auncient Fathers, which among the Papistes are growne to be in manner as great as the monsters of Valentinians, Marcionistes, &amp;c. And yet there can be no contradiction, where the subiectes of both propositions are not all one. But here the one is of the Popish Church (which is a member of the malignant congregation of Satan) the other is of the religion of Papistes. The Papistes by communion of the diuels Church, communicate with all heresies.
               The 9. We say not that the religion of Papistes came in soudenly, but that it entred by small degrees at the first: and therefore 
                        •

                     esse espied by the true Pastors being earnestly occupied against great heresies, not preached against, winked at, because it had a

shewe of Pietie and Charitie, and at length allowed of Augustine and others, who followed the common errors of their time. Specially when a generall defection, and departing from the faith was foreshewed, what marueile were it, if none colde preach against it as it first entred? Ar. 43. 36. 38. Contra: The Church of Christ in such places as she is, suffereth no man damnablie abusing her religion, without open reprehension. Ar. 92. 36. 37. The former proposition hath manifest forgeries, as that I should say, The religion of papistes was not preached against &amp;c. Winked at &amp;c. Allowed of Augustine &amp;c. For I neuer said so of the whole religion of papists, but of some fewe errors budding vp in antient times. But both Ar. 36. where I aske What maruaile &amp;c. as an obiection, I doe neuerthelesse shewe who preached against the vsurpation of the Bishop of Rome, which yet tended not to a damnable error; &amp; Ar. 38. I affirme, there was both preaching, teaching, and writing against it.
               The 10 The true, catholike Church hath alwaies resisted all false opinions, contrarie to the word of God, as her dewty was, and fought against them, and obteined the victorie, and triumphed ouer them. Ar. 11. Contra: In those antient times they of the true Church, did not alwaies weigh what was most agreeable to the word of God: but if heretikes had any thing that seemed to haue a shew of pietie or charitie, they would drawe it into vse. So they tooke into the Church of Christ, many abuses and corruptions, vntill at the length, An. 607. the religion of the papists preuailed. And since that time that diuelish heresie hath alwaies increased in error vntill the yeare 1414. Pur. 419. Ar. 35. 36. The former proposition is directly spoken and meant by me, of heresies against the truth, and other articles of faith: That which is mine in the latter patchery and falsification, is spoken of small errors and idle ceremonies.
               The 11 That blasphemous heresie of purgatorie, which is most blasphemous against Christ, against the blood of Christ, against his merites and satisfaction for our sinnes, and against Gods vnspeakable mercies: and occasion of most licentious wickednes in all them that beleeue it, nothing conuenient for the disciples and members of Christ. No suffrages were made for the dead by the

Apostles or their lawfull successors. To the reader, Pur. 26. 166; 184. 177. 269. 362. 363. 419. 186. Contrà: here. cap. 3. he confesseth that the fathers held it, and yet notwithstanding, that they were members of the true Church (cap. 2.) and held the foundation of Iesus Christ (cap. 5.) &amp; all the substance of true doctrine: And also that they did inuocate Saintes: denying in other places that such be true Christians. The like of fasting. Pur. 
                     •
                  93. 405.
               I neuer confessed those godly fathers to hold purgatorie in such blasphemous sense, as the papistes doe, nor yet prayer for the dead, or inuocation of Saintes. By fasting, I knowe not what he meaneth, for in the page, whereto he sendeth me 141. is no such matter spoken of, nor fasting once named.
               12 The opinion of Purgatorie and satisfaction of sinnes after this life, is the verie doctrine of licentiousnesse, to maintaine wicked men in their presumptuousnesse. For what hast will they make to amendment and newenesse of life, when they haue hope of release after their death? Pur. 51. 26. 166. 177. 184. Contra: As Saint Augustine saith, it is but for small faultes: or as M. Allen saith, for great faultes that by penance are made small. And is God such a mercifull father to punishe small faultes so extremely in his children, whom he pardoneth of all their great and heinous sinnes? Pur. 448.
               The latter part of this pretēsed cōtradictō is not mine, but Allens assertion, which I rehearse to shew the absurditie of his expositiō of the happy rest promised. Apo. 13.
               13 How long soeuer the true Church were hidden, whether i
                        •
                      were a 1000. years, or 2000. yeares, this is certaine, that out of this Church none could be saued. Ar. 73. Contra, here cap. 5. he counteth it ynough, if the faith of their saluation were in the onely foundation Iesus Christ, and that in such a sense as agreeth to men indeed out of the Church.
               
               The whole faith of their saluation is in the onely foundation Iesus Christ, in such such sense as I speake cannot be out of the Church.
               14 They which hold the foundation, that is Christ (to wit the Article of Iustification by the onely mercy of God, and of the onely sonne of God) are doubtlesse members of the true Church of Christ.

                  8. Contra: here cap. 10. where he saith, that the Anabaptists are abhominable heretikes, and that they are not Protestāts: who yet do hold that article i
                        •
                     mp as the Protestāts do.
               
               It is a loudly, and neuer saide of me, that the Anabaptists do hold that article iump as the protestants.
               15 A generall departing from the faith, was foreshewed, and it was fulfilled An. 607. Contra: The Church was neuer lost (neither when the departing was generall) but hidden (in the wildernesse, that is) from the eyes of the world. She is to this day preserued, and shalbe to the worlds end. Christ hath neuer wanted his Spouse in earth, he hath euer beene a head without a body. Ar. 36. 38. Ar. 71. 78. 79. 80.
               The generall departing from the faith, was not of all persons, but of most in all nations: and therefore the Church neuer failed.
               16 The primitiue Church of the Apostles hath continued vnto this day by succession not of persons and places, but of the doctrine, faith, and trueth. These verte wordes conteine a manifest contradiction. For how can a Church, or doctrine, faith, and trueth continue, but in persons and places? in so much that he saith also: We doubt not, but God hath alway stirred vp some faithfull teachers, that haue instructed his Church in the necessarie pointes of Christian Doctrine. Ar. 2. 96. 26. 27.
               These wordes conteine no contradiction. For the Church may continewe in persons and places, although not by continual succession of persons in the same places. Bristow forgetteth his rules of contradiction, opposing cōtinuance by succession of persons and places, to continuance in persons and places.
               17 The true Church of Christ hath alwayes stoode stedfast &amp; inseparable from Christ her head, though the blinde world, when they see her, will not acknowledge her to be his Spouse, but persecute her, as if she were an adultresse, Contra: in the same place: The true Church vnder the Emperours Constantinus, Constans, and Valens, was greatly infected with the heresie of Arius. And in another place: The visible Church may become an adultresse, and be diuorsed from Christ. And so is that faithfull Church of Rome become an harl
                        ••
                     .
               
               
                  
This contradiction is made vp with a falsification of my wordes: The true Church vnder the Emperours Constantius, &amp;c. For I say not, the true Church, but speake generally of the Church, which suffered persecution vntill Cōstantine, which was ye visible Church, vnder which name many heretikes were persecuted. Visible Church is not alwaies the true Church.
               The 18 The true Church consisting of Gods elect, and the liuely members of the body of Christ, shall neuer commit such adulterie &amp;c. But the visible Church may separate her selfe from Christ. As though there were an other Church besides the visible Church, and so two churches. Contra: Wheresoeuer the Catholike Church be in partes, it is one body of Christ.
               
               There are not two Churches, but one. The catholike Church is alwaies inuisible: the militant Church on earth, which is a part thereof, is to the world sometime visible, and sometimes not seene of the world.
               The 19 Anno. 607. the Church fled into the wildernes, that is, out of the sight and knowledg of the world, there to remaine a long season: where all this while God hath preserued her vntill such time as he thought good, now in our dayes to bring her out of her secret place in the wildernes, into the open sight of the world againe. Ar. 16. 27. 79. 36. Contra: Diuers times it was bold to chalenge preaching &amp; ministring of the sacramētes, yea and so boldly, that it cost many of the chalengers their liues: As Berengarius, Brumo, Marsilius de Padua, Ioannes de Gaudano. Ioannes Wickleue, Waldo, Ioannes Hus, Ieronymus de Praga, &amp;c. Ar. 77.
               The onely shew of contradiction, is a falsification of of Bristow, reporting my wordes, Where all this while &amp;c. As though the Church hath alwaies bin so hidden, ye no members thereof might appeare. But those wordes be of his own cauillous cōpositiō, &amp; not of my writing. But here beside the contradiction, he noteth two thinges against me, One, that it cost not all these, yea, verie fewe of these there liues. Neither did I say, it cost al, but many, to iustifie this multitude: Iohn Hus and Hierom are expressed beside many hundrethes that are conteined vnder &amp;c.
               
                  The other matter is that neither these before appearing, were secret protestans, but open papistes. Belike he would beare vs in

hand, that their open appearing &amp; conuersiō from popery, was both in a moment of time. But what if some of them were first papistes, and afterward returned from popery to ye catholike Church, as Hus &amp; Hierom, being conuerted by certaine Englishmen, yet weere they not al such, for Waldo was neuer any papist, but a christian Catholike, who seeing the horrible enormities of the Romish synagogue, openly with many thowsands, I renoū
                  ced her communion, when she would not be reformed at his godly preaching.
               20 To bring her againe into open light. Which is now brought to passe in our dayes. Ar, 16. 9
                     •
                  . Contra: from the yere of our Lord 1414. (being the time of the Councell of Constance) the bright beames of the Gospell haue shined in the world. Ar. 36.
               I see no signe of cōtradictiō in these words, except these propositiōs be cōtradictorie: The bright beames of ye sun do shine in ye morning before ye sun be ful risen: &amp;, ye same is seene in opē light after he is fully risē aboue ye earth.
               The 21 The reuelation of Antichrist (with the Churches flight into the wildernes) was An. 607. when Bonifacius the 3. &amp;c. For vntill then the mysterie of iniquitie was preparing for his reuelation &amp; cōming, &amp; for the generall defection. Ar. 38. 36 16. Contra: She hath not decaied there in the wildernes, but beene alwayes preserued, vntill God should reueile Antichrist, which is now brought to passe in our dayes. Ar. 16.
               The reuelation of the mystery of iniquitie was, when Antichrist himselfe did opēly shew that iniquitie which before was not throughly discouered. God reueileth Antichrist, when he openeth vnto men his horrible wickednes, which to them were vnknowne. A wonderfull contradiction of Antichrist reueiling himselfe, and God reueiling Antichrist.
               The 22 The Churches being in the wildernes, was, to be out of the sight &amp; knowledg of the wicked. Ar. 27. 95. Contra, speaking of the same space, She was narrowly persecuted of the Romish Antichrist for a long seasō. Againe: Although it were knowne to the papists, yet it was in Italie when Marsilius of Padua preached: in Fraunce, when Waldo: in England, when Wickleue: in Bohemia, when Hus, and Ierom of Prage did florish. Why? all these were

well knowne to the papistes. As though the Church could not be persecuted in her mēbers, except she were al knownē, or knowne to be the Church by her persecutors.
               23 A rule of ye 
                  Logiciās: No man knoweth a relatiue, except he know the correlatiue thereof: Therefore though Christ had a body in earth. yet could it be known of none, but such as knew Christ the head of that body, of whom the papistes were ignorant. A 1. 80. Contra: Our Church is now againe brought to light and knowledge of the world. Ar. 96. So that now belike the papistes know Christ, or the Logicians rule is verified onely for the time of the Churches being in the wildernes, according as in other places he moderateth the matter, saying: We beleeue that the Church is not alwayes knowne to the wicked vpon earth. Pur. 150. Ar. 77. 79, 80.
               Whether the papistes know Christ or no, certaine it is, they will not acknowledg him, who came into the world, which was made by him, and yet the world knew him not, whom they would not acknowledge. The papists cannot say, they know not our Church, although they will not acknowledge her to be the true Church, and so my saying is true, that our Church is brought into knowledg euen of ye world of papistes. The rules of Logiciās are alway true, but they are often ill kept by popish sophisters, as ye rules of cōtradictiō here by Bristow.
               24 We beleeue that the vniuersal Church is not seene at all of men, because it is in heauen Pur. 405. Ar. 95. 82. 74 80. Contra: Our Church, when it was most hidden, might rightly be called Catholike (that is vniuersall) &amp;c. Here Cap. 10. Dem. 6: And whereas you say, that no man aliue could name the place where it was, you make an impud
                        •
                     nt lye: For although it were vnknowen to the Papistes and enimies thereof, yet was it knowen to the true members thereof.
               
               I see no opposition, except you will say, there is no knowledge but by bodilie sight, or that some members of the Church, may not be seene in earth, because Ierusalem the mother of vs all, is aboue.
               25 And as for our Mother Church is no certaine place, or cō
                     panie of men in any one place vpon earth, but Ierusalem which is aboue, is mother of vs all. Pur. 377 Contra: That no man aliue could name the place where it was, is an impudent lie. It was in

Italie, when Marsilius preached, &amp;c. Vt suprà in contrad. 22. Christe hath neuer wanted his spouse in earth, though the blinde worlde when they see her, will not acknowledge her to bee his spouse, but persecute her as if she were an adultresse. She was knowne to them that were her children. The church of Christ is the nurse of Christians. Ierusalem that is from aboue, is mother of vs all. Ar. 95 79 82. 106.
               Those are as great contradictions as these. Bristowe is at Louane. Bristowes foote is in his shooe. The whole Church and mysticall body of Christ is in heauen: therfore some members and parts therof can not be on earth.
               26 It is not called Catholike, because it should be euery where. For that it neuer was, nor neuer shall be. Ar. 95. Contra: It should ouerflowe and fill all the world with righteousnesse. Esai. 10. That God hath an holie vniuersall congregation, it is necessarie to beleeue. It is dispersed in many places ouer all the world. Ar. 73. 83. 80.
               It is not euery where: and it is in many places: be not contradictorie. And the remnant may ouerflowe and fill the world with righteousnesse, as Esai saith: although it fill not euery place and person thereof, nor most places and persons alwaies.
               27 Christes church is nowe by GOD enlarged further than the Popish church. Ar. 12. 3. 69. Contra: It is but a small flocke in comparison of the malignant church (of Antichrist) whose number is as the sand of the sea. Apoc. 20.
               The Popish Church is not so large as the malignant Church of Sathan by many partes, which containeth all the wicked of the world, the name of Antichrist is added by Bristow. Yet are there more Antichristes than ye Pope, although he be the chiefe yt sitteth in the temple of God.
               28 It is a good argument, that the Popish church is not the church of Christ, because it was neuer hidden since it first sprang vp: in so much that you can name the notable persons in all ages, in their gouernement and ministerie, and especially the succession of the Popes, you can rehearse in order vpon your fingers. And it were a token that our church were not the true church, if wee could name such notable persons in their gouernement and ministerie. Ar. 27. Contra: Such officers as are necessarie

for the conseruation of Gods people in the vnitie of faith and the knowledge of Christe, our Church hath neuer lacked, notwithstanding that through iniurie of the time (because our Church had not so many Registers, Chroniclers, and remembrauncers) the remembraunce of all their names is not come vnto vs. For the authoritie of the Bible, we haue the testimonie of the true Church in all ages. Our congregation hath euer had possession of the Scriptures. GOD hath neuer suffered the true Church to be destitute of the necessarie vse of the Scripture: Which the Popish Church hath so kept in an vnknowne tongue, that the people could haue no vse, much lesse the necessarie vse thereof. The Church of GOD hath alwayes had Schooles and Vniuersities for the maintenance of godly learning. The true Catholike Church hath alwayes resisted all false opinions. It was neuer so secrete nor hidden, but it might be knowne of all those that had eyes to see it. That a thousand yeares there was gathering together for preaching, ministring, and correcting. God hath alway stirred vp some faithfull teachers. The Church hath neuer bene afraide to doe her office towardes her children and true members, in teaching, exhorting, comforting, confirming, &amp;c. Ar. 28. 27. 9. 6. 5. 52. 11. 74. 75. 26. 82.
               In these large propositions, howesoeuer they be patched, I see no contradiction. Except these be contraditories: The Church was sometime hidden from her enemies: and yet where shee was gathered, did performe all duties to her friendes and children. It was not seene of the blinde, but it was seene of them that had eies.
               29 The Popish Church was neuer hidden since it first sprang vp. Ar. 27. Contra: The Church of Rome hath not alwayes practised open preaching, and neuer preached the worde of trueth. Ar. 85.
               There was small preaching before the orders of begging friers began to supply the want of the pastors. And yet the popish Church glistered in her whorish pompe.
               30 Touching the text Matthewe 5. of a citie built vpon an hill, which can not be hidden, after he hath giuen his sense of it, he saith: Hereby it appeareth howe fondly some Papistes (and some of the Doctors in their errour) doe expound this place to groue, that the Church must alwayes bee visible. Ar. 100.

                  Contra: euen in his owne exposition there: It is properly meant of the Apostles and their su
                        ••
                     essours the Ministers of the Church: he teacheth them aboue all other men, to looke diligently to their life and conuersation: for as they excell in place and dignitie, so the eyes of all men are set vpon them. As a citie builded vpon an hill, must needes be seene of all that come neare it, so they being placed in so high an office and dignitie, shall be noted and marked aboue all other men. One part of the Church is alwayes visible to the eyes of all men, and can not be hidden: and yet the whole Church, and so also that part, is not alwayes visible, but may be hidden, and was hidden for a thousand yeares. So he saith.
               
               The whole Church, which is the mysticall body of Christe, is inuisible. Although the ministers of the Church and their conuersation, can not be hidden from the members of euery particular Church.
               31 The true Church decaied immediatly after the Apostles time. And so the errour of praying for the dead was continued from a corrupt state of the church of Christ, vnto a plaine departing away into the Church of Antichrist. Contra: The Primitiue pure church for the space of an hundreth yeares after Christ. Againe: Anno 607. The church fled into the wildernesse, there to remaine a long season, where she hath not decayed, but bene alwaies preserued, vntill God should bring her againe to open light nowe in our daies. The true church shall neuer decay, but alway reigne with Christ. The false synagogue shall' daily more and more decay, vntill it be vtterly destroied with Antichrist the head thereof. If this be not contradiction, it is much worse, to wit, that Luther and his Apostles haue giuen vs a visible church which shall not decay, Whereas Christ and his Apostles gaue vs a visible church which did decay, yea and plainely depart away into Apostasie.
               
               The places shew that decaying hath double vnderstanding. The true Church soone after the Apostles, decayed in syncerity, yet neuer decayed nor shall decay in continuance. Luther gaue no Church; but euen that Church which is best lightened by his preaching, may decay in sincerity, if the pastors be not diligent to teach the word of God simply.
               
                  
32 At euery word hee calleth the Pope Antichrist, and the head of the malignant church. Contra: in some places he maketh two distinct heades and their distinct companies. As, when Mahomet in the East, and Antichrist the Pope in the West, seduced the world, then the church fled into the wildernesse. Againe: The Popish church is not in euery part of the world: for Mahomets sect is in the greatest part. Ar. 16. 65.
               I call the Pope Antichrist oftentimes: but that I call the Pope head of the malignant Church, though Bristowe saith I doe it at euery word, yet he is not able to note one place where I doe it, rather Bristowe maketh a flat contradiction in saying of me, At euery word he calleth the Pope the head of the malignant church. Contra: In some places he maketh two distinct heades, and their distinct companies.
               
               33 That the true church may erre, and hath erred, notwithstanding any priuiledge it hath by Gods spirit, we heard him say, cap. 3. Nowe to the contrarie. Neither hath the spirit of God failed to leade her into all trueth. There be some prerogati
                        •
                     es of Gods spirite, that are necessarie for the saluation of Gods elect, as the gift of vnderstanding, the gift of faith, &amp;c. And these the spouse of Christe hath neuer wanted. True faith, &amp;c. might be signes of the true church. The spouse of Christe heareth the voice of Christe, and is ruled thereby. The church of GOD is the piller and stay of truth, so called, because that where so euer the church is, either visible or inuisible, there is the trueth. Saint Paule by this title doth admonish Pastors and preachers, howe great a burthen and charge they sustaine, that the trueth of the Gospell can not be continued in the world, but by their ministerie in the church of God, which is the piller and stay of truth. This their duetie true preachers considering, are diligent in their calling to preach the trueth. As our church is the piller and stay of trueth, so is she also the house of trueth, which knoweth nothing but him that is the trueth it selfe Iesus Christ, and his most holy Scripture, in which this trueth is signed and testified. We require you to beleeue the true Catholike church onely: and immediatly againe to the contrarie: We require you not to beleeue any one companie of men, more than an other. Ar. 82. 81. 93. 99. 62. 77. 100. 108. 62.
               This contradiction is easily reconciled. The true

Church may erre, but not in any point, that is necessarie to euerlasting saluation. We require men to beleeue the true Catholike Church only, not for the companie, but for the trueth.
               34 The error (of Purgatorie and praying for the deade) is continued from a corrupt state of the church of Christe, vnto a plaine departing away into the church of Antichrist. Contra: The t
                        •
                     ue and onely church of God is so guided by Gods spirite, and directed by his word, that she can not induce any damnable error to con

                        ••
                     : No, nor suffereth any man dānably abusing her religion, without open reprehension: and yet Purgatorie, &amp;c. came in with silence.
               
               The error of praying for the dead, was not damnable, while it continued in the Church of Christ, the Church of Antichrist by derogating full satisfaction from the bloud of Christ, hath made it damnable.
               35 The church of Christ hath of the holie Ghost a iudgement to discerne true writings from counterfets, and the worde of GOD of infallible veritie, from the writing of men which might erre. She hath commended the bookes of holy Scripture to be beleeued of all true Christians. We persuade vs of the authoritie of Gods booke, because we haue most stedfast assurance of Gods spirite for the authoritie of it, with the testimonie of the true church in all ages. Ar. 5. 4. 9. Contra: All other writings are in better case than the Scriptures are with you. For other writings may be counted the workes of their authours, without your censure: the holy Scripture may not be counted the worde of God, except you list so to allow it. Other writings are of credite according to the authoritie of the writers: The holie Scriptures with you houe not credite according to the authoritie of God the authour of them, but according to your determination. Pur. 219.
               Here is no shewe of contradiction, but a wretched begging of the principle, that the Popish Church is the true Church of Christ. Of such contradictions you may make not 50 but 500000.
               36 Those that by true Christians haue bene called and counted for heretikes, haue proued so in deede. Ar. 65. Contra: This Demaund hath a false principle: that the church ought to be a Christian mans (onely: it is not in Doctor Allens principle)

stay in al troubles and tempestes.
               
               The first proposition is an Ironicall imitation of Allens absurd proposition, and not an absolute assertion of mine.
               37 And therefore the Papistes, being called and counted heretikes of true Christians (that is, of the Protestantes) without doubt are heretikes in deede. Ar 65. Contra. He is a foolish Sophister, that reasoneth from names to things: as you doe most vainely and childishly. Ar. 66.
               The former proposition, is the conclusion which I retort vpon Allens principle, that whosoeuer by true christians are called heretikes, do proue so in deede.
               38 There is neuer heresie, but there is as great doubt of the church, as of the matter in question. Ar. 86. Contra: Augustines argument of the publike prayers of the church, tooke no hold of the Pelagians by force of trueth that is in it, but by their owne confession and graunt, of that prayer to be godly, and them to be of the church that so prayed. But now the controuersie is not onely of the substance of doctrine, but of the church it selfe also. The Donatistes challenged the church to themselues. Pur. 367.
               Here is not so much as any shadowe of contradiction, for in the heresie of the Donatists, the chiefest controuersy was of the Church: as for the prayer of the Church, they vsed it themselues as well as the true Catholikes, out of which prayer Augustine gathereth an argument against them.
               39 But for the chiefe pointes of christian religion, and the foundation of our faith, that is, Reall presence, &amp;c. the most approued writers are vtterly against you, and therefore can not be of your church. Contra: But the Lutheranes and Zuinglians (as it pleaseth you to call them) are of one true church, although they differ in one opinion concerning the Sacrament, the one assirming a Reall presence, the other denying it.
               
               The contradiction is easily auoided, by shewing, that the reall presence among a number of thinges in that place rehearsed, may be one chiefe point of religion, and yet not a foundation of our faith. For I say the auncient fathers agree with vs in the chiefe points of religion, and the foundation of our faith, which seeing the Lutherans

hold with vs, the dissent in one chiefe point of religion, can not disseuer them from the Church, and yet they dissent not vnto idolatrie, as the Papists doe. And where Bristow slandereth mee to say, that I count the errors of some of yt latter sort of old fathers (in honoring reliques inuocation of Saints, merits, traditions, vnwritten verities, images of the crosse) to be contrary to the foundation, he is able to shewe no place where I so affirme. And albeit they did so earnestly maintaine some of those errors, that they condemned by their priuate sensure, the contrary truth, for heresies: yet it followeth not that they were heretikes. For it is one thing to hold an error earnestly, an other to holde it obstinatly, so that he is condemned of his owne conscience, when he will not yeeld to the manifest truth plamly proued out of the worde of God.
               40 We knowe that Luther did not obstinately and maliciously erre in any article of faith, concerning the substance of religion. Luther, Caluine, and Bucer, shall come with Christ to iudge the world. As for Illyrians, if you call them of Flaccius Illyricus, they be Lutherans in opinion of the Sacrament, and differ onely in ceremonies, which can not diuide them from the faith. Ar. 10. 61. Pur. 403. Contra: What Flaccius, or any such as he is, hath saide, neither doe I knowe, neither doe I regard, let them aunswere for them selues: But whereas you charge M. Caluine, &amp;c.
               
               Because I knowe not how Illyricus, and such contentious persons as he, expoundeth the annointing in Saint Iames, but referre them to aunswere for them selues, therefore I speake contrary to my selfe, where I say they differ not in faith, from the Lutherans.
               41 There is neuer heresie, but there is as great doubt of the church as of the matter in question. Therefore only the Scripture is the stay of a Christian mans conscience. Ar. 86. Contra: The Church is the 
                        •
                     ay of trueth. If that argument of the Church without triall which is the Church, might take place, it would serue you both for a sword and a bucklar. The church saith it, and we are the church. Therefore it is true. Pur. 367.
               It seemeth Bristowe is beside himselfe, in coyning of contradictions. These words, The Church is the stay of

truth, for which he quoteth Pur. 367. are not mine in that place, but his owne addition: although in other sense I confesse the Church is the stay and piller of truth, not that all is true which is alwaies in the Church, but that truth can not be preserued on earth by the Church.
               42 Among the arguments that Augustine vseth against the Pelagians, one (though the feeblest of an hundred) is, that their heresie was contrarie to the publique praiers of the church. Contra: All other persuasions set aside, hee prouoketh onely to the Scripture, to trie the faith and doctrine of the church, namely in beating downe the schisme of the Donaistes, and the heresie of the Pelagians. Where also he contradicteth him selfe againe, in shewing the reason whie he argued against the Donatistes of only Scripture, but against the Pelagians of the churches praiers also: The Pelagians graunted them to be of the church that so praied. And therefore when Augustine had to doe with the Donatistes that challenged the church vnto them selues, he setteth all other trials aside, and prouoketh onely to the Scriptures.
               Let the readers iudge: for I can not imagine where there be should be so much as the shadowe of a contradiction, gathered out of these wordes, except he meane, that he which prouoketh onely to the scriptures, may not vse an hundreth argumentes out of them, yea or many persuasions beside the scriptures, and yet stand onely vpon the auctority of the scriptures.
               43 We stand for autoritie only to the iudgemēt of the holy scriptures. Pu. 432. Contra: The ground that we haue to persuade vs of ye authoritie of gods booke, is, because we haue most stedfast assurāce of Gods spirit, for the autoritie of that booke, with the testimonie of the true church in alages. The church of Christ hath a iudgement to discerne the word of God, from the writings of men. The primitiue churches testimonie of the word of God we allow and beleeue. You should bring a great preiudice against vs and passing wel prouide for the credit of your cause, &amp; the discredit of ours, if you could bring the consent and practise of the primitiue pure church for the space of a hundreth yeares after Christe, or something out of any Authenticall writer, which liued within one hundred yeares after the Apostles age. Ar. 9. 5. 10. Pur. 364. 331. Ar. 21. 39. 42.
               
                  
The first proposition (as in the place quoted is manifest) is spoken of questions of doctrine: and not of our persuasion of the scriptures to be the word of God. The last sentence, You should bring, &amp;c. being patched out of two places of my booke, Pur. 364. and 331. are not contradictory to the first proposition: for although we stand for auctority onely to iudgement of the holy scriptures, yet we are content to giue you this aduantage against vs, if you can bring any thing out of those eldest writers for Purgatory or prayer for the dead.
               44 Saint Paul 1. Cor. 11. declareth without colour or couerture, the onely right order of ministration. Contra, in the next line: I knowe the Papistes will flee to those wordes of the Apostle, The rest I will set in order when I come. That is manifest to be spoken of matters of externall comelinesse, and therefore (say we) of the order of ministration. Pur. 362.
               In rehearsing my wordes, he leaueth out fiue lines of my saying, betwene the words Couerture, and The onely right, &amp;c. which declare that I speake of the ess
                     •
                  ntiall order of ministration, against Allen which affirmeth oblation of the hoast for the quicke and the dead, both generally and particularly, and a solemne prayer for all departed in Christ, to be necessary parts of the order of ministration of that Sacrament.
               45 The olde Doctors neuer heard Purgatorie named, nor praier for the deade. Pur. 438. Contra: About S. Augustines time, the name of Purgatorie was first inuented. And long afore that also, Montanus had in all points the opiniō of the Papists, &amp;c. Here cap 3 pag 23. And yet againe, Before Chrysostomes time it was but a blinde error without a head. Pur. 356.
               My wordes are of the heresie of Purgatory, and my meaning of those olde Doctors, in comparison of whom Saint Augustine is but a punie, being younger almost by 300. yeares, in whose time although the name of Purgatory were inue
                     •
                  ted, yet the heresie was elder in Montanus. How prayer for the deade came into the Church, it was vncertaine in Chrysostomes time, and therefore I say it was a blinde error without a heade.
               
                  
46 In Saint Augustines time, Sathan was but then laying his foundation of Purgatorie. Pur. 54. Contra: That error of Purgatorie was somewhat rifely budded vp in his time. Pur. 161. And specially here, cap. 3. pag. 14 saying: And this I thinke is the right pedigree of praiers for the dead and Purgatorie, where he putteth the very last generation of it to haue bene in S. Augustines time, and the foundationlong afore Christes time.
               It were a strange contradiction, that could bee picked out of these two allegories, laying the foundation, and rifely budding; seeing the foundation is the beginning of a building, and budding is the first towardnesse of fruite As for the pedigree, is not to the last generation, as Bristow saith, layed in Saint Augustines time, but from the first auctor howe it was continued vnto Saint Augustines time, since which there haue beene many dissents before popish Purgatory were throughly shaped and brought forth.
               47 M. Allen affirmeth that after mens departure, the representation of almes by such as receiued it, shall moue God exceedingly to mercy. O vaine imagination, for which he hath neither Scripture nor Doctor. Pur. 242. 243. Contra: Chrysostome alloweth rather almes that men giue before their death, or bequeath in their Testament, because it is a worke of their owne: than that almes which other men giue for them, howbeit also such almes are auaileable for the dead, he saith. Pur. 236. 237.
               That which Chrysostome speaketh of litle helpe, wil not serue Allen to proue that almes shall moue GOD exceedingly to mercy.
               48 The auncient Doctors did holde the foundation. Contra: cap. 4 pag. 28. He saith, The third Councel of Carthage did define, that it is vnlawfull to pray to God the Some, and GOD the holy Ghost.
               The Councel of Carthage by that decree denied, neither ye person nor office of Christ, nor of the holy Ghost, therefore they held the foundation.
               49 Here cap. 8. he saith, that the iust of the olde Testament went not to Lymbus Patrum after their death, but to heauen immediatly. Contra: The fierie and shaking sword that was set to exclude man from Paradise, was taken away by the death of Christ,

when he opened Paradise, yea the kingdome of heauen (whereof Paradise was but a sacrament) vnto all beleeuers, so, that the penitent theese had passage into Paradise.
               The vertue of Christes death extendeth to the old fathers for their saluation: as much as vnto vs, yet the cause which opened paradise and the kingdome of heauen, was the death of Christ, by Gods ordinance appointed to worke righteousnesse for all the elect, as well before the time of his suffering, as since.
               50 Who so denieth the authoritie of the holy scriptures, thereby bewraieth him selfe to be an heretike. Contra: I say not this (here cap. 9 pag. 170. that Eusebius was not accounted an heretike) to excuse them that doubt of the Epistle of S. Iames. As Martine Luther and Illyricus, for I am persuaded that they are more curious than wise in so doing.
               My words be not alledged truely, in neither of both propositions. In the former they are these, I will not gainesay, but whoso denieth, &amp;c. I doe not alwaies affirme, that I will not gainesay. I may be in doubt. But to graunt that I had affirmed the first proposition absolutely: what contradiction do I make in saying that Eusebius although he affirmed the Epistle of Saint Iames to be a counterfet, was not accounted an heretike? Shall other mens account be ioyned to mine affirmation, to charge me with contradiction? Againe, the former proposition, Who so denieth, &amp;c. If it be affirmed, must be vnderstoode of such as denie the scriptures which are once receiued generally, because they are contrary to his opinion. If he meane the contradiction to be, for that I say: I will not excuse Martine and Illyricus which doubt of the Epistle of Saint Iames, for that I am persuaded they are more curious then wise in so doing: I must tell him, that doubting of the scriptures is not denying them, neither is foolish curiosity like by heresie.
               Last of al, where he chargeth me with falsification of Allens words to auoide a shameful absurditie ensuing of his affirmation, he plaieth his old parts, first in falsifying my words: where I say to reduce, he saith to redeeme: secondly he saith, that Allen speaketh of him that nowe leadeth

a godly life, but will not be reduced to the perfection thereof by repentance, or satisfaction of his lothsome life past. The very words of Allen be these: This our aduersarie, Math. 5. here signifieth our brother, which hath iust quarell against vs in iudgemēt, for yt we would not giue eare vnto him sharply admonishing vs of our faults, being therefore an aduersary to our vices and fleshly conuersation. In which sort to vs that are flesh and bloud, and ready to euill from our youth, all be aduersaries that preach Christ, the amendment of licentious maners, repentance of our lothsome life past, or else vse against vs the rod of correction and bodily punishment, that our soules may be saued in the day of the appearing of our Lord. To this kinde of aduersary Christ counselleth and commandeth vs, for our great good, to agree and consent whiles we be here in the way of this our pilgrimage and transitorie life, least all these meanes which he wrought to reduce vs, to the perfection of a Christian godly life, be as it were, a witnesse of our contempt, and him selfe our accuser before the Iudge, that shall so iustly reward euerie man according to his deedes: that is Christe him selfe, to whome the father hath giuen all iudgement.
               Nowe the wordes in which I reproue this absurditie of Allen, are these. But before we goe any further, let vs see howe the doctrine of this chapter agreeth with yt we had in the chapter next before. There we were told, that Purgatorie serueth but for veniall sinnes, or else for such mortall sinnes, as by forgiuenesse in this life obtained, are made veniall trespasses. But here not onely vices and fleshly conuersation, but also contempt of all that preach Christ, and repentance of our lothsome life past, &amp;c. are saide to be the debt that must be discharged in Purgatorie to the vttermost farthing, then the which no vice is more mortall, nor further from forgiuenesse. For he that not onely leadeth a lothsome life, but also contemneth all those meanes that Christ hath wrought, to reduce him to the perfection of a Christian godly life; (I vse his owne wordes) howe can he haue remission of his sinnes in this life? and yet Maister Allen dare promise

him, that the tolleration of bandes in the prison of Purgatorie, shall recompence his debt, and bring him from thence into the blessed presence of Christ.
            
            
               The twelfth Chapter.
               
                  A nosegaie of certaine strange flowers picked out of Fulke, Bristowe. that they which delight in such a Gardiner, may see his handie worke.
               
               The first flower is that I say, Pur. 283. the sacrifice Fulke. propitiatorie was offered in the lawe onely by the high Priest, once in the yeare. But Bristowe saith, that sacrifice propitiatorie, and for sinne are all one: which sacrifice for sinne was offered, not onely once in the yeare, in the seast of expiation, but also in many other feast dayes, ordinarily and extraordinarily; when so euer any occasion was ministred &amp;c. I knowe not whether I should here accuse his ignorance, or his malice. Which confoundeth that singular sacrifice propitiatorie (vnto which the Apostle compareth the sacrifice of Christes death, Heb. 9) with the often and vsuall sacrifices for sinne, saying they are all one. When that one aboue all the rest is described with such solemnitie, that the high Priest that day onely entreth into the holiest place, that he may offer that holocaustum or the burnt offering, &amp;c. And that it should be an euerlasting ordinance to make an attonement for the children of Israel, for all their sinnes once a yeare. Leuit. 16. Wherefore the other sacrifices for sinne had their vertue of that shadowie or sacramentall propitiation, of this principall sacrifice, which was the most liuely paterne or example of the onely true sacrifice propitiatorie, which our Sauiour Christ offered on ye crosse; once for al: which proportion is obserued by the Apostle, Heb 9. ver. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.. &amp;c. &amp; Heb. 10. ver 11. &amp; 12. But where Bristow saith, beside this one propitiatorie sacrifice, Fulke findeth none, but sacrifices of thankesgiuing in the lawe, he affirmeth that which was neither said of me, nor is truely collected of him. For I saide, that Cyprian in these termes, sacrifice, priest, altar, alludeth to the sacrifices of thankesgiuing

in the lawe, because he vseth also the name of Leuites, by which he calleth Gods ministers. Let Bristowe nowe goe and say, that Leuites also offered sacrifice propitiatori
                     •
                   in the lawe.
               The second flower of mine ignorance is, where to deface the sacrifice of Iudas Macha
                     〈…〉
                  aeus, I say that both the high Priest at that time was a wicked and vngodly man, to wit, either Iason, Menelaus, or Alcimus, and namely Menelaus, the worst of them all three: and also that the other Priestes of that time, were giuen to the practises of the Gentiles, 2. Machab. 4. In so much, that it is like that Iudas Machabaeus, if hee deuised not the sacrifice of his owne heade, yet tooke by imitation of the Gentiles. Frst hee maruelleth, howe I could thinke that Machabaeus had any commnion with the Gentilizers, against whom all his fighting was, seeing it is written first of Macab 4 that he chose priestes without spot, hauing their heart in the lawe of God. I aunswere being such as they were described. 2. Machab. 4. hee had hard choise to finde a sufficient number of vnspotted priestes. But although he were an enimy of gentility, in that corrupt time and state, he might be drawen into imitation of the gentiles in some point that had a shewe of pietie, although it were not agreeable to the lawe of God.
               His next accusation is, that I call them high priestes which were but antipontifices and vsurpers. I aunswere, I iustifie not their title, more then their maners and religion, but whereas by his greekelatine word, he supposeth that there were other true high priestes in their time, he bewraieth his owne grosse ignorance. For whereas he saith that the succession of the true high priestes for that time was this: Onias, Mathathias, Iudas. Ionathas, Simon: The truth is, that Mathathias and Iudas were neuer high priestes, neither doth the Story 1. Macc. 2. or 1. Macc. 3 which he quoteth, shewe any thing to proue that they were: It sayeth that Mathathias was a priest, but not that he was the high priest. And Iosephus who did write an history of the Maccabees, testifieth

plainly that from Iacimus to Ionathan, for 7. yeares there was no high priest, which Ionathan was made high priest in the yeare 160. Ioseph. Antiqu. Lib. 20. Cap. 8. 1. Maccab. Cap. 10. verse 21. which was many yeares after Iudas his brother was slaine. Therefore at such time as Iudas should send the offering to Hierusalem, there was no such good Bishop, as Allen saith: but euen Onias cognomento Menelaus, as Iosephus calleth him, which was depriued both of his life and of his high priesthood at Berytus or as the corrupt story of the Machabes saith, at Berea. 2. Macc. 13. called in the first of the Machabees Bethzetha. But whereas Bristow maketh Ionathas or Simon chiefe priestes in the absence of Iudas, and not Menelaus, he forgetteth that in those expeditions which Iudas made from Hierusalem, for which he quoteth 1. Macc. 4. 5. it is plaine in the same chapter, that Simon was sent with an hoast into Galilee, and Ionathan went with his brother Iudas ouer Iordane into Gilead: which story, how he wil reconcile with the 2. Mac 12. either for time or persons, I haue great meruaile. But that Menelaus, as he was then in office of the high priest, though vnworthy, so that he was at Hierusalem, it appeareth by this record of the time. The Temple was purged (as Bristowe confesseth,) and it is written 1. Macc. 4. Anno 148. in the 25. of the Moneth Cislewe, and in the same yeare Antiochus Eupator by letters sent to Lysias commandeth that the Temple should be restored to the Iewes, whereof Lysias writeth to the Iewes the 24. of the moneth of Iupiter, Corinthus and king Antiochus himselfe, with letters bearing date the 15. of the moneth Panticus sendeth Menelaus to comfort the Iewes. 5. Mac. 11. And ye next yeare after Anno 149. Antiochus came into Iewrie, and did execution vpon Menelaus, and made warre vpon Iudas, &amp;c. 2. Macc. 13. and ordained Iacimus high priest, which continued in that place 3. yeares. Iosep. Antiqu. Lib. 20. cap. 8. If that this account of the second booke of Maccabees, agree not with the story of the first booke, as in deede it doth not, let Bristowe looke 
                     ••
                  to it, that defendeth these bookes to be Canonicall:

it is sufficient for me to iustifie that I cited out of this latter booke, by the report of the same booke: and by Iosephus, who knewe the succession of the high Priestes of his nation, better than Bristowe, whose arrogant ignorance is so much the more odious, that hee would charge me with ouersight, in that hee is most ignorant him selfe: and that against his Maister Allen, who supposeth some other to be high Priest or Bishop, and not Iudas him selfe.
               The third chapter, of my grosse or rather malicious ignorance, is saide to be about Antichrist: As that the Church of Christ should prepare his way, or worke his mysterie. But this is a fable of Bristowe, neuer affirmed by me. As for the other assertions of the time of his reuelation, of the Churches fleeing into the wildernesse, of the time of Antichristes reigne, &amp;c. because they are condemned by the onely authoritie of Bristowe, without any argument or testimonie of Scripture, or Fathers, I will referre the reader to such places, where I affirme any of them, to consider my reasons, and to iudge indifferently.
               The fourth point is, that the body of Christ is not offered to him selfe, but thankesgiuing is offered to him for the offering of his body for vs. Pur. 316. Against this, his reasons are these. Why sir, did not he vpon the crosse offer his owne body as a Man, and a Priest to him selfe as to God? Sir, the Scripture telleth me, that Christ being an high Priest, by his eternall spirite, offered him selfe vnreproueable to GOD: Hebr. 9. verse 14. Ergo, you will say to him selfe as God, because the persons of the godhead are vndiuided. Yet I trust you will distinguish ye humanitie from the deitie, &amp; so Christ offered not his body to him selfe, yt is, neither to his humanitie, nor to ye person of the mediatour, which is God and man. For though God was made man, yet God the Father was not made man, nor God the holy Ghost, but God the Sonne onely. And although it were graunted, that Christ offering him selfe to God, was offered to him selfe, yet it followeth not that men of whome I spake, can offer the body of Christ, yea whole Christ to him selfe,

then the which nothing is more absurd. An other reason Bristow bringeth: that I noted others for saying, it is not lawful to pray to God the sonne. As though it were al one to pray to Christ, &amp; to offer his body to Christ, him self to him self. The fift: That I call it a vaine amplification and fond suppositiō to extend the force of Christes death beyond the limits of his will. My words are of Allens supposition, that the ful force of Christs death would sup vp al sinne &amp; al paine for sinne, death temporall, and eternall, hell, purgatorie, and all paine, &amp;c. But what reasons hath Bristow against my saying? First: my assertion is (saith he) As though it were not of force to worke any whit more than it worketh in acte, as to saue so much as one of them that shal not be saued. I say, it is of force to worke euen as much as God will, but not to worke against the will of God. But I speake contrarie to the expresse scripture. He is the propitiation for our sinnes, and not for our sinnes only, but also for the sinnes of the whole world. 1. Ioh. 2. If you vnderstand the whole world, for euery man in the world, then it foloweth, that God is reconciled for al men, &amp; so no man shall be damned. But S. Iohn meaneth by his general word, al the elect of the world: as when he saith, The whole world is set on mischiefe; he meaneth not euery person, but all the reprobate 1. Ioh. 5. And that Christes death is not a propitiation of the sinnes of al the wicked of the world and reprobates, it is certaine, by that he refuseth to pray for the world, that is, for the reprobates of the world, Iohn 17.
               But Bristowe vrgeth me with mine owne saying, in an other contrarie to this. Concerning the sufficiencie of Christes redemption, there is nothing that can be spoken so magnifically, but that the worthinesse thereof passeth and excelleth it. This should haue come in among the contradictions, if Bristowe had remembred it. But I beseech you sir, in commending the sufficiencie of Christes redemption, doe I extend the force of his death beyond the limits of his will? Are any more redeemed than Christ would?
               The sixt: I say, that to remit sinnes, is proper to his diuinitie. That is (saith Bristowe) as though Christ doth not remit sinnes, according to his humanitie.
                  
I say Christ which is a person consisting of God and man, doth remitte sinnes by absolute auctority, but that is proper to his diuinity and not to his humanity, as for the power which he hath giuen to his ministers, to remit sinne, is not absolute, but to declare remission of sinnes in his name. Neither did the people which glorified God for giuing such power to men Matth. 9. acknowledge the doctrine of the Church for the remission of sinnes by the ministery of man, but praised God for giuing the gift of healing vnto Christ, whom yet as young scholers, they acknowledge not to be God, but an holy Prophet sent of God. And so the other Euangelists report their praising of God to haue beene for that they neuer sawe it so: they had seene wonderfull things that day. Mark. 2. Luk. 5.
               The 7. he chargeth me to teach a pestilent doctrine of desperation, Where I say, there be sinnes for which the Church ought not to pray, euen of men remaining in this life: for which it is not lawfull to pray: which by the mercy of God are not pardonable: it is false, that so long as men are in this worlde, they may repent. For which he quoteth Pur. 274 127. 128. 135. 283.
               After he asketh how many such sinnes there are? and saith in one place I name two, and after more, and after concludeth that in some I say, that it is vnlawful to pray for any wicked person, of what sort so euer his wickednesse be, so long as he continueth in his wickednesse: yea, and it is vnpossible for the wicked but to continue in his wickednesse. This is a pestilent slander, for I neuer accounted any sinne irremisible, but onely the sinne against the holy Ghost: for obstinate and willfull apostasie is ye sinne against the holy Ghost, whereof a fruite is finall contempt of all that preach Christ, and of all meanes that Christ hath wrought to bring vs to repentance, such was the sinne of Saul and of the obstinate Iewes, for whome Samuel and Ieremie are forbidden to pray.
               As for that I should say, it is not lawfull to pray for any wicked person, &amp;c. I neuer thought it, but onely for those that sinne against the holy Ghost, of whom Saint

Iohn saith, they sinne vnto death, and I say not that any man should pray for that. 1. Ioan. 5. Neuerthelesse Bristowe affirmeth, that we are worse then the Nouatians, when I say, That some sinnes neither by the mercy of God are pardonable. But where doe I say so? he quoteth before, Pur 128. And what be my wordes there? Verily who so will turne the booke, shal reade them thus: For by the iustice of God all sinnes are mortall, but by his mercy they are all pardonable, except that sinne vnto death, wherof Iohn speaketh. 1. Ioh. 5. Thus am I worse thā a Nouatian, for saying, ye sinne against the holy Ghost shall neuer be pardoned, neither in this life, nor in the world to come. But perhaps Bristowe will cauill, that euen that sinne is pardonably by Gods mercy, if God would: which is not contrary to that I saide. For I speake of that which may be, Gods eternall will standing, according vnto which the Apostle saith, it is impossible that they which so offende can be renewed by repentaunce. Hebrewes 6.
               The heresie of the Nouatians as Bristowe affirmeth of the report of Aresius their Bishop was: That they who after baptisme, fall into that kinde of sinne. which the holy scriptures call sinne vnto death, ought not to be admitted to receiue the diuine mysteries, but to be exhorted to repentaunce, and to looke for hope of forgiuenesse, not of the Priestes, but of God, who both can and hath authoritie to forgiue sinnes. In which sentence, a double error of the Nouatians is included: first that they tooke that sinne vnto death wherof Saint Iohn speaketh. 1 Iohn. 5. to be falling through frailty in time of persecution, euen as Bristowe doth, the willfull prolapsion and Apostasie that the Apostle speaketh of. Heb. 6. Secondly that they thought the sinne vnto death might be remitted of God, contrary to the manifest denunciation of our Sauiour Christe. Matth. 12. As Bristowe doeth the sinne against the holy Ghoste, which is all one and the same. But that the Catholique Churche did then by her Priestes forgiue all sinnes without accepting the sinne against the holy Ghost, which Bristowe affirmeth out of the confession

of Acesius, I maruell howe he proueth. Yea, he is so impudent to say, that the Protestantes also doe admit all to their Caluines breade, so the blasphemous dogge barketh against the holie Communion: whereas we neuer receiue any whome we knowe to be excommunicated, and much lesse would we receiue any apostata, that is cleane fallen from Christianitie, not of weakenesse or ignorance, but of malicious contempt; or any whome we might knowe to haue sinned that sinne vnto death, and to haue blasphemed against the holie Ghost.
               But nowe let vs see what miserable comfort Bristowe will minister against desperation, in answering such places of scripture, as I brought, to proue the sinne against the holie Ghost to be irremissible.
               First the place of 1. Iohn 5. he saith is meant of them that be deade and damned in hell, as he hath taught vs: cap. 8. but because I refuse that interpretation, as false and newe, he citeth Augustine. in ret. li. 19. cap. 12. whose interpretation at the first was as I holde, but afterward he addeth, if he end his life in this peruersitie. For we must despaire of no man, be he neuer so wicked, so long as he is in this life. Neither is praier made vnwisely for him, who is not despaired of. Here are two contrarie expositions of one man, in which we must consider whether is more proper to the place, and not whether better or last pleased the authour of them.
               That no man is to be despaired of, while he liueth, as it is contrarie to the scripture, so to the practise of the Church, which refused to pray for Iulianus the apostata, and prayed to God against him.
               Maris also the Bishop of Chalcedon, denounced him to his face to be impious, and an apostata, and enimie of God. Socrat. lib. 3. cap. 10. Sozo. lib. 5. cap. 4.
               The second text, Heb. 6. Bristowe expoundeth it of falling through frailtie in persecution, of them which can not be renewed by baptisme, but the Apostle saith expressely by repentance, and therefore speaketh not of lapsion or falling, but of prolapsion or falling cleane away from Christ, with manifest contempt of his grace and redemption.
               
                  
The terrible denuntiation of Christ against the obstinate and malicious Pharisees Matt. 13. Mar. 3. Bristowe faith, he speaketh it not to driue them to desperation, but to moue them to repentance. What if that be graunted, that by shewing the daunger of malitious obstinacie, which groweth to irremissible wickednes, he should admonish them to beware in time, as the Apostle doth, Heb. 6. Doth it therefore followe, that no man sinneth irremissiblie, while he liueth? Although it is plaine, that our sauiour Christ denounceth their damnation as men so obdurate in their wickednes, that nothing could reclay me them, or bring them to repētance. But Bristow would make me contrarie to my selfe, who though in expresse words I count D. Allen &amp; his fellowes such as (by you) Heb. 6. cannot repent, yet do exhort them truly to repent. &amp;c. Pur. 461. But how proueth he, that I count Allen and his fellowes such as cannot repent? Forsooth because I say, they haue sometime beene lightened and tasted of the good gifte of God. Why sir, are all such come to prolapsion? I trow not, In deede I admonish them being in the way of prolapsion, that are curable. Whether Allen were euer a protestant, I know not: but certaine I am, that some of his fellowes haue beene lightned and were protestants, of whom I speake, and not of him. If I say Bristow and his fellowes which are laymen: doe I say Bristow is a lay man? This wilfull &amp; malicious cauilling (Bristow) if you take not heede of it in time, argueth that you are fallen verie deepe, if you be not yet at the bottom of apostasie.
               But this is a cunning cōforter of them that are in desperation, which affirmeth, that Christ doth no otherwise say that such sinne and blasphemie shall not be remitted, then he saith that all other sinne and blasphemie shalbe remitted: and therfore many one, yea, and aboue all number may be and is forgiuen, the sinne against the holy ghost.
               
               He meaneth, because the condition of repentance is not expressed in them that are forgiuen. But if that condition were to be vnderstoode in them also that sin against the holy ghost, what distinction were there for

which he should say? that blasphemie and sinne shall not be forgiuen, neither in this world, nor in ye world to come? Such a sinner hath no remission of sinnes, but is guiltie of eternal damnation. For that none shalbe forgiuen, without repentance, as euerie man knew without that distinction. But Bristow would haue it to be an extraordinary matter for God to forgiue the sinne against the holy ghost, and so he forgaue one of those Pharisees, and he the verie worst of them all: namely S. Paule, who had bin indeede a Pharisee, as he cōfesseth. Act. 23. &amp; 26. but none of those Pharisees: for he knewe not, Christ in the flesh. 2. Cor 5. yea, he had beene a persecuter and a blasphemer, as he confesseth 1. Tim 1. but not the worst of all Pharesees, for he was an elect vessel of God, and his persecution and blasphemie was not of malice or sinne against the holy ghost, but of ignorance and blinde zeale of God: for he addeth immediatly, but I obteined mercie, because I did it ignorantly in vnbeleefe. As for those Pharisees, against whom our Sauiour Christ thundreth that iudgement, did blaspheme the holy ghost against their owne conscience, and knowledge, malitiously attributing vnto the diuell, that which they knew to be the finger of God.
               That which I speake out of Samuel, Ieremie, and Ezekiel, Bristow saith, is all spoken in one sense, of temporall matters, to wit of casting Saule from his kingdome, and the Iewes into captiuitie. But except the persons had bene incurable, God would haue beene intreated to giue them repētance, &amp; to haue continued Saule in his kingdome, and the people in their countrie. The rule that Ezechiel. 33. is vnderstoode of sinnes that are not against the holy ghost, as the examples doe plainely declare.
               The 8. poynt is, that strange interpretation of the creede, (a
                        •
                      he calleth it) Christ descended into hell to redeeme vs out of hell, by suffering the wrath of God for our sinnes. Heb. 5. First Bristow saith, there is neuer a word of that article, and much lesse of the interpretation thereof, in that chapter, yet after to proue that to bee prayer, which I saide was a complaint, as though it might not be be a complayning

prayer, he citeth the 7. verse of the same chapter of Christ, who in the daies of his flesh, with a mightie crie, and with teares, offered vp prayers and supplications to him that was able to saue him, out of death, and was heard from his feare or from that he feared 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . But by this text, Bristow would proue, that Christ was not forsaken of his father, no not corporally, although he complayned, that he was forsaken, as though his lamentable complaint hadbeene more then needed, when he sayde, My God my God, why hast thou forsaken me? which to him that was God, was greater torment of hell, then any heart of man can conceiue. And therefore Bristow, which maketh all to stand in the bodilie death of Christ, and raileth at Caluine for shewing how necessarie it was for Christ, to suffer in soule as much as in body, for the redemption of ye whole man, doth nothing but cauil &amp; slaūder, one while fayning yt Caluine should make two deathes of Christ, another while, yt he was in feare lest he should haue bin dāned for euer &amp;c. Which he saith also shalbe my reply. But when Bristow saith that Christs bodily death without any suffering of his soule was the full redemption of the world, he maketh his tormentes of minde, whereof he complaineth that his soule was heauie vnto death, which made him to sweate bloode before his body was touched, to be of no force, except it were to argue great imbecillitie of Christ, who feared so much bodylie death, that many of his seruantes haue ioyfully imbraced, and that strange crie and teares with which he vttered his prayers on the crosse, and that most lamentable complaint, that God had forsaken him, were for nothing, but for that he was not deliuered from the crosse, (as Bristow writeth) it is too much iniurious to his most bitter passion to imagine, and therefore we must needes acknowledge, that he suffered more in the sight of God, whose iustice he was to satisfie, then he suffered in the sight of men. And so the question that Bristow propoundeth to me, is answered, why descendit ad inferos, cometh after sepultus, because the order of the Symbole is first to shew, what

suffered before men, and then what hesuffered in the sight of God. As for the blasphemy of Theodorus Mopseuestenus that Christ had inclination to sinne, &amp;c. there is no more reason why Bristowe should charge vs with it, then with those other blasphemies, that Christ did dispaire in God, or blaspheme God, or commit some other sinne against God, for our redemption, which he affirmeth to be maintained of some Caluinistes. For which detestable slaunder, if he haue no better ground then he sheweth, let him remember yt the mouth which lyeth killeth the soule. I wil spare to amplifie, though I lack no matter, albeit yt Bristow fayneth mōsters of slaū
                  ders, as Iupiters Giantes, &amp; then casteth thē downe with thūderbolts, deriding myknowledge in amplification.
               The 9. is about the honor of the virgin Marie, wherein first he chargeth me with the heresie of the Heluidians &amp; Antidicomarianites, who were condemned for heretikes for denying her perpetual virginitie; whereas he cometh neerer to the Colliridians, likewise cōdemned, thē we to ye Heluidians. But let vs see his impudent quarels. First I say: As for the perpetuall virginitie of the mother of Christ, as we thinke it is true, so because the scripture hath not reueiled it, neither perteineth it vnto vs, we make no question of it. Here is a great cōiunctiō with heretikes, which trobled ye Church with contention a bout a matter which they were not able to proue by ye scriptures: yet saith Bristow, you forge a principle of onely scripture in their fauour. Surely that principle as it is not forged, so it fauoreth them nothing at al. For their contentious assertion they were not able to proue by the scriptures, but within 4. lines afore, I am contrary to my selfe, where I say all truth may be proued by the scripture. If I had to doe with a man of reason, as I haue to do with a papist, he would vnderstand my propositiō according to the whole matter in controuersie, of such things as are necessarie or profitable for a christian man to know vnto saluatiō. For otherwise I thinke many things to be true, that are not conteined in the scriptures: As I thinke that Bristow lacketh wit, learning, &amp; honesty, thus to quarell which is not written in the scriptures, but gathered

by other reasons: yet he saith, I might wc more honestie haue saide, yt it may be proued by scripture, where she saith, Luk. 1. Because I know no man, that is (saith he) because I haue made a vow of virginitie. A like matter, yt she would marie if she had made a vow of viginitie. Yet Bristow cōfesseth this place proueth not inuincibly her perpetuall virginitie, although it so proue her vow. But if Bristow were condēned, or had vowed to lie in prison vntil he could frame an inuincible argument to proue her vow, out of that place, yea, or any other place of the scriptures, it were all one, as if he were condemned to perpetuall prison or vowed the same.
               Another poynt of that dishonor is, where I controld Allen for excepting the mother of Christ, when he speaketh of sinners, which is all one as if he had said, Christ was not a sauiour of his mother, or that she had no neede of his saluation. And here he chargeth me with reading Caluine more then Augustine, as though Augustine defended the virgin Marie to be free from sinne, because he saith against the Pelagians, that he would haue no question of her for the honour of our Lord, when he speaketh of sinnes. For hereof we know that more grace was giuen to her, to ouercome sinne of all partes, which was worthy to conceiue and bring forth him, 
                        〈…〉
                     om it is certaine that he had no sin, Denat. &amp; grat. 136. It is all one with Bristow, to ouercome sinne, &amp; to be voyde of all sinne. What victorie is there without a battel? if the flesh in ye virgin Marie, did not rebel against ye spirite, what victorie had she by grace? But it is plaine Pelagianisme, to hold that she was voyde of sinne or perfectly righteous. The Pelagian nameth also, ipsam etians domini &amp;c. the verie mother of our Lord and Sauiour, which he saith it is necessarie for godlines, that we confesse that she was with out sinne. But thereof Augustine for ye honour of our Lord will haue no question: signifying that although she were not cleere and exempted from fi
                     〈…〉
                  e, but had grace to ouercome sinne, yet for reuerence of Christ her sonne, he would not reason thereof to bring her within the cōmon cōpasse of al siners. But Bristow perceiueth that I would not haue so answered, seeing I affirme yt by

the reprehension of Christ, Iohn, 2. she did offend, for he would neuer haue reproued his mother without a cause. And said, what haue I to do with thee, woman? except she had intermedled in his office, more then of dutie she ought. But Bristow would colour his reproofe, two wayes: one by false translation of the words 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ? what to me and thee, O woman? not vnderstanding the greek phrase, which is by those words to refuse to haue to doe with one. As the diuels Matt. 8. cried 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ? What haue we to do with thee, Iesus, thou sonne of God, and not as Bristowe translateth, What to vs and thee Iesus &amp;c. But because Bristow saith, that if Christ should meane, that the want of wine perteined neither to him nor to his mother, yet she were not discharged of error, to moue him in a matter, which belongeth neither to him nor her: He sayth, I might doe well to tell him, what were those sinnes of hers. I thinke the answere of Christ sheweth what her offence was here, and Luk. 5. that she presumed to intermeddle vnder colour of her motherly authoritie, with matter apperteining to his diuine office, of being Christ the mediator, with which she had nothing to doe, as a mother, but was esteemed of him as a woman, who knew when it was conuenient for him to doe, whatsoeuer were for the glorie of Gods kingdome, to be done, without her or any other bodies admonition. Neither doe I charge her as Chrysostom in 
                     
                        Ioann. Hom. 20. Optabat. enim. &amp;c. For she wished that he might now winne the fauor of men, and that she might be made more noble by the fauour of her sonne. And perchance she was moued with some humane affection, euen as his brethren, when they saide, shew thy selfe to the world, being desirous by his miracles, to winne themselues a fame. Therefore he answered more sharpely: what haue I to doe with thee, woman? my houre is not yet come. For that he did reuerence his mother, Luke doth testifie, that he was subiect to his parentes, and this Euangelist doth shew, how great care he had of his mother in the time of his passion. For where his parentes did

nothing hinder the mysteries of GOD, did offend nothing, it was meete and necessarie for the sonne to be obedient, neither could he deny obedience without greate perill. Contrarywise, when they desire an vnseasonable thing, and that which would haue beene an hinderance to spirituall thinges. Who is my mother and my brethren? quoth he. For as yet they had not such opinion of him as they ought: but Marie after the manner of mothers, thought she should haue commanded her sonne in all thinges, by her authoritie &amp;c. But the councell of Trent (saith Bristow) sheweth that she had more neede of Christes grace then all other saints, to preserue her from sinne. But in the meane time, she had no neede of his redemption, for the remission of sinne, who was appoynted to saue his people from their sinnes, who came to seeke and to saue that which was lost, both of the house of Israel, and of the Gentiles, so many as attained saluatiō. So therefore howsoeuer Bristow scorneth at my diuinity, I will still conclude that the virgin Mary, beeing so principal a persō of Christs people, was saued from her sinnes, by the redemption of his bloode, was lost, but sought vp, and saued by him. Which diuinitie being taken out of the scriptures, I trust is more commendable, then the contrarie doctrine deriued from the Pelagians, and defended by the Papistes.
               The 10. poynt of mine ignorance is, about the definition of an heretike, whom I saide to be a man in the Church. I haue shewed before, that I distinguish betweene him that is in the Church, and him that is of the Church; a Papiste, an Anabaptist, may be in the Church, but they cannot be of the Church, except they repent. Where I added vnto my definitiō, that if any of vs can be proued obstinately to mainteine our opinion, contrarie to the doctrine of the scriptures, we refuse not to be counted heretikes. Bristow saith, they may say the like. But the triall is all. Bristow saith, they bring plaine scriptures to proue that all the doctrine of the Apostles traditions, is the doctrine of

the scriptures. And we say the same, that whatsoeuer the Apostles deliuered in speech, they deliuered also in writing, and neither contrarie to other. But that all true doctrine necessarie to saluation, is not conteined in the scriptures, that you proue not, neither that such things were of the Apostles deliuerie, as you call traditions of the Apostles. As for the particular poyntes you prate of, concerning the time of the Churches persecution, and Antichristes raigne, haue beene answered in their proper places. The wordes of Christ, This is my body: we acknowledge to be true, in such sense as he spake them, neither can you prooue that they importe your carnall Carpernaiticall presence, what you hold of Iustification by workes, Worshipping of Images, Insufficiencie of Christes redemption, Impeccabilitie of Marie &amp;c. contrarie to the expresse and plaine textes of the scripture, it were out of place here o make rehersall.
               The 11. is mine ignorance in wondring at Allen for saying, that a christian scholer should first beleeue, and after seeke for vnderstāding, he hath noted cap 10. Dem. 34. and there haue I answered.
               The 12. poynt proceedeth of like ignorance, where I am said to wonder, when I heare that the sacrifice of the masse is a likenesse of the sacrifice of Christs death vpon the crosse. And then I am asked whether I know not that sacramentes are not likenesses of other thinges: and Augustine is called to witnesse, with much adoe, as though it is all one to haue sacramentes which are similitudes of Christs death, and to haue a sacrifice of similitude or likenesse, which I saide truly was contrary to the whole scope of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, that there should be any shadowes or resemblances, when the body and substance it selfe is come: which I spake, supposing that Allen by likenes of the exemplar, meaneth the masse with all the apish pageants thereof, to be like the sacrifice of Christes death. And indeede it was that monstruous saying of Allen, which I wondered at. By likenesse of ye 
                  exemplar (as indeede being in an other maner the verie selfesame.
                  
But Bristow setting a good countenance, vpon so great an absurditie, asketh what boy hath not hearde it saide, of one &amp; the same man being changed by age, sicknesse, apparel, shauing, &amp;c. he is like or vnlike himselfe? But tontrariewise, what boy in Oxford or Cambridge, would not reply, that this similitude or likenesse or vnlikenesse, is of two seuerall shapes, and not of one and the same substance vnto it selfe: as Allen saith, the sacrament is like the body of Christ, and is the very same in another maner that is vnder couerture of accidentes that belong to another kinde of substance. But Bristowe is not so quicke to vnderstand me where I vnderstand not my selfe as he weeneth, where I say: neither will it helpe, that Allen saith, it is the selfesame in another manner, so longe as the same respect remaineth: I am sorie that Bristowe is so dull headed, that he cannot vnderstand, what the same respecte meaneth in opposition, which if it not obserued in the thinges opposed, they are not alwayes opposite, and specially relatiues who hange altogether vpon respect. But Bristowe asketh who can imagine, that the verie same respecte remaineth, when the same manner doth not remaine?
               Why sir? what is the respect of the likenesse of the sacrifice of the masse, with the exemplar? seeing you confesse the manner tobe vnlike, but the verie identitie of the thing sacrificed, which is the monster that I maruaile at: as also that you cannot imagine the same respect, where there is not the same manner. Is not God, the father of our Lord Christ, in the same respect that Abraham is the father of Isaak, but yet after a farre other manner? yea, to follow your owne wise examples, is not Abraham father of Isaak in the same respecte, when Isaak is yonge, and when he is olde; when he is cloathed, and when he is naked; when he is shauen, and when he was bearded; when he is sicke, and when he is whole? Such are the manners in which you houlde that the sacrifice

of the masse, is the same after another manner.
               The 13. is where I attribute to diuorsement, which the scripture in many places doth deny to diuorsement, and doth attribute onely to death. What is it? to make her no wife, that was a wife. Verily diuorsement for adulterie maketh her no wife, that was a wife, as is gathered euen by those textes of scriptures which Bristowe quoteth Matt. 5. &amp; 19. Mark. 10. &amp;c. where the exception of fornication, maketh the case to be the same that was vsed by permission of the lawe, in diuorsementes, and mariage after diuorsementes. But Bristowe saith, I vtter herein my skil, in many thinges. As in saying that mariage after diuorsements is dispensed with all by the Pope. And doe I not say true, although the Popes law denyeth such mariage to be lawfull? Are there not many examples of such dispensations?
               Secondly I say, that the Popes canon lawe hath farre many more causes of diuorsement then for adulterie. Bristow distinguisheth the perpetuall diuorse, for adulterie, where the innocent partie cannot be compelled to receiue the guiltie partie, although he become neuer so chast; and separation, where the furie of a man is so great, that the wife is in danger of her life: asking if we doe not allow her to dwell away from him vntill he be amended: No verily, but we would compell him to lie in prison from her, vntill his amendement might sufficiently appeare. But what saith your lawe, concerning frigiditie, concerning error in the condition of the person, as if she marie a man which is bond, whō she supposed to haue beene free &amp;c. Doth not your lawe allow diuorsements perpetuall in such cases? But where I wish that adulterers might be punished with death, first he quarelleth, as though I held that the Iudiciall lawe were stil to be obserued: as though it be not free in such poyntes, as it is conuenient for other common welthes to receiue it, albeit, it is not necessarie. Secondly he houldeth that a man was not punished by death, if he sinned against his wife with a single woman. Where as the case is expresly of a single man, lying with another
'

mans wife, or of one that was betroathed to another man, which must needes be all one, of a maried man lying with a single woman. Leuit. 20. and Deut. 22. And yet he noteth mine ignorance of the lawe: because I charge the Papistes to allow dispensation for such persons to marie, as the lawe of God and nature abhorreth. Then he asketh me, what lawe of God do I meane? but Leu. 18? and whether I thinke that law to binde Christians? Yea verily, for the sense of nature abhorreth all those forbidden coniunctions. What else moued the heathen Romanes to make lawes euen of the same? But Bristow bringeth in Gods dispensation in the old Testament, which is false: for after the propagation of mankinde, for which it was of necessitie allowed, it can neuer be proued that God allowed any one of those mariages forbidden. 18.
               But the Pope dispenseth not onely with marying of the brothers wife in affinitie, but euen with the Vncle to marie his Neece, in consanguinitie, as we see in the mariage of King Philippe of Spaine in our daies.
               The 14. after such ignorance in Gods lawe discouered, Bristow marueileth not if I be ignorant in the Popishe Churches lawe and diuinitie, in making it a certaine thing, that the Pope giueth his pardons by the sacrament of penance. Athough it be no great shame for me to professe mine ignorance in many of the popes lawes &amp; some part of his diuinitie: yet herein Bristow doth me wrong, to charge me to say absolutely, that ye Pope giueth his pardons by the sacramēt of penance. As though the Pope being at Rome, might minister a sacrament to one in England. And that so great a D. doth not trowe that the power of binding and loosing is exercised many other wayes besides that sacrament. Seeing the Master of ye sentences cōprehendeth vnder the title of the sacrament of penance, al that power or what soeuer he can enquire or define of it Lib. 4. Dist. 14. 15. 16. 17. But if sins may be forgiuē in popery without repentance, &amp; that ye Popes pardons require no repentāce in them that should take ye
                  
benifite of them, it is one poynt of poperie that I am content to confesse that I haue learned of Bristow.
               The 15. poynt is, that I am ignorant in our own diuinity, because I wonder that a Papist should say, that God sometime punisheth sinne with sinne, and complaine that when we say, but halfe somuch, they chardge vs to make God the auctor of sinne. For Bristowe asketh, if it be not a cōmon position &amp; large discourses vpō it in our masters bookes, that God is the author of sinne? O impudent and malitious lyer, hast thou read those bookes of Caluine Insti. lib. 1. cap. 17. 18. &amp; Melancthō. ad Rom. which thou quotest, and darest thou for shame of the world, if thou haue no feare of God, to charge them with holding such a blasphemous positiō, when they in the same bookes doe refute it, as an horrible slaunder which they neuer thought of: but alwayes affirmed that God as a righteous iudge, not as an euill author Ioseth Satan, and vseth his ministerie for the punishmēt of sin &amp; sinners, and for the trial and amendment of his children as in Dauid &amp; Iob? As for those blasphemies that God worketh sinne in vs by himselfe, willing, appoynting, and predestinating vs to sin, no lesse thē he, which leadeth a blind man out of his way &amp;c. are nothing else but Bristowes lies &amp; slanders alwaies detested of those godly writers, &amp; of all them that truly professe and imbrace the Gospel.
               The 16. poynt is of mine ignorance in histories ecclesiastical, as of the celebration of Easter by the Britons and Grecians, noted before and answered. Secondly because I say (as it seemeth) that Iulianus the Apostata was Emperour after Valens the Arrian. Surely where I learned that he was a persecutor of the Church, I might haue learned the time of his Emipre, that he was next to Cōstantius, &amp; after him Iouianus, Valentinianus, &amp; Valens, &amp; sure I am that I learned it out of Carions Chronicle 30. yeares agoe. Which being so vulgar a matter, I thought none had beene so malicious to charge me with ignorance therof. But indeede he chargeth me very iniuriously, for when I say after that when Iulianus the Apostata was Emperour, I meane to shewe how persecution and Gentility was restored after that Constantine had giuen

peace, beside the trouble of heresie which was in the time of Constantius and Constans, to whom I ioined Valens, as agreeing in that same heresie of Arrianisme. Againe where I saide, the newe Testament is printed in the Syrian tongue at the Emperors charges, for the encrease of Christian faith among them: Bristowe asketh me, what Emperor, or what faith, but Catholike or Popish? That which I saide of the Syrian Testament, was to shewe that the Churches in Chaldea haue preserued the scriptures, which yet are not subiect to the Church of Rome; with the Emperors profession I delt not, but his purpose I suppose, was to encrease Christian faith, and I am persuaded the reading of the scriptures in the mother tongue will not encrease Popish faith, seeing Papists are so vnwilling, that the people should read the worde of God in the natiue language.
               Fourthly that I say the fathers alledging the succession of Bishops against heretikes, specially named the Church of Rome, because those heretikes for ye most part had ben somtimes of ye Church of Rome, as Valentinus, Marciō, Nouatus. Against this Bristowe telleth me, yt Allen speaketh also of the Arrians, Donatists, and al heretikes. But I spake of those fathers, that alledged the succession of Bishops, namely Irenaeus, Tertullian and Cyprian. Irenaeus testifieth of Valentinus, Cerdon and Marcion, that they were at Rome vnder Hyginus, Pius, and Anicetus, and that Cerdon came often into the Church and made his confession, and yet taught his heresie priuily and was excommunicated. For Nouatus that he was a Prieste of the Church of Rome, Eusebius is cleare. Lib. 6. Cap. 42. But Cyprian calleth him Nouatianus, whereas Nouatus had beene of Carthage, but from thence was also gone to Rome. I deny not but the similitude of the names might cause the Greeke writers to be deceiued, as Bristowe saith, and it may be that the name of Nouatianus in Cyprian is corrupted for Nouatus, and the other called Nouatus in steade of Nauatus, which name was then in vse. But seeing the person of the heretike is certaine, it is folly to striue for his

name, I haue shewed mine authour for Nouatus 
                     〈◊〉
                   Rome, and so for the rest: wherefore I haue not bewraied any ignorance therein, as Bristowe pretendeth.
               The 17. and last point of mine ignorance is, where I shewe, wherein the communion of Saintes consisteth: In that I say, one can not merit for an other, no not for him selfe, but euery man hath his worthinesse of Christe. As though (saith Bristowe) neither Christ could merite for any other, no nor for him selfe, because he had his worthinesse of God. But I say that Christ, because he was God, had his worthinesse of him selfe, and therefore did merite for vs. And see what secret blasphemie is contained in this comparison of Bristowe: Where he would make a similitude of meriting betweene vs which please not God, but onely through his mercy; with Christe, who satisfied the iustice of God. But Bristowe chargeth me so to define the cōmunion of Saints, that I allow no place for the praiers of ye members aliue, made for others yt are aliue. A vile slander, when I speake of the grace and giftes of God, which as euery one hath receiued of God, so of charitie he is bound to imploy the same to the profite of his fellowe members here on earth. But if we be bound of charitie to pray one for an other (saith Bristowe) whie are not these members in heauen as well? Because there is not a lawe appointed for them that are in heauen, and them that be in earth, we knowe praier is commaunded vs, we knowe not any praier commaunded them: neither are we to trust to any such thing. But the Scripture saith, that Christes friendes doe reioice in heauen with his penitents in earth, It saith so in deede of the Angels, and I doubt not of the like affection of the blessed spirites, but of their knowledge: and if their knowledge were certaine, yet it followeth not, that they pray for the conuersion of sinners: and much lesse that the mutuall offices of loue, whereby one member hath compassion with an other, can by any meanes touch the state of the deade, to receiue any benefite thereby. But an other quarrell is, where I make the communion of the whole body, to be the participation of life from Christ the head. If this be all (saith Bristow)

then there is no communion. For what communion were it betweene the members of your naturall body, if they did onely receiue life from your head, and could not vse the saide life to profite one an other? &amp;c. This man hath great leasure to trifle without any matter. Who so shall reade my wordes, Pur. 199. which he quoteth, shall finde me to say, That the communion of the whole body, is the participation of life, and all other offices of life that euery member and the whole body hath of the head, as S. Paule teacheth plainely. Ephes 4. If it be any office of a Christian life, for one member to assist an other in that it may, and as it ought, I haue comprehended it, but that Bristowe doth wilfully holde my saying, and then play with it at his pleasure. Yet he chargeth me with belying of Allen: that he will haue other workes &amp; waies of saluation, besides ye bloud of Christ, because he groundeth all works and waies of saluation in the bloud of Christ. But I reporting his words truly, by plain distribution do gather, that Allen will haue other workes and waies of saluation beside the bloud of Christ: except you will say, that is no way nor worke of saluation of it selfe, without these waies and works of men. If the bloud of Christ of it selfe be one way and worke of saluation: and there be other waies and workes, though grounded in it, then are there more waies and workes of saluation, than the onely redemption of Christe, which I vnderstand by the bloud of Christ, so I haue done Allen no iniurie, but he hath offered hainous iniurie to the bloud of Christe, and so doe al they which mixed it with any to purchase Gods fauour, who is reconciled by none other merite or satisfaction, but only by the bloud of the crosse of his Sonne our Lorde Iesus Christe, to whome be praise for euer more.
               In the thirtienth chapter or conclusion, Bristowe doth only shew, yt there is in my two bookes stuffe ynough to make an other booke as bigge as this, to the discredit of my partie. I trust this booke of his, as bigge as it is, hath wrought no discredite to the cause I maintaine, because I haue shewed howe it is stuffed with lies, slaunders, falsifications, and cauillations; such stuffe he may haue great

store in the diuell his maisters schoole, to make a booke tenne times as bigge as this was: but for so much as he hath not aunswered any one of mine arguments, or refelled any one of mine aunsweres to Allen, in any right order, leauing the defence of him (as he pretendeth to defend the Church, I confesse he hath left matter sufficient, for any man, that will vndertake the confutation of my bookes (which this his vnorderly and vnsufficient replie, notwithstanding) I protest to remaine still in their strength and vnanswered.

                  THese notes and sentences, D. S. hath set Fulke. before his booke, as the pith and martowe of all his treatise. In which, as he pleaseth him self not a litle, so he sheweth nothing, but his ignorance, vanitie, and falshood. His ignorance in the interpretation of the Hebrue wordes: Man Hu, which doe signifie, This is a readie meate, prepared without mans labor, as euen, the author of the booke of Wisedome expoūdeth it. Which Sāder readeth interrogatiuely, folowing the errour of some olde writers, which could put no difference betweene the Hebrue, and the Chaldee tongs.

For Man in Hebrewe signifieth not what, neither doth the Chaldee Paraphrase expound it so, but Manna hu, that is, This is Manna, that is to say, a ready meate. Againe, he sheweth him selfe ignorant in the Apostles doctrine, when he maketh Manna a figure of the sacrament, which the Apostle plainely affirmeth to haue bene the same spirituall meate, which the sacrament is to vs. 1. Cor. 10. His vanitie appeareth, that when he can racke neuer a saying of the Prophetes to his purpose, he dreameth of a prophecie in the Prouerbes of Salomon, which booke was neuer accounted of wise men for propheticall, but doctrinall: and this pretended prophecie is an allegorical exhortation of wisdome to imbrace her doctrine, and not a prophecie of Christ instituting his sacrament: an inuiting of men in Salomons time, and all times, to studie wisedome, and not a foreshewing of a supper to be ordained by Christ in time to come. In the words which he alledgeth, for the promise of the sacrament, is discouered a manifest falsification of the text of Scripture, to peruert the meaning of Christe, which is of his passion, vnto the institution of the sacrament thereof. For the wordes of our Sauiour Christ, Ioh. 6. 51. are these: And the breade which I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world. These last words (which I will giue) Sander hath fraudulently omitted, yt this promise might seeme to be referred, not vnto the passion of Christ, in which he gaue his flesh for the life of ye world, but vnto the giuing of the sacrament of his flesh, in his last supper.
               In the title of performance, he omitteth to shewe, what Christ gaue: when he saide, This is my body, that he might seeme to haue giuen nothing but his body, whereas the Euangelistes teach, that he brake and gaue the breade, which he tooke, affirming it to be his body. The doctrine of the Apostles Sander doth not holde, because he neither breaketh breade, which he denieth to be in the sacrament, nor acknowledgeth a communicating or participation of the Lordes body, which he alloweth to be receiued of the reprobate, which haue no

communicating or partaking with Christ. So that he denieth the sacrament, or outward signe to all men, and giueth the heauenly matter or thing signified by the sacrament, euen vnto wicked men. The beleefe of the Church which Hilarie professeth, Sander maintaineth not: for Hilarie saith, that we do truely eat the flesh of the body of Christ, sub mysterio vnder a mysterie, &amp; per hoc vnum erimus, and by this we shal be one with him and the father, which can not be vnderstoode of the Popish corporall receiuing.
               Last of all, he followeth the custome of heretikes, which is to draw mens sayings inio a wrong meaning, for Tertullian in the place by him alledged, speaketh not of such heretikes, as pretended a figure in the sacrament, where none should be acknowledged, but he him selfe, by that the breade is a figure of the body of Christ, proueth against Marcion the heretike, that Christ had a true body. ad Marc. lib. 4.
               
                  To the body and blood of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, vnder the Sander. formes of bread and wine, all honor, praise, and thankes be giuen for euer.
                  I Can not tell whether I should complaine more of the Fulke. vanitie, or blasphemy of this dedicatorie Epistle: the forme whereof being so newe and strange, that the like was neuer heard of in the Church of Christ, euery word almost containeth a great and grosse heresie. For not content to make the sacrament the very naturall body and blood of Christ, he maketh it the very essentiall deity it selfe. For vnto whom is all honor and glory dewe, but vnto God himselfe? Againe, seeing he ioineth not the persons of God the Father and of God the holy Ghost in participation of the praise, by this forme of greeting he doth either exclude them; or if he will comprehend them, for that inseparable vnity which they haue with the godhead of Christ, he bringeth forth an horrible monster of heresie, that God the father and God the holy Ghost, is with the body and bloud of Christ, vnder

the formes of breade and wine. Much like the Sabellians and Patripassians, which affirmed that God the father was borne of the virgine Marie, and was crucified as well as God the Sonne. Euen so Sander by this blasphemous and heretical epistle, if he denie not honor, glorie, power, and presence euery where vnto the Father, and the holie Ghost, yet comprehendeth them with GOD the Sonne, and God the Sonne with his body and bloud, vnder the formes of bread and wine. For thus he writeth: I adore thee my God and Lord, really present vnder the formes of breade and wine. To which also he saith: And to whom should I referre the praise and thankes for it, but vnto thee alone? Or of whome should I craue the protection thereof, but of thee? seeing thou onely art a meete patron for the defence of any booke, which only art alwaies present, wheresoeuer and whensoeuer it shall be examined. To the honour therefore of thy body and bloud, I offer this poore mite &amp;c.
                  
                  By these wordes you see, that Sander acknowledgeth no GOD, nor Lorde, but him that is really present vnder the formes of breade and wine: except hee acknowledge more Gods and Lordes than one. And consequently, yt either he acknowledgeth not God the Father, and God the holie Ghost, or else he acknowledgeth him present vnder the formes of breade and wine, without distinction of persons, and with a blasphemous confusion of the substance of the two natures in Christ. For the figure called the Communication of speaches can not helpe him in this case, seeing he wil admit no figure, but a most proper speach in these wordes: This is my bodie. Whereas it is euident to all men, that are not obstinately blinde, that if Christe had purposed to make the sacrament really and essentially all that him selfe is, and would haue declared the same in proper speach, he would not haue saide: This is my bodie, and this is my bloud, which is but a part of him, and the lowest part of him; but he would haue saide, take, eate, this is Iesus Christ, or this is al yt I am. But when he saith: this is my body, &amp; this is my bloud (which if it be not a

figuratiue speach, should be a dead bodie and a senselesse bloud) he sheweth manifestly, that he commendeth not a meta physicall transmutation of the elements into his naturall flesh and bloud: but an heauenly and diuine mysterie, teaching vs and assuring vs that God the sonne being ioined with vs in the nature of his humanitie, which he hath taken vnto him, by the spirituall vertue of his body broken and bloud shed for vs on the crosse, doth wonderfully feede vs and nourish vs, as it were with meate and drinke, vnto eternall saluation, both of body and soule. If any man think that I referre the words of Sander, to the Sacrament, which he speaketh of the diuinitie of Christ generally, let him reade the whole Epistle, and comparing it with the title of salutation which I haue set downe in his owne wordes, consider whether Sander, professing that he speaketh therein to the bodie and blood of Christ vnder the formes of breade and wine, can be reasonably vnderstoode of Christ, after any other sorte then vnder the formes of breade and wine. Wherefore such bolde speaches as he vseth in this dedication, tending to so grosse heresie, were a declaration of his proude stomake, nowe broken foorth into hainous treason against his owne countrie, and actuall rebellion against his souereigne and natural Prince.
                  But thou O Lord Iesus Christ our onely Sauiour and Redeemer, whome we adore and worship, as our King and God, not vnder the accidentall shapes of breade and wine, but aboue all principalities and powers, sitting on the throne of magnificence of God thy eternall father in heauen, to whom with thee and ye holie Ghost, we giue al honor &amp; praise for euer, vouchsafe (if it be thy holy wil) to conuert these enemies of thy maiestie, vnto ye true vnderstanding of thy blessed word, or if their obstinate resisting of thy spirit, so require, shewe forth thy glorious might in their speedie ouerthrowe and confusion, that we thy humble seruantes, beholding thy wonderfull iudgementes, may laude and magnifie thy holy name,

as well in the saluation of thine elect, as in the destruction of thine enemies, to thine euerlasting praise and renoune for euer and euer.
                  
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     The preface to the Christian reader. Sander.
                     
                     THe proposition of this painted preface, is yt the scriptures Fulke. must be expounded according to the greatest auctority that may be founde in that kinde, which Sander assumeth to be the vse, custome and practise of the Catholike Church. This assumption is false, although if it were true, it helpeth the Papistes nothing at all, which can not shewe the practise of the Catholique Church of all times, for any error, which they maintaine against vs. The greatest auctoritie in expounding of the scriptures, is of the holy Ghost, whose iudgemenr can not be certainly founde, but in the scriptures them selues: wherefore conference of the holy scriptures of God, is of greater auctority then ye practise of men. The scriptures inspired of God, are able to make vs wise vnto saluation, they are sufficient to make the man of God perfect prepared to all good workes. 2. Tim. 3. Wherfore the practise and custome of Gods people, must be examined by the scriptures, and not the scriptures expounded after it. Exposition of the scriptures or prophesying must be according to the analogic of faith. Rom. 12. But faith is builded vpon the worde of God, and not vpon the custome of men: therefore exposition of the scriptures, must be according to the word of God, and not after the vsage of men.
                     The example which Sander vseth, to confirme his false assumption, is of baptising of infants of Christians, before they be taught, which doctrine he denieth to be proued by the order of Christes wordes, Matth. 28. but by the vse and consent of all nations. To this I aunswere, that the vse and consent of all nations, were not sufficient to warrant the baptisme of infants of the faithfull, except the same were warranted by the Scriptures in other places: As is manifest in the institution of circumcision.

According to the couenant whereof, the Apostle saith, that all our fathers were baptized in the clowde and in the sea, 1. Cor. 10. and the children of the faithfull are holy, therefore to be admitted to baptisme, 1. Cor. 7. because they are comprehended in Gods couenant, according to which scriptures they are baptized, &amp; the infants of Iewes or Gentiles refused, and not onely vpon the ground of the Churches custome and vse therin (as Sander affirmeth,) which custome is good, because it is grounded vpon the Scriptures, but the scripture is not authorized by that custome. Wherefore popish confirmation, and adoration of the bodye of Christ in the sacrament, (although he falsely affirmeth, that they are the like custome of the Catholike Church) are Iewde and vngodly practises of the Papistes, because they are not warranted by the holy scriptures, but are proued contrarie to the same.
                     But whereas we alledge the iudgement of the fathers of the Church, for sixe hundred yeres after Christ, to be against transubstantiation and adoration: Sander replyeth, that things vncertein, must be iudged by things certeine, and not contrariwise. This principle is true: but it is false, that the iudgement of the fathers in the first sixe hundred yeres is vncerteine: as also, that those foure certeinties which he rehearseth, be either all certeinties, or certeinly on his side. The first is the wordes of the scripture, This is my body: about whose vnderstanding is all the controuersie, and therefore no certeintie that they are on their side, more then these words are certeine on our side against transubstantiation. The breade which we breake, &amp;c. so often as ye eate of this bread, &amp;c. The second is false, that in the Catholike church, all men worshipped the reall bodie of Christe vnder the formes of bread, &amp;c. for it is the practise onely of the Popish Church, and that but of late yeres, neuer admitted by the Orientall churches, beside many churches and members of Christes Church in the West, that euer did abhorre it. Thirdly, the Councell of Laterane, kept 350. yeres past, was no generall Councell of

all that professe Christianity, but only of the Papistes: no more was any that followed, at Constance, Basil, Trent, nor yet that of Florence, in which, although there were some Grecians, yet the councell of Basil, was against it, and many Orientall Churches, that were neuer called to it, neither was there any thing for transubstantiatiō, or adoration, therein agreed by the Grecians, that were there.
                     For in the last session it is thus recorded: 
                           Quibus quidem quatuor quaestionibus dissolutis, summus pontifex petiit, vt de diuina panis transmutatione, quae quidem quarta quaestis fui
                                 •
                               in Synodo, ageretur. At Graeci dixerunt, se sine totius orientalis Ecclesiae▪ 
                              
                                 •
                              auctoritate quaestionem aliam tractare non posse, cùm pro illa tant
                                 •
                              m de spiritus sancti processione Synodus conuocata fuerit. Which foure questions, beeing dissolued, the Pope desired, that of the diuine transmutation of the bread, which was the fourth matter in controuersie, it might bee treated in the synode. But the Grecians sayed, that they without the authoritie of the whole Oriental▪ Church coulde handle none other question, seeing the synode was called together, for that only question, of the proceeding of the holy Ghost.
                     
                     Fourthly, although Berengarius, was condemned by three Popish councels, and by many learned preachers of his time thought to be an heretike, yet seeing his doctrine is agreeable to the Scriptures, and the iudgement of all the auncient Church, for sixe hundred yeares and more, after Christ, and was also receiued by diuers learned preachers in his time, the same being nowe taught in England, is true doctrine, and no heresie. Wherefore, none of the foure certeinties, are certeine and true on Sanders side. But he will examine vs, what Gospell, what Church, what councels we haue.
                     First he saith we can bring no Gospel, where it is writen, This is the figure of my body: Neither doe we affirme,

that it is onely a figure of his body, nor denye that it is his body, after a certeine manner, as Augustine sayth. And Sander will not deny, but that it is a figure, which were not true, except it were proued out of the Gospell, which speaking of the Cuppe, sayth: This is the newe Testament in my bloud. And what Gospell doeth Sander bring? saying, This bread is turned into my body.
                     To the seconde demaunde, I answere: The primitiue Churche, for sixe hundred yeares, did beleeue of the presence of Christ in the sacrament, as wee doe, during which time, as there was no controuersie, so there needed no generall Councell to be gathered for confirming of that doctrine.
                     As there are many other articles agreed on both partes, which were neuer decreed in generall Councels: because there neuer was question about them. But when the question did arise, it was in the time of the prophecyed defection, from Christ vnto Antichrist, and the true Church was miserably oppressed and dispersed, so that no generall Councell could bee gathered about it, neither yet can, by meanes of the ciuill dissention betweene Princes that professe Christ, and the tyrannie of heathen Princes, which holde many partes of the Church in miserable captiuitie and slauerie.
                     But the first sixe hundred yeares (saith Sander) make not for the Sacraments, which is declared inuincibly, by three meanes: First, diuerse fathers require vs instantly to beleeue these wordes, This is my body, &amp;c. although they seeme to bee against naturall reason and sense. And yet no wise man will require vs to beleeue figuratiue wordes.
                     
                     O shamelesse and senselesse heretike! will not euery wise man require vs to beleeue all the figuratiue wordes of holy Scripture? Are not these wordes true, although they be contrarie to naturall reason &amp; sense?

The rocke was Christ, I am the true vine, I am the doore, &amp;c? and if these wordes are true, are they not to be beleeued of vs, in their true meaning? euen so these wordes: This is my body: are true in their meaning, and therefore credite is worthily required to be giuen vnto them. The seconde reason is, that the same fathers teache expressely, that adoration of the body and blood in the mysteries, which is a lowd lye, vnderstanding it of popish adoration. The third reason is, because the fathers teache, that we are made naturally and corporally one flesh with the flesh of Christ, in the worthie receiuing of the blessed sacrament. But this is false: for they teach that the sacrament is an argument as a signe, of our naturall and corporall coniunction with Christ, which is by his incarnation: for our coniunction by the sacrament, is neither naturall, nor corporall, but spirituall vnto the body and bloud of Christ crucified for vs. Wherefore these reasons notwithstanding, the sixe hundred yeres make still for vs. Yet can wee not assure our selues of the first sixe hundred yeres (sayeth Sander) by the writings of the fathers of those times, because none of them goeth about to prooue, that the body of Christ is not vnder that, which the Priest blesseth, &amp;c. or warned the people to beware of idolatrie, or haue vsed such wordes, as the Sacramentaries do now vse. If Sander had not in him more impudencie then learning, hee woulde not reason from authoritie negatiuely, although his negatiues are not all true. For some of the olde writers deny in expresse wordes, the sacrament to be the very body of Christ: Aug. in Psa. 98. Chrysost. in Math. That they warned not men to beware of idolatrie in worshipping the sacrament, it argueth, that none in their time did worship it, seeing you Papistes confesse, that idolatrie may bee committed in worshipping the Masse cake, if it be not consecrated, and therefore teach men to worship it, with this condition, when they see it, if it be consecrated. Such wordes as the fathers vsed in explication of the mysterie, we
                           •
                         vse when we teache, that it is a figure, a token, a representation,

a signification, a similitude, a symbole, a type of the body and bloud of Christ; and what wordes soeuer wee vse, wee vtter none contrary to their meaning, and teaching, of the holy sacrament. But (saith Sander) that they call the sacrament a figure or holy signe, it hindereth not the reall presence, because signes instituted by Christ, haue reall trueth in euery sacrament. Neither doe wee say the contrarie, but that the reall trueth of Christes body, is giuen vnto vs in the sacrament of the supper, euen as the holy Ghost is giuen vs in the sacrament of baptisme, and yet we deny the breade which is the signe, to bee turned into the naturall bodye of Christ, euen as we deny the water, which is likewise the signe, to be conuerted into the substance of the holy Ghost. But the fathers (saith Sander) are not against the doctrine of the Papistes, because no Papist findeth fault with them. By the same reason, he might proue, that none of the Iurie which haue found a theefe guiltie, did goe against him, because the theefe challenged none of them. And yet Gardener &amp; others challenge Theodoret &amp; Gelasius. Againe he sayth, The fathers are against the Protestants, because they excuse Hilarie, Chrysost. Cyrill, by the figure of Hyperbole, which is a Rhetoricall lye, but in deede, this argument is a lewde lye, of one which knoweth neither Logike, nor Rhetorike, but like a young smatterer, or a sophisticall cauiller. For the figure of Hyperbole, is not a lye, more then any other figure of Rhetorike, in the true vnderstanding thereof, whereas after wrong vnderstanding, euen that which is spoken without all figure, is false, and vntrue. Finally, whereas he chargeth vs to denye the workes of the auncient writers, Dionysius, Ignatius, Polycarpus, Abdias &amp;c. that is a lowde lye, shadowed neither with Rhetorike nor reason: for we denye not the workes of those fathers, but we refuse counterfeit workes falsely ascribed to them, which thing if we proue not by manifest demonstration, we require no credit. As for that which he cauilleth against master Nowel, I omitte, as being confuted by master Nowel him selfe. But where

he sayeth, the scriptures woulde neuer abide him, that should saye: This is not my body: I answere, we neuer say: This is not Christes body, after any manner: but this is not his body after a grosse, carnall, or naturall maner, and that saying the scripture will abide, euen as well as this, The rocke was not Christ, naturally, substantially, or essentially, although the scripture saye, The rocke was Christ. Or this: Christ was not a vine, properly, naturally, or substantially, notwithstanding, that he sayeth: I am a verie or true vine. The prowde bragge which Sander maketh, that popish Catholikes lacke no scripture, for any of their assertions, how true it is, let all men iudge: seing that for many things they confesse they haue nothing to shewe, but tradition vnwritten. Likewise, how aptly in this controuersie of the supper, he hath examined the wordes of Christes supper, noted the circumstances of thinges done and saide there, conferred the scriptures of both the testaments, and ioyned the fathers of the first sixe hundred yeres. And yet he fauoureth him selfe so much in his doing, that hee boldly affirmeth vs to haue no helpe of those things. For scriptures we cannot conferre, to make the wordes of the supper plaine, because Doing, and the words therof, are more playne then any other place of scripture, concerning it, as ye passion of Christ is more playne, then the lawe and Prophets. &amp;c. If this were true, the Apostles labored in vayne, to proue the passion of Christ, out of the lawe and the Prophets, and the rest of the writings of the Apostles, are needlesse, and vncertayne instruction, if the historye of the passion, doth teach all the doctrine that is necessary to be knowen, concerning it. But it is a clarkly conclusion of Sander: That if the words of the supper be figuratiue, none other can be playne: as though figuratiue speaches, cannot be playne, when they are vsed for playnesse sake, of them that knowe how to vse them. And because Sander chargeth vs, Tell me masters &amp;c: I say likewise: Tell me masters, Are these wordes recorded, to be spoken in the institution &amp; action of the supper? This is the new Testament in my bloud. Tell me

I say, are these the verie words which Christ then spake, or the interpretation of them? If they be the very words, which of you wil say, they are not figaratiue? If they be ye interpretation, then are they more cleere &amp; plaine, then those words which he vttered: This is my bloude. Now whether the iudgement of the primitiue Church, for the first 600. yeares maketh for vs, as it hath in many treatises, so in this that followeth, it shalbe shewed sufficiently. Last of all, it wil appeare, both by the scriptures, and testimonie of the fathers, that the iudgemēt of the externall senses, or naturall reason, was not the first argument that might moue thē that first departed from antichristianitie, to the ancient &amp; true vnderstāding of the mysteries of Christ in his supper. Of ye almightie power of Christ we doubt no more, then of his will reueiled in scriptures, in which seeing we learne, yt Christ concerning his humanitie, was made like vs in all things, except sin: and that our bodies, after the resurrection, shal be made like to his glorious body, Heb. 2 ver 17 Phil. 3. 21 which seeing it cannot stand with transubstantiation, wee may not reasō of his power so, that we should ouerthrow his wil. For he is almightie to do whatsoeuer, he will, &amp; not willing to do whatsoeuer he can. But of ye whole matter, we shal intreate more at large, as occasiō is giuen, in the bookes following.
                  
               
               
                  CAP. II.
                  
                     Certaine notes about the vse, and translation of holy scripture, Sander. to be remembred of him, that shall read this booke.
                  
                  Sander, prosessing that he followeth most, the vulgar Fulke. Latine translation, and lest the English Bible, because it almost neuer translateth any text well, whereof any cō
                     trouersie is in these our dayes, taketh in hand to proue, many falsifications and wrong translations, in the onely matter of the sacrament of Christes bodye and bloud. The first is Iohn the 6. ver. 27. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Operamini cibum permanentem, The true English were: worke the meate which carieth. The English bible turneth: Operamini,

labor for. We labor (saith he) for that which we seeke, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         not; we worke that stuffe, which is present with vs. This corruption the Sacramentaries haue vsed, because they doe not beleeue the meate which taryeth to be made really present, so that we may worke it by faith and bodie. This finall cause is falsely alledged, for we beleeue the meate that tarieth vnto eternall life, to be made really present by faith, to them that receiue the sacrament worthily. Contrariewise, the papistes holde, that the same meate is receiued, where it taryeth not vnto etetnall life, namely in the wicked. And concerning the corruption pretended, it is false: which Sander saith, that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      signifieth alwayes to worke, that which is present, and not to labour or seeke for that which is absent: for saint Paul writeth, 2. Thessa. 3. ver. 10. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Si quis non vult operar
                           •
                        : If any man will not labour, neither let him eate. Euery man cannot worke that stuffe which is present, as in Sanders example of a Carpenter, working a peece of tymber, therefore, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      signifieth to labour generally, either in seeking that which is absent, or in working that which is present. Wherefore this is a doltish distinction of doctor Sander, and a manifest corruption of the text, by leauing out such words as shewe the vanitie of this cauill, and ouerthrowe the difference of this distinction: For the wordes of Christ are these, speaking to the Iewes which sought him being absent, not because they sawe his miracles, but because they had beene filled with his breade. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : Labor ye, not for the meate which perisheth, but for the meate which abideth vnto eternall life. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , is but once set downe, which must be referred as wel to the meat which perisheth, as to the meate which taryeth; but being applyed to the meate which perisheth, it cannot be turned, Worke not the meare which perisheth, as stuffe that is present, but Labor not or seeke not for it (as you doe) which is absent, therefore it must be so turned, as it may serue for both. And where as Sander saith, that this meat is not laboured for, because it is not sought out by

our diligence, but giuen by Christ: it is a fonder reason, except you wil say that we must not labor for any good thinges, because all good thinges are the giftes of God. Finally, that you may see what a singular quarrelling, &amp; vaine glorious person he is, to seeke a knot in a rush, you shal vnderstande yt the papistes themselues translate this place euen as ye great bible doeth: namely Heskins, as well learned a Papist as Sander: lib. 2. Cap. 2. of his popishe Parliament.
                  The second text which he pretendeth to be falsified, is ver. 57. of the same chapter: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Qui manducat me, &amp; ipse viuet propter me. The true English is, He that eateth me, he shal also liue for me. The english bible readeth, he that eateth me, shall liue by the meanes of me. The best colour of his cauil, is that propter patrem, is translated in the same ver. For the father. Howbeit, seing 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      or propter, signifieth the efficient cause, there is no fraude in turning it, By the meanes of me, which is the same that is meant by, For me: and as I thinke was so turned by the translators, to shewe that, For the father, includeth not the finall cause, as it might seeme, but the eternall efficient cause of life. As for the cauillation, that a man may liue by meanes of him, which is absent, is altogether childish and ridiculous: for who can vnderstande him to be absent, which is eaten? The controuersie is not of the presence: but of the maner of the presence. But howe can the Papists digest this saying of Christ? He that eateth me, shall liue by me, or for me, when they affirme that wicked men eate him, which liue not by him, for this is generally true of all that eate him, and not to be restrayned to them that eate him worthily. For the Sacrament in deede, may be eaten vnworthily, but Christ himselfe, is not eaten, but where he giueth life.
                  The 3. corruption obserued by Sander, is vers. 58. of Iohn. 6. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : Qui manducat hunc panem, viuet in aeternum: The true English were, He that eateth this bread, shall liue for euer. The Bible doth english it, He that eateth of this bread. The adding of this word, Of▪ may be the Printers fault: for many translations reade

without Of. But seeing Sander confesseth it is a true saying, he that eateth of this breade, vsed by Christ before, verse 51. heere can bee no corruption, or falsification prooued. As for the distinction, which Sander maketh, betweene, eating Christ, and eating of Christ, eating his flesh, and eating of his flesh, is friuolus and vaine: for none eate of him, but they which eate him. Yes (saith he,) Of him we may eate, without the Sacrament, but him selfe wee properly eate, onely vnder the forme of breade. Howe vntrue this is, you may see by this argument: None can haue eternall life, except they eate Christ and the fleshe of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloode: But manie haue eternall life, which eate not the Sacrament: Therefore manie eate Christ, and the fleshe of Christ, which eate not the Sacrament. Ioan. 6. ver. 53. &amp; 57.
                  The 4. falsification is, in S. Matth. 26. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Cùm accepisset Iesus panem, &amp; gratias egisset, fregit, &amp; dedit discipulis, &amp; ait. The true English is, Iesus hauing taken breade, and giuen thankes (or blessed) brake and gaue to the disciples, and saide. The common Bible readeth: Iesus tooke breade, and when he had giuen thankes, hee brake it, and gaue i
                           •
                         to the disciples. The holy scripture saieth not, that Iesus brake it, neither that hee gaue it, but that hee brake and gaue. Againe in saint Marke saint Luke, and saint Paul, fiue times putting the particle (it) which is neither in the Greeke, nor in the Latine Bible. Who woulde thinke, that an auncient man would play the boye so kindly? What say you Sander, is not the particle (it) added, neither in Greeke nor Latine? When the accusatiue case is once set downe, and then followe transitiue verbes, is it the phrase of the Greeke or Latine tongue, to adde the particle it? You say he brake and gaue, but not brake it, nor gaue it. Will you teach vs a newe Grammer, that fregit and dedit be verbes newters absolute? Or if you wil say they bee verbes actiue transitiues, lest the wilde Irish boyes, that goe to the Grammer schoole, should hisse at you, as you goe about your popish and trayterous commission,

I would wish some young Redshanke ladde to oppose you, and aske you, what hee brake, and what hee gaue? If hee brake not and gaue not it, which hee tooke. If you say, hee brake his bodie, and not the breade, because you say, he so gaue his bodie, that hee gaue no breade, aduise your selfe, howe you will aunswere the breaking of Christes body, which was but once broken for vs on the crosse, but yet not broken into seuerall peeces, as that thing, whatsoeuer you will call it, was broken which hee gaue to his disciples. And this vndoubtedly you meane, when you say, The wordes of saint Matthew, doe not all stande in order, in so much as Christ said: the wordes of consecration, before hee brake the sacrament, or gaue to his disciples. And doe you nowe complaine of Saint Matthewe for disordering ye words? Verily saint Marke, saint Luke, and saint Paul, place the wordes in such sort as saint Matthew doeth. And if all these Euangelists, and Apostles, doe set the words out of order, whence come you, that will take vpon you to set thē in order? Haue you other places of scripture to proue this pretended inuersion of order? And if you had, haue you forgotten, what you did write euen nowe in the preface; that if there bee any obscuritie founde in the wordes of the supper, there is no other part of scripture that can cleere them? But standing of the wordes out of order, and that in euerie one that rehearseth them, must needes make vncerteintie and obscuritie, yea this standing, or not standing out of order, may decide a great parte of the controuersie: for if the wordes were spoken after he brake and gaue, then he brake and gaue breade. And seeing the placing of the wordes in all the Euangelistes, and saint Paul fauour this opinion, you shall not easily prooue the contrary against so manie faithfull and prudent witnesses, which had a care to place the wordes in such order, as they shoulde giue no manifest occasion of heresie by disordering them.
                  The fift corruption is in saint Luke 22. and Saint Paul, 1. Corinth. 11, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Hoc facite, the truest English

were, make this thing. The fullest, doe and make this thing. The common Bible readeth, in Saint Luke, this doe. In saint Paul, This doe yee. And that which is most abhominable of all, in the homily of the sacrament, it is translated, doe ye thus. This great abhomination, if in any booke it bee so founde, is but the Printers faulte, although in sense there bee no great difference. But seeing 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and facere signifieth to doe, as well as to make, what corruption or falsification can there be when it is translated To do? As for Sanders fullest translation, by doing, and making, is most absurde. For when a word hath two significations, no wise translator will render them both, but onely that, which is most proper for the place, and doing is here more proper then making. For though it sounde not absurdly, in Sanders blasphemous eares, when hee saieth: doe this, is all one as if he had said, make this my body: yet yt the body of Christ should be properly said to be made, by mē, which was once made in ye wombe of the virgin, by ye holy ghost, in all godly mens minds, it is both absurde and blasphemous. And that the word facite, is to be translated by doing, and not by making, it is euident by this, that S. Paule referreth it to the whole action of the supper, 1. Cor. 11. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      &amp;c. This doe, as often as you shall drinke it, in my remembrance: &amp;c So doth S. Cypryan manifestly lib.

If then it be commanded by ye Lord, &amp; the same thing is confirmed and deliuered by his Apostle, that so often as we drinke, we should doe this thing in remembrance of our Lord, which our Lord himself did, we are found that we do not obserue that which is commanded, except we also doe the same thinges which our Lord did. And ministring the cuppe after the same manner, we depart not from his diuine teaching. Last of all Heskins the papist, and other likewise before this Momus

translate it as we do. Hesk. lib. 2. ca. 42 Where he cauileth that our translation omitteth the word Thing, it is without all shadowe of reason, for by This, what can be vnderstood, but, this thinge? And seing our English Pronown This, doth aptly answere the Greeke pronowne 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , what neede is it to adde the worde, Thing, which is not expressed either in the Greeke or in the Latine?
                  The sixt falsification is affirmed to be in S. Luke, and Saint Paul Luke, 22. 1. Corinth. 11. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , In meam commemorationem. The true English were, For the remembrance of me, or To the end I may be remembred. The common bible turneth, in the remembrance of me. A strange quarell, if a man could vnderstande it. A thing (sayth he) may be donne best in the remembrance of a man, when the man is first remembred, and afterward the thing is done in the remembrance of him. And may not a man be firste remembred and afterward a thing don for the remembrance of him? Or would Sander, that Christ should not be thought vpon, before he see the Masse cake lifted vp, which he saith is made for the remembrance of him? For thus he fantasieth that Christ should say: When my body is made by the preist, and lifted vp to be adored, and all the people taught to bow downe to the body of Christ, and to come with pure conscience to receiue it, then Christ is remembred, by reason of his body made: and so the scripture is fulfilled which sayth, do and make this thing for the remembrance of me. If this be the fulfilling of the scripture, then was it not fulfilled for more then a thousand yeares after Christ, vntill eleuation and adoration of the sacrament were decreed. And then is it not fulfilled in any priuate Masse, where none of the people receiue, nor yet be taught to receiue it. Where he saith, that Christ can not be remembred by eating of bread &amp; drinking of wine, as the Sacramentaries would haue it, so effectually, and with such contrition, confession, and satisfaction, as he requireth, but by folowing of his crosse and death, by penance, by humilitie, by confessing our finnes to his ministers, and taking absolution of them: I answere, the Protestants require not only eating and

drinking, but preaching of the Lords death, repentance, fayth, loue, and reuerence in the receiuers: as for the rest of popish trumpery, when he can shewe that Christ required, or the Apostels vsed, we will gladly admit it. In the meane time let the readers iudge, how this later kind of remembrance, can be learned out of the former, which I haue set downe in his owne wordes, of making, lyfting, adoring, &amp;c.
                  Beside these great corruptions, there are other two small faults, in S. Paul. The first, 1. Cor. 10. that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is turned, the partaking, where it should be, the communicating of the body &amp; bloud of Christ. This he counteth a lesser fault, because the Catholike Latine translation, in one place calleth it participatio, a partaking: which is (saith he) when parte of a thing is taken, and not the whole. I thinke the translatour vsed the word of partaking, because it is better knowen to English mē, then the terme of communicating: Especially, seing the Apostle vseth both termes indifferently, as one. For in the next verse, he saith, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : The vulgar Latine is, Omnes qui de vno pane participamus: All wee which do partake of one breade: And speaking of them which did eate the Sacrifices of Israelites, of which, euery one did not eate the whole, he saide they were 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , communicators of the altar. And them that take part of the sacrifice of the Gentiles, he calleth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , communicators with diuels. And returning to the Christians, he sayeth: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . You cannot partake of the table of the Lorde, and of the table of diuels. Wherefore in that translation, there is neither falsification, nor corruption, great or small. The last fault is, 1. Cor. 10. in the place by mee cited: wee all partake 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which should de Englished of the one bread. For such strength hath the Greeke article 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , &amp; sometime the cō
                        mon bible turneth the Greeke article into That. What say you, Sander, hath the Greeke article such strength alwayes? If you say so, you wil be thought to be a simple Grecian.

If only sometimes, you must shewe better reason then you do, why it hath such strength heere, or els the Englishe translation is good inough. For by the outwarde signe which is the partaking of one bread, the Apostle proueth the spirituall coniunction of all the faithfull in one body, and vseth not the name of bread siguratiuely, for that which Christ calleth the bread of life, &amp;c. And vnto this translation, agreeth S. Ambrose in 1. Cor. 11. saying: The gift that is offered perteyneth to al the people, 
                        quia in vno pane omnes significantur: per id quod enim vnum simus de vno pane nos omnes sumere oportet: because in one bread they are all signified: for in that we are one, we ought to receiue all of one bread. Of the same iudgment is Hierom vpon the very place, saying: 
                        Omnes quidem de vno pane, &amp; de vno calice participamus. We all partake of one bread &amp; of one cup.
                      The like is Chrysost. &amp; all the old writers in a maner. You see what shamelesse cauilling, &amp; racking he vseth, to make a shewe of corruption in the English Bible, against which his malice is so great, that he chargeth not the translators, but the English Bible to haue turned, to haue falsified, to haue corrupted, as though that if there were any iust fault to be founde in ye translation, the English Bible should beare the blame for it, and be despised of all English men. God be thanked, that although it may not be denyed, but some faultes haue and may escape the best translations, yet the translators haue a cleere conscience from falsifying, and corrupting, and the faultes are not so great, that any pernitious errour may be grounded on them, nor so many by a thousand partes as are in that Latine translation, which the Papistes admit, as onely Catholike &amp; authenticall.

                        ulke. vpon euery matter, which if they be false, it shall be as easy for me to deny, as for him to affirme them, referring the tryall of euery cause as he doth, vnto the treatise folowing. First it is false, which he affirmeth, that from the beginning of the Christian Church, vnto the yere of our Lord 1517. All the Church both Greeke and Latine openly professed the carnall presence of Christes body and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine. For the Greek church neuer receiued transubstantiation, nor yet taught so grossely of the real presence, as the Papists: nor held the same opinion of consecration which the papists doe. For after the wordes of Christ vttered in their liturgye, they pray thus vnto God: 
                        Fac panem quidem hunc, honorabile corpus Christi tui, quod autem in calice est, honorabilem sang
                              〈…〉
                            Christi tui, ea sancto tuo spiritu transmutante. And make this breade, the honorable body of thy Christe, and that which is in the cuppe, the honorable bloud of thy Christe, thy holy spirite changing them. This was obiected vnto them in the late Councell of Florence. It is also false, that he sayeth, no man in open pulpet, with the auctority or toleration of any spirituall pastor, did preach the contrary: for Wickleef whom he nameth a corner whisperer, in open pulpet preached the same, as his homilies remayning in writing, are a playne testimonye, as in 
                        Hom. 5. Sept. quad. in. 6. Ioan. Here it is needfull for men to wite, that there ben two manner of meates, ghostly and bodily: but bodily is well knowne. But nede were here to knowe how men should ghostlye eate Christ. For no man that hath witte dreadeth, that Christ speaketh not here of bodily eating and drinking of his flesh and his blode. For els no man should be saued: for no man is an etene, to seede him thus bodily of Christ, and therefore it were to witte, how men should ghostly feede them thus. For Christ telleth in his words, how men should eate him ghostly, and to this, wite saith Christ here, that the wordes that he speaketh to them, be spirite and life, for such is witte of his wordes. These

wordes in their owne kinde ben such as were his other wordes, but wite of these wordes there is spiritual and mannes life. Also Christ saieth there soothly, that each man that shall be saued, shal bee fed of Christ thus. But this may not be vnderstonden of fleshly food of Christs body: And so it mote be vnderstonden algatys of gostly foode, for of bodily foode of Christ may not two be fed together, and so Christ speaketh of ghostly food, by which many bee fed farre and neere.

And although the efficacy of error. preuayled by Gods iust iudgment ouer a great part of the world, yet had Christ alwayes his two witnesses, to protest against it, as Berengarius, Scotus, Waldo, Hen

                     The meane that maketh present that blessed body (sayeth Sander) is transubstantiation, which being made present thereby, who can deny, but that it is a sacrifice aboue all other external kindes of worshipping, syth at the time of the consecration, it is giuen for vs vnbloodily, as the wordes of Christ sound, Luke 22. which is geuen for you. But seing S. Paule in exposition of the same wordes, sayth: which is broken for you, who is either so ignorant, or so blasphemous to deny, that the giuing in S. Luke, is to be referred vnto his death and bloudy sacrifice, which was his only sacrifice of himself offered once for all. Agayne, when al ye three Euangelists, speaking of the sacrament of his bloud, saye, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,

which is shed for many and for you, sith at the time of the consecration it is shed for vs, as well as his body is giuen for vs; who is so shameles, to saye, that it is giuen for vs vnbloudily inye sacrament? Or if the word of shedding being of ye pre

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      which is, giuen▪ to a present giuing or sacrifising?
                  But proceeding in his vaine purpose, he sheweth, that the faultes of the popish clergy aduanced by transubstantiation, caused them to bee contemned of the people, which contempt by Gods iustice stirred vp Martin Luther, like a proude king of Babylon, to come out of the North, to fight against Ierusalē. Can you forbeare laugh ing? They that were carnal in the Popish Church, priests bishops to holde their liuings, Abats and Monkes for good pensions receiued this doctrine and gaue vp their abbies to the Prince. But this good hath Luther done, that he separated the good from the badde, especially from the Popish votary, the maried Monke and vowed Preist, which sayeth, No man ought to vowe chastity, condemning therby, not only an infinit number of virgins, but also the blessed mother of God. To this I answer, that first of all he slaundereth them, which denye the vow of chastity, or rather celebrate (for euery man is bound to liue chastly) to be lawfull, for they denye it, to be lawfull only to those which are not certeine, that they haue the gift of continency to continue with them long as they liue. And as for ye vow of the virgin Mary, I pray you how proueth he that she made any? Because (saith he) she wondered how she might haue a child, seing she knew not any man. Wherunto her own reason might haue replyed that hereafter shee might knowe a man, except shee had vowed her selfe not to knowe at all any man. I answere, that though her reason might haue so replied, for hauing a child, yet for hauing such a child, as should be the sonne of ye highest, reason could not satisfie her, and therfore shee desired to be instructed by the angel, by what meanes it should be, without that any vow of virginity, can be concluded

in any lawfull forme of argument, out of this place, by any Logician in the world. But contrariwise, that she was betrothed vnto a man, it is an vndoubted argument, that she vowed not virginitie. For if she should haue made any vow before her mariage, she would not haue deluded her husband, to promise her body to him, when she had determined the contrarie. If they say, she vowed after mariage: it is plaine by the Gospel, she did it without her husbandes knowledge, and therefore her vowe could not be lawfull. For before Ioseph was instructed by the Angel of her case, his purpose was to haue taken her home to him, and vsed her as his wife, vntill she was perceiued to be with child, and then he would haue priuily forsaken her.
                  After this he sheweth what were ye opinions of Luther, Zwinglius and Caluine, which he maketh to be three, in number, when by the consent of ye Churches of Heluetia &amp; Sabandia it is manifest, that the iudgement of Zwinglius and Caluine, concerninge the manner of eating and drinking of Christes bodye and bloud in the sacrament of his supper, was all one. Now concerning that Caluine willeth vs to goe into heauen by faith, there to feede of Christ spiritually: Sander liketh it not, because our nature not beeing able to climme vp to the seate of God in heauen, the sonne of God came downe to vs, to life vs vp into heauen, in taking vpon him our humaine nature. So when our faith called for Christ to come from heauen to helpe vs, he let downe the corde of his humanitie, and of his flesh and bloud. And shall wee nowe, when it is let downe to be fastened in our bodies, and in the bottome of our heartes, by eating it really, shall wee nowe refuse it, and say, wee will goe into heauen by faith our selues, and there take holde of Christ, whereby we may be deliuered out of the deepe vale of miserie? As though the corde shoulde haue needed to haue beene let downe, if wee coulde haue fastened our bodyes to anything in heauen, and ye
                           •
                         our bodies are they which weigh downe our soules chiefely. In deede, if the sonne of God, had not come downe vnto vs, and ioyned our nature vnto his, the anchor of our

faith, could haue had no hould in heauen. But seing the sonne of God did not only come downe vnto vs, but also is ascended from the earth, and hath caried vs vp into heauen with him, Eph. 2. ver. 6. he letteth no more downe vnto vs the corde of his humanitye, but we cast vp the sure anchor of our soules, which is fayth, entring into the inward parte of yt spirituall tabernacle, which is heauen, whither our forerunner Iesus is entred, being an high preist for euer after the order of Melchizedek. Heb. 6. ver. 19. And vnto this ascension by fayth, the Apostle exhorteth vs Coll. 3. 1. If you be risen againe with Christ, seeke those things that are aboue, where Christ is sitting at the right hande of God, set your minde vpon things that are aboue, &amp; not vpō things that are vpon the earth. These authorities proue sufficiently, that we must goe into heauen by fayth our selues, for the sonne of God after his dispensation fully accomplished in this world, cōmeth no more downe to vs in his humaine nature, vntil he come againe to receiue vs actually into the participation of his glory, according to his promise. Iohn. 14. 3. But now let vs see, what wholesome doctrine Sander teacheth in those his wordes euen nowe set downe. First, that fayth perteineth onely to the fathers before Christ, and in them called for Christ to come downe vnto vs, which when he is come, &amp; dayly letteth down the cord of his humanity, we haue no neede of faith to fasten it in our bodyes and hartes, but of our hands. For fayth he compareth to the tongue, by meanes whereof, helpe is called for, but when a corde is lett downe, the vse of the tonge is needeles, and the handes must be occupied. Therfore he saith: It is not sufficient for a man to vse his tongue still, and to let his handes alone. So that by this kind of reasoning, eating it really, being let downe, is the hand, that without the tongue of faith fasteneth it to our bodies &amp; hearts. Thirdly he holdeth, that Christ neded not to haue ben incarnat, if men could haue fastened their bodies to any thing in heauen. Whereby he denieth, that the fathers of the olde Testament by fayth, were fastened in heauen, before the incarnatiō of Christ,

restreining the vertue thereof, not onely vnto the time, since the same was actually perfourmed, but also to the actuall and carnall manner of coniunction of the body of Christ with our bodies, which they imagine to be in eating the flesh of Christ really.
                  To conclude, professing that hee intendeth not to speake against the persons, but against the opinions of the Sacramentaries, specially against Zwinglius &amp; Caluine, his purpose is, to proue out of the worde of God: That Christ giueth in his last supper, the true substance of his flesh and bloud, not onely to our soules, by wordes of promise, but also to our bodyes vnder the formes of bread and wine. Note here, that the giuing, wherein is the controuersie, perteineth to our bodies, and not to our soules. Also that the giuing of Christes fleshe and bloud to our soules, if I vnderstand this saying, is not really, but by wordes of promise: whereof it ensueth that they, which haue not eaten the flesh and bloud of Christ with their bodies, from the beginning of the worlde, are all perished, because none can haue life in them, but they that haue eaten his flesh and bloud, which Sander holdeth cannot be eaten, really and in deede, but vnder the formes of bread and wine in the sacrament.

                  He promiseth to shewe, first, out of the worde of god, Fulke. and next out of the monuments of the auncient fathers, what the beliefe of the Papistes is, concerning this sacrament. Although he esteemeth euen Albertus, Thomas, Bonauenture, Alexander, &amp;c. worthie of credit, by a rule of S. Aug. cont.

rose betweene the Papistes &amp; vs. Wherfore in this rule of Augustine is to be considered, not betweene what persons, but what time the question first arose betweene any persons, and so the fathers of the first 600. yeares are the best and lest partiall witnesses.
                  Furthermore, he sheweth that the supper of the Corinthians, was not the supper of Christ, but he had a supper of his owne. And so rehearsing the wordes of the institution, out of the Eua
                        〈…〉
                     listes &amp; S. Paul: hee affirmeth
                        •
                      that we are informed by these words, the supper of Christ to be his owne body &amp; bloud, giuen vnder the signes of ye bread &amp; wine, whereupon he gaue thankes, turning by his almightie power the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of his body &amp; bloud. That Christ giueth his body to them that receiue the bread and wine worthily, it shalbe no controuersie betweene vs. But that he giueth it vnder ye signes of bread and wine, vnderstanding (as he doeth) signes for accidents, he should haue prooued out of Gods worde, if either he would or could haue kept promise, likewise, that Christ gaue thankes vpon the bread and wine, and thirdly, that he turned the substance therof into ye substāce of his body &amp; bloud. But leauing other arguments for other places, &amp; not being able to proue these things in any place, he wil enquire, whether the name &amp; nature of a supper be more agreable to their beliefe, or to our meaning? that is (saith he) whether Christ made his last supper of the substance of cōmon bread &amp; wine, or of his owne reall body and bloud. As though we affirmed, that the only substance of Christes supper were common bread &amp; wine, &amp; not the body &amp; bloud of Christ. But to proceed, &amp; let him goe with that lye, his first argument to prooue how deintie &amp; costly a banket Christ made, taking his leaue of his friends, is taken of the great preparatiō &amp; promise made of it so long before, which promise &amp; preparatiō, how euil fauouredly he prooueth out of Melchizedeks bread &amp; wine, Manna, the table of Dauid &amp; Salomon, ye bread &amp; flesh of Elias, &amp;c, I omitt. His conclusion is, we must not suppose, that Christ at his farewell, gaue any other deinties, beside common bread &amp; wine sanctified in vse onely, and

not consecrated in substance. You may see, howe absurdly he speaketh, common bread sanctified, which is as good as if he would say, Christ gaue white blacke bread, or whot colde wine. We affirme that ye bread &amp; wine were consecrated, not in accidents, but in substance, to the vse of an holy sacrament, yt they might be the body &amp; bloud of Christ, to as many as receiued the same worthily, not by conuersion of the natural substance of one thing into another, but by a wonderfull diuine &amp; vnspeakable change of that which is ordinatily a weake element, of ye world, to be a mightie foode, vnto eternall life. The second argument he vseth to proue the excellencie of the banket, is of the fine cookerie (I vse his owne terme, which also he doth exemplifie by making 16. or 20. dishes of egges alone, which cannot be without many spices &amp; mixture, &amp; great labour, &amp;c.) But Christ, like a most cunning workman, of simple &amp; litle stuffe, and that without help of his disciples, to prepare it, made the gretest &amp; finest feast that euer was heard of, vsing no shifts, but only blessing or thanksgiuing. The sinesse of this cookerie he setteth forth, by a fine speculation of ye furniture of the world, by the Angels, heauens &amp; elements, frō whence it pleased God to make a reuolt of al things, from the bottome of the earth, vpward againe towardes him self: And so made out of ye earth vegitatiue thinges, then sensible creatures, &amp; last man, wt a reasonable soule, as a briefe summe of all creatures, &amp; a litle worlde, who being seduced by the diuel, was by the incarnation of ye sonne of God, restored, &amp; then al thinges were briefely brought againe to God. So that in this banket, where Christ is giuen, there is serued in one dish a composition most delicate, of angels, heauens, elements, of herbes fishes, birds, beasts, of reasonable men, and of God himselfe. No kind of salet meates, sauce, fruits, consectiō, no kind of wine, aqua vitae, aqua composita, liquors, syrops, can be found in nature, made by art, d

that the breade and wine, being turned into the body and bloud of Christ, are also turned into Angels, heauens, elements, herbes, fishes, birdes, beastes, men, &amp; God him selfe? yea, into all salets, meates, sauces, fruits, confections, all kindes of wine, aqua vitae, aqua composita, all liquors and syrops, beside porredge, puddings, pyes, pancakes, and a great many other thinges, which you haue not named, but comprehended in generall wordes? Is there a reall conuersion in deede, by reason of your heraphicall reuolution? And is this doctrine agreable to the word of God? In what place is it written, I pray you? I suppose it to be this: Eph. 1. It hath pleased God to restore in Christ all things which are in heauen, &amp; which are in earth in him. Where the Greeke word 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , importeth a briefe gathering into one certeine head and summe, that all thinges in heauen and earth, are brought vnto Christ, and in him as it were againe, begonne and renewed. And cannot this be done, except the body of Christ do really conteine all things by your surmised reuolt? for I dare not vnderstand you siguratiuely, seeing you abhorre figures in this matter of the supper; nor Hyberbolically, for that you count no better then a rhetoricall lye. Wherefore, if these things be really conteined, as you say, I thinke it small for the worship of Christes banket, whose excellencie I take to be so great, that it conteineth not these grosse meates of the body, but an heauenly refreshing of the soule. And that will the olde fathers, whome you cite for your cookery, plainly testifie with me. First Cyprian de Coen. Dom. Vident haec sacramenta, &amp;c. The poore in spirite see these sacraments, and contenting themselues with this one dish, they despise all the delicats of this world, and possessing Christ, they disdaine to possesse any stuffe of this worlde. Beholde Cyprian sayeth nor, that this dish conteineth al foules, fishes, sauces, spices, &amp;c. but that al these are despised of them yt are partakers of this dish. Againe, speaking of the wicked, Et a secretis diuinis omnium intra se continentibus summam, diffugiunt &amp; recedunt, &amp;c. They fly and depart from the diuine secrets, which conteine within them selues the briefe or summe of all mysteries.
                  
                  
                     
He saith not, they containe meates and drinkes, syropes and confections, but ye summe of al mysteries or heauenly, &amp; diuine treasures, But (saith Sander) when saint Cyprian saith, intra se, within them, he meaneth within the compasse, or formes of breade and wine, for these onely are the thinges that we can poynt vnto, within or without: Belike he will teach vs newe Grammar, and newe Latine also. For in our old Latine and Grammar, we learned, that sui and suus were reciproca, but Sander will teach vs that, se, signifieth the compasse or formes of breade and wine: Or if the worde se, signifie themselues, as it was wont to doe, Sander wil teach vs, that the compasse or formes of bread and wine, are the diuine secrets themselues. For Cyprian saith yt the diuine secrets within themselues containe ye summe of al mysteries. But marke his reason, and you wil thinke that an Oxe hath lowed it out, rather then a man spoken it. The compasse or formes of bread, are ye onely things yt we can poynt vnto within, or without: for other meat &amp; drinke, we see not, quoth he. He will haue nothing but yt he can point vnto with his hand, and see with his bodily eye. Whereas diuine secretes, whereof Cyprian speaketh, can neither be seene with the eye, nor poynted at with ye finger, but onely be vnderstoode by faith, in them to whom God hath reueiled them.
                  His next witnesse is Chrysostome: in 1. Cor. Hom. 24 Quando corpus Christi, &amp;c. When the body of Christ is set before thee, say with thy selfe: For this bodies sake, I am no more earth and ashes. For this I hope to receiue heauen, and the good thinges which are in heauen, immortall life, the seate of Angels, the companie of Christ. The very table is the strength of our soule, the bonde of trust, the foundation, our hope, saluation, life. If wee goe hence pure with this sacrifice, with most great confidence, we shall ascende to the holy porch or entrie, as it were compassed rounde about with golden garments. But what rehearse I thinges to come? whiles we are in this life, this mysterie causeth, that the earth is heauen to vs. Whatsoeuer Chrysostome saith here, we acknowledge to be true as he did meane it: but nothing he saith for Master Sanders reuolution, and as little for the carnall manner of presence or eating of

Christes body. For euen as we are no more earth and asshes, &amp; as earth is made heauen, which is after a spiritual manner by fayth, and yet truly and vndoubtedlye, so is the body of Christ present &amp; eaten, at ye table. According to which meaning he saith in the same homily, 
                        Quemadmodū enim corpus illud vnitū est Christo, ita &amp; nos per hunc panem vnione coniungimur. For euen as that body is vaited to Christ, so we also by this bread are joyned in an vnion. Note heere, yt body &amp; this bread to be diuerse thinges in naturall substance: &amp; againe our coniunction to be by the bread mystically: for naturally and substantially wee are not ioyned one to another, but in an heauenly kinde of vnion, we are made one bodye of Christ, and members one of another. And this is not an emptye dish of faith, as Sander calleth it, but a full mysterie of saluation. And although faith shall cease when we haue the full fruition of Gods promises in heauen, yet doth Sander both absurdly, and vnfaithfully gather therof, an opposition of faith and trueth, wheras faith hath thereof the name in Hebrue, because it is grounded vpon truth. But what meaneth he by truth, that which he preferreth aboue the receiuing by faith? Namely the carnall manner of receiuing Christes body, which hee holdeth the wicked may doe to their damnation. A worthy truth, in respect of which, saith is counted litle worth as an empty dish, which yet by their owne doctrine, must make their trueth effectuall to saluation. But see I pray you, howe cunningly he reasoneth of the finall cause. Christ tooke flesh (saith he) that our bodies might haue a banket made to them, as the soules of the faithfull neuer lacked God, whom they might feede on by faith and spirit. By which reason the godly of the old testament, before Christes incarnation, were but halfe nourished, namely in soules onely, and not in bodyes, if Christes flesh bee not a meat otherwise then receiued into the body, after the Popishe meaning. Yet he supposeth, that Cyrillus fauoureth this argument, In Ioan. lib. 4. Cap. 14. Oporiui

Therefore he saith, immediatly after in the same place:

Neither let the Iewe of the dulnes of his minde, thinke, that we haue inuented such mysteries as were neuer heard of: for hee shall see, if he will search more attentiuely, that the same thing hath beene alwaies done by figure, since the time of Moses. For what hath deliuered their auncestors from the plague of the Aegyptians, when death raged against ye first borne of the Aegyptians? Is it not manifest, that they being taught by the institution of God,

did eate the flesh of a Lambe and annoynted the postes and vpper dore postes, with bloude, and therefore death departed from them? For destruction, that is the death of this flesh, did rage against mankinde for the transgression of ye first man. For because of sinne we heard, Earth thou art, and into earth thou shalt returne. But because Christ by his flesh, was to ouerthrow this cruel tyrant, therefore that mysterie was shadowed to the old fathers, and being sanctified with the flesh and bloud of ye sheepe (God so willing) they escaped destruction. Why therfore ô Iewe, art thou troubled, seeing the trueth alreadie prefigured? Wherfore, I say, art thou troubled, if Christ say, Except ye eat the flesh of the sonne of Man, &amp; drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in your selues, whereas it behoued thee being instructed in the Lawe of Moses, &amp; taught to beleeuing by the old shadows, to be most readie to vnderstande these mysteries? This place of Cyrill, sheweth at large, that he meaneth not by tast and touching, or meate which is of alliance with vs, the naturall bodie of Christ, but the outward part of the sacrament: namely, the bread and wine: for of the bodie of Christ, there is neither taste, nor touching bodily in the sacrament. But euen as by eating of the Lambes flesh, and anoynting of the bloude, which prefigured the flesh and bloude of Christ, and was a meate of kindred or alliance with them, with whose taste and touching they were acquainted, the Iewes were assured of their deliuerance: so we by eating, and drinking these outwarde signes of Christes bodie and bloude, are assured of eternall life. For you must note, that he saith hoc ipsum the selfe same thing, was alwayes done by figure, from the time of Moses. What was that? namely, that not onely our soules by the holy Ghost, but also our bodies by externall sacramentes, were brought to immortalitie. But the same thing could not be done according to the Popish meaning before Christs incarnation: therefore Cyrill is nothing lesse then of the Popish meaning.
                  The last witnesse is Tertullian de resur. Carnis: The flesh is washed that the soule may be clensed. The flesh is oynted, that

the soule may be consecrated. The flesh is signed, that the soule may be defenced. The flesh is shadowed by imposition of hande, that the soule also may be illuminated. The flesh is fedde with the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, that the soule also may be made fat of God. They cannot therfore be parted in reward, whom worke ioynesh.
                  
                  We agree to that which Tertullian saith, yt our flesh is fed with yt body &amp; bloud of Christ, but not after a carnall or natural maner, by receiuing the body and bloud at our mouthes, &amp;c: but after a spiritual manner, as he himselfe sheweth in the same booke. 
                        Nam quia durum &amp; intollerabilem existimauerunt sermonem eius, quasi verè carnem suam illis edendam determinasse, vt in spiritum disponeret statum salutis, promisit spiritus est qui vi
                              •
                           ificat. For because they thought his saying hard, and intollerable, as though he had determined that his flesh was to be eatē of thē verily, that he might dispose the state of saluation into the spirit, he saide before: It is the spirit that quickeneth.
                  
                  In these words Tertullian counteth it, the error of the Capernaites, to thinke that Christ determined, that his flesh should be eaten verily, meaning that his fleshe was not to be eaten after a grosse and naturall manner, with the mouth and teeth, but with faith, and heart. Againe the argument of the resurrection of our bodies, which he draweth of eating the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, cannot stande but with a spirituall eating thereof. For what hope should all the fathers before the incarnation of Christ, and so many thousand Christians as since that time haue neuer receiued the sacrament, haue of the resurrection of their bodies, if the vertue thereof were included in the popish imagined manner of eating? Therfore Tertullian meaneth plainely, that the externall sacraments, which are receiued with the body, &amp; beare the name oftentimes of the thinges, whereof they are sacraments, are arguments and assurances, that saluation perteineth both to the bodie and to the soule, and not that the bodie eateth and drinketh really the substance of Christs body and bloud, vnder the formes of bread and wine, any more then the body receiueth the holy ghost vnder the forme of water, or imposition of hands &amp;c.

                     and wine, but to the soule he giueth himselfe by saith, spirit, and vnderstanding. This he maketh to be all the banket of the newe brethren. Against this he inueyeth in a long chapter. But either he is ignorant what we teach, or rather he is not willing to shewe it, that by rehersing it imperfectly, he might haue more aduantage to dispute against it. We beleeue, that Christ giuing vnto vs bread and wine, as visible seales of his inuisible grace, giueth to ye whole man, his body and blood, to be receiued of him by faith, after a spiritual and wonderful maner, passing al vnderstanding of man, wherby we are assured, that we are spiritually fed, vnto eternal life, euē as by the seale of baptisme, we are assured that we are spiritually, and wonderfully washed from our sins, &amp; born anew to be ye sonnes of God. We say not therefore ye god giueth himselfe by faith, spirit &amp; vnderstanding, to our soules onely: but he giueth himself vnto vs, to be receiued by faith &amp; spirituallie. But now let vs see what fault he findeth wt our saying: we say ye truth (saith he) but not all the trueth. For this had bene somewhat worth, before ye incarnation of Christ, whē Christ was eaten only by faith, but since his incarnation, he giueth vs an other kind of truth thē euer he gaue to thē So faith M. S. But S. Paul saith, our fathers did al eate ye same spiritual meate yt we do, and drink the same spiritual cuppe yt we do, for they dranke of ye rocke, which rocke was Christ, as substantially as ye bread and wine are his body &amp; bloud vnto vs. 1. Cor. 10. But S. saith our eating lacketh some truth, because ye whol mā is not fed. I answere yt is no cause, for we hold yt the whole man is fed wt Christ, to be saued both body &amp; soule. For wher he 
                        ••
                     ith, yt faith seedeth but ye soule, it is false: for God by faith feedeth both bodie and soule vnto eternal life. But this is Sanders error, yt he thinketh Christ cannot feede our bodies by faith, except he thrust his body in at our

mouthes. He might likewise say, that in baptisme we are but halfe regenerated in soule onely, because the holy ghost is not powred ouer our bodies: yet we beleue that we are washed &amp; regenerated wholy both in body and soule, so that our bodies by baptisme are engraffed into the death, burial, &amp; resurrection of Christ. Rom. 6 and so we beleeue, yt by eating of this bread, &amp; drinking of this cuppe of the Lord worthily, our whole man is fed after a spirituall manner, with the quickning flesh and bloude of our sauiour Christ, vnto euerlasting life. And wheras Leo saith, That is taken by the mouth, which is beleeued Ser. 6. de Iei

In which sense, the same Leo writeth Epistel. 10. ad Plaui, against the heresie of Eutyches.

Let him see what nature being striken through with nayles, hath hanged on the woode of ye crosse, and when ye side of him that was crucified was opened, let him vnderstand, from whence yt blood &amp; water flowed, yt the church of god might be moistened, both by a lauer, &amp; by a cupp. By these words he sheweth, that ye bloud in ye cuppe, is none otherwise ye bloud of Christ, thē ye water of baptisme, is ye water that issued out of his side, which is far from ye popish vnderstanding. As for ye often eating &amp; drinking, recorded in ye scriptures, in ye sacrifices, Manna, ye rocke, water, ye Paschal lambe ye shewbread, &amp; c: which Sāder wold haue to be but figures of ye bodily eating of Christs flesh: I answere they were sacraments of ye spiritual norishmēt of ye faithful appointed for that time, as this supper is appropriated to our time, and not because the bodily eating of the forbidden fruit, could not otherwise be purged, from vs, but by bodily eating of Christs flesh, as he assurmeth. The sinne of Adam was not in eating, but in eating disobediently, so that eating of it selfe, was no fault, nor any poyson was

in the nature of the fruite, that was eaten, as Sander dreameth, but disobedience was the sin of Adam, which by the obedience of Christ is done awaye as S. Paul teacheth, Rom. 5. ver. 19. As by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so by ye obedience of one man many shall be made righteous. Neither doth Cyprian saye otherwise, although he allude to the tasting of the forbidden fruite, De Coen. Dom. Bibimus &amp;c: We drinke of the bloud of Christ himselfe commanding, being partakers of eternall life with him, and by him, abhorring the sinnes of naturall lust as vnpure bloud, &amp; granting our selues by tast of sinne to haue ben depriued from blessednes and condemned, except the mercy of Christ, had brought vs againe vnto fellowship of eternal life by his bloud. Although Cyprian here allude vnto the acte in which disobedience was committed, yet in the end he sheweth, that by the obedience of Christe shedding his bloud for vs, we are restored into the fauor of God, and not by actuall drinking of the naturall bloud of Christ into our bodyes. Neither doth Prosper Aquitanicus thinke otherwise, Cont. Collat, Liberum ergo arbitrium &amp;c. Free will therfore, that is, the voluntary appetite of the thing that pleased it selfe, after it had lothed the vse of the good thinges which it had receiued, and the aydes of his owne happines, waxing of such account with it, bent his impotent greedines, vnto the experience of disobedience, dranke the poyson of all vices, and drouned the whole nature of man with the dronkennes of his intemperance Thence it commeth, that before the eating of the same flesh of the sonne of man and drinking his bloud, he digest that deadly surset, he fayleth in memory, erreth in iudgment, wauereth in going, neither is he by any meanes meet to chuse and desire that good thing, wherof he depryued himself of his owne accord. This eating and drinking cannot be vnderstood of eating and drinking the Sacrament, for the will of man must be prepared both to chuse and desire that good, from which man is fallen, before euer he be admitted to the Lordes table, as euery Papist will confesse. What impudencie then is it, vpon shadowe of some allusion, to drawe the ancient Doctors sayings so contrary to their meaning? But Sander seeing the shamefull absurditie

that followeth of this his imagined reall eatinge of Christes fleshe, to satisfie for the reall eating of Adams aple, for so he calleth it, saith it is no more needfull that euery mā should eate the body of Christ in his own person, then that euerye one should eate of the aple to make them guilty, but it is absolutely needful (saith he) that some 
                           •
                        r other eate it as really, as euer the apple was eaten, that all the rest, who by baptisme enter into the same body, may be one perfectly with Christ, whiles they are one mystically with thē, who really eate the substance of Christes flesh, being the substance of our true sacrifice, truly rosted vpon the crosse. This shift of descant, then will not serue the fathers of the old testament, which were not baptised verily as the Papistes holde, but in figure only. Secondly if any such real eating were necessary, it were not to be fulfilled by any, but by our sauiour Christ: for what soeuer the transgression of Adam was, who being but one, made al guilty of damnation, that was to be satisfied by the iustification of one man, which was Christ, sufficient for all men vnto iustification of life, Rom. 5. ver. 18. Last of all I praye you marke Sander his phrase of speech: The flesh of Christ was truly rosted vpon the crosse. To omitte the grosse figure of rosting., and to register it among the other pointes of fine cookery in the chapter before described: Marke that he saith, it was truly rosted vpon the crosse, and yet I dare say, he meaneth not that the crosse was a very spitt, nor yet burning with fire to scorche it. But when we affirme that Christ is truely eaten, he can by no meanes allowe our saying, except we should meane as he doth, that Christ is putt in at our mouthes, and if not chewed with our teeth, which some of them holde, yet swallowed downe our throte, and so receiued into our bodies, to nourish them. But if he saye well that Christes flesh was truely rosted vpō the crosse, because his body being broken on the crosse, was made meate for vs, although it were not rosted with fire, &amp;c. then may we rightly saye, that Christes body and bloud is truely eaten and dronken of vs by faith, although it be not put in at our mouthes, nor swallowed down our throtes, &amp;c. He saith

                     
                        
                           ••
                        was truly rosted on the crosse, and truly rising from death, to th
                           •
                         intent it might be truly eaten of vs. &amp;c. As truly as his flesh was rosted, so truely is it eaten: but we acknowledge no cooklike rosting, but a mystical preparation: euen so we beleeue no eating with champing, chawing, &amp; swallowing, but a mysticall and spirituall feeding and nourishing, of which wee are assured by the visible seales of bread and wine, which we eate and drinke bodily. After this, he alledgeth Gregorius Nyssenus in Orat. Cathe
                        •
                     . to proue that it is necessary, as ye poisoned apple was eaten of Adam to infect vs with original sinne, so, that the body of Christ be receiued into our body, as really by our mouths, as euer the apple came in the mouth of Adam. That he nameth not the 37. Chapiter, where such a matter is spoken of, it may be, the copy he saw, had no diuision of Chapiters: but rather I feare he suppressed it of fraude, because that Chapiter is confessed euen by Sonnius a Papiste, not to bee found in many copies of that Catheticall booke of Gregory: and in deede the argument of that part of ye oration which goeth before, and of that which followeth after, being of regeneration in baptisme, which argument is interrupted by this discourse of the supper, sheweth that it is foysted in by some late writer, which would haue the new doctrine of transubstantiation to bee credited vnder colour of the authority of this ancient father. For if Gregory had ben purposed to haue spoken of ye Lords supper in this booke of instruction, which he did write for to shewe the order and doctrine of Catechizing, he would first haue finished his treaty of baptisme and regeneration, and afterwarde haue descended to the other parte of Gods dispensation, which consisteth in preseruing and feeding his children that are borne vnto him, which grace is represented in the Lordes supper. I passe ouer yt Nicephorus testifieth, euen yt book in his time to haue bene corrupted by diuers heretiks &amp; Origenists by name, which corruption and diuersity of copies gaue some transubstantiator good hope, that his addition in such variety of bookes might happilye of some be accounted for the

authentical authoritie of Gregorie. And he was nothing deceiued. For M. Sander, whether he think it to be such, or onely would haue vs to acknowledge it for such, dissembling the vn certeintie thereof, which other papistes confesse; setteth it foorth, as the sounde and vndoubted authoritie of Gregorie Nyssene. As for his vaine cauilling, that the figure of a medicine healeth not, is foolish and absurde: for so he might reason, that baptisme is no medicine for originall sinne, but a figure of a medicine. We make not the sacraments figures of medicins, but outward signes of inward and spirituall healing. The vertue of cleansing sinnes, is not included in the water, no more then the spirituall feeding is in ye breade and wine. And more absurde it is, that hee chargeth vs with shadowes in the sacraments. And where he sayeth, that all spirituall giftes are inferiour to ye flesh of Christ being in our mouth: if he meane inferior in vtility, it is false: for by those spiritual gifts without that flesh, which he imagineth in our mouthes, ye Papists confesse, that we may be saued, but with that fleshe in our mouthes, by their owne doctrine, we may be damned.
                  From this place he beginneth to raue against Caluin, although he haue appointed a whole chapter following to confute his error. Caluines supper he sayth, in respect of Christs real substance, is but a meere sauour of sweete meates. As though Caluine did not acknoweledge that Christ is truly eaten of them, yt worthily receiue the sacraments. Beside this he chargeth Caluine, as one yt setteth forth the kingdom of the diuel, &amp; abaseth the kingdom &amp; gifts of God. Because he hath diligently &amp; eloquently set forth ye doctrin of mans fall &amp; dānation, but in ye doctrine of saluation &amp; renouation by Christ, he hath dealt faintly &amp; weakly. God be thāked, they which wil read Caluin of this point, wt indifferēt iudgemēt, wil cōfesse, yt he hath shewed no lesse diligence &amp; eloquence therin, then in the other. And wherfore hath he set forth y• one, but for the glorie of the other? And euen by those things which be not slanders in Sand, by which he saith he hath abased ye kingdō &amp; gift of God, he hath greatly

magnified the glorie thereof: which is, that all power, vertue, helpe, comfort, grace, &amp; giftes, come onely from God by the onely meanes of Iesus Christ. Hereof it is that Christes litle flocke is contemptous in the eyes of the worlde, that many are called and fewe are chosen, that his Church hath no sacrifice propitiatorie, no popish priesthood, no one sheepheard on earth, but onely the death, eternall priesthood, and greate sheephearde Iesus Christ. As for the colde supper, small offering of sufficient grace, baptisme like a sheepemarke, no authoritie to make lawes, no communion of Saintes, no reall ioyning and vniting with Christes fleshe and bloud in the holy mysteries, &amp;c. be Sanders lyes, and slanders; not Caluins assertions. After he hath railed a crash at Caluine, vnto whose felicitie this may be added, that he is slandered by so euill a person, as Sander is, he repeteth the diuerse suppers of Luther, Zwinglius, Caluine, ioyning to them also the fantasticall opinion of that epicurian gospeller, Carolastadius, and disseuering Caluine from Zwinglius, with whome he agreeth fully. And Caluines supper he saith, were good for Angels, to feede vpon immortall meate in their soules, but Christ hath giuen his bodie and bloud to be eaten and drunken of our bodies to feede on. Verily, euen as he hath giuen the holy ghost to wash vs body and soule from all our sinnes, and to regenerate vs to be the sonnes of God: Sander might say, if he would, this were a regeneration, or birth, good for Angels, that haue no bodies. For hee will not vnderstand, that both bodie and soule may bee nourished by spirituall foode, as well as both body &amp; soule borne a newe by a spirituall washing and engraffing into the body of Christ. But the Corinthians (saith he) had two faultes, both which the heretikes doe followe. The first fault, they came to it after they had eaten their owne supper, so the heretikes first deuise what supper they wil allowe Christ, and then they come to it, conforming it to their deuise. In deede so doe the Papistes. The second fault was, they did eate and drinke alone without making their meate common to the

poore: so the heretikes eate and drinke alone, teaching, that euery man eateth Christ onely by measure of his owne faith. Nay rather the Popishe heretikes eate and drinke all alone often times, not tarying for other to communicate with them, and alwaies they drinke all alone, giuing no parte to them that woulde drinke with them, which is worse then the Corinthians did: for they eate not their supper alone, which teach that Christe must be eaten of the whole Church together, requiring faith in euery man that shall receiue the Sacrament worthily. But Sander maketh Christ so liberall, that he giueth himselfe to all that sit at the table, riche or poore, good or badde. In deede, he offereth himselfe to al, but he giueth himself to none, but to such as receiue him thankefully, and which take profite by him: wherefore he saith, He that eateth mee, shal liue for me, whereupon it followeth inuincibly, that hee which liueth not for him, eateth him not. Neither sayth Hierom any thing contrarie to this, where he sayeth, that Christ hath giuen his body to be eaten, himselfe beeing the meate and the feaster or guest. True it is, that Christ alone in his death, was the priest, the Sacrifice, and the temple, or altar, not playing all partes, as Sander lewdly speaketh, but perfourming throughly in his owne person, whatsoeuer was necessarie for our full and perfect redemption, the seale and assurance whereof, with al benefites thereto belonging, he giueth vs in his holy supper, and not bare odours of spirituall grace, but a true communicating of his body and bloud vnto euerlasting life, of as many as with a true and liuely faith receiue it spiritually, as their bodies receiue the outwarde elements of bread and wine bodily. Like as in baptisme wee receiue not bare odours of spirituall grace, but are verily borne a newe, and ingraffed into the death, buriall, and resurrection of Christ, after a diuine and heauenly manner with forgiuenesse of our sinnes, euen as outwardly our bodies are sprinkled or washed with pure water. Wherefore, that which wee teache of the receiuing of the body and bloud of Christ by faith, is

no denying of the Lordes supper, but a cleare exposition and setting foorth of the same, according to the holy scriptures, and the institution of our Sauiour Christe himselfe.
               
               
                  CAP. VI.
                  
                     A speciall errour of Caluine is confuted, who taught, This is Sander. my body, which is giuen for you, to be wordes of promise, in the way of preaching at Christes supper, whereas they are wordes of performance in the way of working.
                  
                  The long babling, quarelling, and wrangling, that he vseth in this large Chapter, is grounded vpon one poore Fulke. sophistication of Sander, in disioyning those thinges, that are to be conioyned &amp; matched together. Namely, where Caluine saith, the saying of Christ to be wordes of promise: Sander presseth him to say, they be words of promise onely, where he sayeth expressely, that they are also wordes of perfourmance, as Sander himselfe translateth his words: They are a liuely preaching, which may shew his efficacie in accomplishment of that it promiseth. Is not efficacie in accomplishment, which is al one with perfourmance, here ioyned with promise? To omit therefore his railing against Caluine, for singularitie, &amp; against ye preachers of England, for following his fansie, &amp;c. let vs see, what mater he hath to bring against Caluins saying, yt those words are words of promise. First he cōfesseth, yt they are words of promise, fulfilling a promise made before, at Capernaū. Also they are words of promise, in respect of the death of Christ, which is promised in these words which is giuē for you, or, shalbe giuē for you, &amp;c. but this saying. This is my body, is no more words of promise, then the saying: This is my welbeloued sonne, which are wordes of witnesse, of a thing present. Then he will teache the difference betweene a promise and a perfourmance: a promise (sayth he) beginneth the bargaine, the perfourmance endeth it. Let it be so, that should proue the wordes of Christ to be a promise, whereof the perfourmance followeth vpon the conditions required.
                  
                     
In the institution of the supper, there is mention of a newe couenant. In euerie couenant there must be two parties at the least. Christ is one partie, but who is the other partie, will Master Sander saye? Euery man, or euery faithfull man onely? The newe testament is a couenant of forgiuenesse of sinnes, but forgiuenesse of sinnes is not obteined of all men, but onely of them that beleeue: therefore not all men, but only the faithfull are the other partie in this couenant. Wherefore, though the promise of eating of Christes body, euen as of forgiuenesse of sinnes, is offered by Christ generally to all men, yet the perfourmance is onely vnto the faithfull, which are the other partie of the couenant. Whereof it followeth, that the wicked men eat not the body of Christ, and so the words of Christ are wordes of promise, the perfourmance wherof was in them that did receiue faithfully, that which he offred. But the wordes of Christ (saith he) speake not of the time to come, but of the present time, ergo no promise. A sorie reason, by which he might proue, a thousand words of promise in the Scriptures, to be no wordes of promise, because they are spoken, not onely in the present time, but also in the time past. And yet the wordes of Christe must haue relation vnto the time to come. For Christ did not consecrate breade and wine into his body and bloud, but with purpose, that they should be eaten and drunken. And therefore hee biddeth them first eate &amp; drinke, and then sayeth, This is my body, this is my bloud, that is to saye, In eating and drinking this bread and this cuppe, you shall eate and drinke my bodye and bloud: Therefore, in these wordes, This is my bodie: the couenant is not ended, as Sander sayeth, vntill that which is offred on the one partie, be accepted on the other partie. Where he affirmeth, that wordes of promise, consist in bare talke, he giueth a bare iudgement of the promises of God, which are effectuall in worke, although they bee vttered in wordes. And when hee sayeth, they haue no condition, or delaye annexed, it is vntrue, although it bee not necessarie,

that euery promise should haue a condition, for many promises are made absolutely. But Gods promises require the condition of faith, in them that shall obteine the performance of them, and so doeth this. And therefore the promise of spirituall communicating, (which Sander obiecteth) helpeth not Iudas, because he receiueth it not with faith. Sander asketh Caluine, whether the condition of faith, be written in the supper or no: If not, how dare Caluine supply it? Hath he not choked Caluine with this question, trowe you? But if Caluine can finde a couenant in the supper, he wil not seeke farre off, to finde faith, necessarily required in the receiuers thereof. But he hath two other reasons against ye promise, one of the worde, This; another of the worde, Is. This (saith he) sheweth where the thing is, that it pointeth vnto. The body of Christ is promised, &amp; also pointed vnto. If the worde, This, be such a pointer, I praye you syr, where is that which is pointed vnto, when hee saith of the cuppe: This is the newe testament in my bloud? Was that which seemed the cuppe, or that in the cupp the newe testament, which was pointed vnto? If it were a sacrament or seale of the newe testament, confirmed in his bloud which was shed for vs, then was the other a Sacrament or seale of the newe testament, confirmed in the breaking and giuing of his body for vs. It angreth Sander, that Caluine should: say Christ saying, This is my body, speaketh not to the bread, but to his disciples, wherein he would make him so singular, that not onely the Papistes, but also all Lutherans &amp; Zwinglians, do confesse the wordes to be spoken to the bread, which is a shamefull lye, both of the Lutherans &amp; of the Zwinglians, for none of them is so madde, to thinke that when he began to speake to his disciples, and saye: Take and eate, then he turned his tale from them, and spake to the breade, when he saide: This is my body, &amp; then againe to his disciples, when he saide, which is giuen for you: For, if hee had spoken to the bread, hee would haue saide, thou art my body, and not, this is my body, which is of the thirde person. And to put all out

of doubt, S. Mark saith, speaking of the cuppe, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and he said vnto them, This is my bloud. If he spake not to the wine, but to his disciples, when he said, this is my bloude, then surely hee spake not to the breade, but to his disciples, of the breade: when he said, This is my bodie. Marke this well, for although it bee but a small matter, yet it ouerthroweth the whole mysterie of Popish Consecration. The argument of this verbe, est, is, taketh for proofe, that which is in controuersie, namely, that it is put properlie, because it is indeede Christes bodie, when the wordes are spoken. But seeing by your owne diuinitie, it is not the bodie of Christ, before the laste syllable, vm, bee pronounced, howe coulde the Verbe est, bee taken properly: when neither before it was spoken, nor while it was in speaking, the bodie of Christ was made of breade? But Sander will knowe, by what Scriptures, Caluine proueth his lewde interpretation: As though Caluine affirmeth any thing, of this matter, which hee prooueth not plentifully by the scriptures, which are of the nature of Sacraments generally: and of this Sacrament especially, of the nature of the humanitie of Christ, &amp; of manie tropicall speeches, vsed throughout the scriptures, which hee that wil, may read at large in his writings. In the meane time, let vs see, how Sander doth confute his fond opinion by the word of God.
                  The first argumēt of confutation, is gathered of ye present tēps, vsed in these words: This is my body, which agreeth not with the nature of a promise, which is a prediction of a thing to come. I haue before answered this lewd argumēt: for al promises are not vttered in ye future temps: Esay saith, Puer natus est nobis, a child is born vnto Esay. 9. vs, when he was not borne, 500. yeares after. I haue shewed before, that the words, This is my bodie, haue relatiō to ye eating which followed after they were vttered. Caluine saith further, yt Christ speaketh not to ye bread, that it should be made his bodie: But he cōmaundeth his disciples to eate, &amp; promiseth them ye cōmunicating of his bodie &amp; bloud. Against this, Sander replieth, yt 
                     God said to his

disciples, take, eate, which is a commandement, and no promise: He saith further, This is my body, that is, ye making of the meate, which must be eaten, &amp; the shewing of it, but no promise. S. Paul saith, 1. Cor. 10. The bread which we breake, is it not the communicating of the body of Christ? Who dare say the cō
                     trarie? But is the bread which we breake, an actual communicating of the bodie of Christ, before we eate it? No verily. Howe is then the bread that we break, a communicating of the bodie of Christ, before we eate it, but by promise of communicating to them, that shal eat it faithfully? And if these words, This is my bodie, be not words of promise, of cōmunicating his bodie, what other words of promise, can Sander shew in the institution? But nowe will Sander prooue at large, that Christ spake not to his disciples, when he saide, This is my bodie: but to the breade. Although I haue alreadie prooued, out of the words of S. Marke, that Christ spake to his disciples, so plainely, that Sanders eares may gloe on his heade for shame, to reade it: yet will I consider all his particular argumēts, by which he taketh vpon him to prooue, that Christ spake to the breade.
                  The first reason, Christ speaketh somtimes to vnsensible creatures: as to the windes, ye figtree, and all creatures heere ye voyce of God, whē he speaketh to thē, so he speaketh heere, to the bread. If this consequent, did hange to the Antecedent by any necessity, I would grant it; otherwise I must denie it. Well, yet thus much is gained, that it is not absurde, that Christ should speake to the breade, being a senseles creature. yes verie absurd, that beginning to speake to men, he should sodenly make an apostrophe to bread, and without any transition, but euen with a relatiue, as sodenlie return to speak to men. And yt speaking to bread, he should vse no word of ye second persō, which he vseth, in speaking to the Winds, &amp; to the Figtree.
                  The second reason beginneth thus: Caluine saith, Christ spake not to the bread I tell him, he spake to the breade, not as to a thing which shoulde carrie bread, but as to that which shoulde be chaunged into his bodie: For he called the bread his bodie. Is not this a magistrall, or doctorall kinde of reasoning? I tell

him (quoth Sander) it is so: but how proueth he yt Christ spake to the bread, because he called it his bodie? Which if Caluine wil denie, hee hath it readie out of Tertullian, aduer. Marc. lib. 4. Panem corpus suum appellat: He calleth the bread his bodie. But we cannot call a thing, except we speake vnto it. Therfore when Christ called the bread his bodie, he spake vnto the breade, as if he had said vnto the bread, be thou my bodie. Who woulde haue thought it? Sander cannot call a stone, a stone, but he speaketh to a stone: nor a shouell, a shouell, but hee speaketh to a shouell. And with Sander, it is all one, to say: This is a shouell, or a stone, and be thou a shouell, or a stone. Nay, he will say, with God, calling and making is all one, where he will make one thing of another. In deede that is another matter. If this will of God coulde be prooued, of the bread to make his naturall bodie, calling and making might be one, and yet it woulde not followe, that Christ intending to turne breade into his naturall bodie, by these wordes: This is my bodie, coulde not doe it, except hee spake to the bread.
                  But nowe let vs see, howe hee proueth, that Christ made the breade, his naturall bodie. First, Ambrose writeth de iis qui myst. init. Cap. 9. Ante bene dictionem &amp;c. Before the blessing of the heauenly wordes, it is named another kinde, after consecration, the bodie is signified. He himselfe nameth it his bloude. Before consecration, it is named another thing, after consecration it is called bloude. And thou sayest, Amen: that is, it is true. That which the mouth speaketh, let the inwarde minde confesse. That which the speech soundeth, let the affection feele. Out of these wordes, Sander saith, that it is euident, that Christ spake to the breade and wine; but by what reason, I cannot deuise: and that the making of them, is in deede so as they are called and signified, because the people answered, Amen. I graunt the breade and wine, are made sacraments, to signifie the bodie and bloude of Christe, and that is it, which the people confesse, if Ambrose expounde the words of Christ truely, when hee saith, that the bodie of Christ is signified after consecration by that which was called breade and wine

before the words of blessing, and afterward is called the body and bloud of Christ. This 1. witnesse speaketh not so much against him, but Tertullian, his second witnesse speaketh much more. Acceptum panem &amp; distributum discipulis, corpus suum illum fecit: Hoc est corpus meum, dicendo, id est, figura corporis mei. He made the breade which was taken, and distributed to the disciples, his bodie, saying: This is my bodie, that is to say, the figure of my bodie. Loe hee made the breade his bodie. Wee confesse, but howe his bodie? That is to say, a figure of his bodie: but beeing a figure stoppeth not the reall trueth of his bodie (saieth hee): no more then Christ, being a figure, printe or forme, of his fathers substance, which is yet also his substance in deede. What sayest thou, Sabellian heretike? Is not Christ a distinct hypostasis, from his father, because hee is Homousion of the same substance, and is not that proued, because hee is Character substantiae patris? And yet there is great difference in comparing the persons of the diuinitie, with the figures of Christ. Yea saieth Sander, There can bee no more grosse, more vile, more blasphemous opinion, then to thinke that Christ is a bare man: &amp;c. Or that his figures are like the figures of the olde Lawe. And againe, looke what oddes is betweene God and man, so much beleeue thou to bee betweene his naming, or his figures of the newe Testament, and all other figures. Why Sander, were the namings in the old Testament of man, and not of GOD? Were the figures instituted of man, and not of God? Yea, were they not instituted of Christe himselfe? If they were instituted of God, howe followeth thy beastly conclusion, of the difference, or oddes of figures, and naming of the newe Testament, and figures, and namings of the olde Testament? The rocke was Christ, it was a figure and naming of the olde Testament, so named and instituted by Christ himselfe, why shoulde there be more transubstantiation of the breade, then of the rocke? except as thou wast euen nowe a Sabellian, so in this thou art a Marcionite, that beleeuest another GOD, and Christ of the newe Testament,

then was of the old Testament.
                  Augustine, speaking of the figures of the old Testament, and comparing them with the figures of the newe Testament, sayeth, 
                        Sacramenta illa fuerunt, in signis diuersa sunt, in re quae significatur paria sunt. Those were sacraments, they are diuerse in signes, but in the thinge which is signified, they are equall. 
                     in Ioan. 6. Tr. 26. Ouer, and beside this, examining Tertullian, let vs aske him, what did Christ distribute to his disciples? Hee will answere panem, breade. Againe, howe made hee the breade his bodie? hee answereth, hee made it a figure of his bodie. Yea saieth Sander, the Sacrament is a figure of Christes bodie: because it sheweth his death vntill hee come.
                  But what is the sacrament with you Papistes? The naturall body of Christe. Then the naturall body of Christe, is a figure of the body of Christe: if this bee not shamelesse trifling, I report mee to you. Tertullian is a good expounder to interprete the name of Corpus, by figura Corporis, if Corpus bee taken properly. But to proceede. The next reason to proue that Christ spake to the breade, is this: The Sacrament is a sacrifice, ye acte which offereth it, and voweth it, perteineth as well to the thing offered, as vnto God, to whom it is offered: as when a Lambe is offered, God in the Lambe is honoured, prayed vnto, blessed, thanked, and praysed. I omitte these straunge phrases: God is prayed to, in a Lambe. &amp;c. But speake plainely Sander, if thou darest: is the Lambe spoken vnto, when it is saide, This is the Passeouer: This is the bloude of the couenant, which God hath made with you? For thou must not thinke, to reason with men in such sort, as boyes woulde not suffer thee to passe. The acte of sacrificing perteyneth to the thing offered: therefore the thing offered is spoken vnto. But howe prouest thou, that this Sacrament is a sacrifice? Because, it is the remembrance of that great sacrifice, made by his death vpon the crosse, It must also needes partake that nature, whereof it is a remembrance: and consequently, it must bee certainely beleeued, to bee

a true sacrifice, as that of the crosse was. Who will grant, or how canst thou proue, the maior of this argument, Euery remembrance must partake the nature of that, wherof it is a remembrance? Is the remembrance of a man, a man? or the remembrance of God, God? or to pose thee in thine owne popery, is the memory of a Masse, as you call it, a Masse? But that reason cannot proue, authority shall enforce. First Irenaeus lib. 5. ad Haereses saith, that when the bread broken and the mixed chalice percipis verbion dei, the eucharistie of the body &amp; bloud of Christ is made. The bread (saith Sander) cannot take the word, which is not directed to it. Yes, as well as all creatures are sanctified by the word of God, spoken by God to men, and by praier directed to God by men, and not to ye creatures yt are eaten &amp; dronken. The same Irenaeus, is cited lib. 4. Cap. 34. saying, 
                        Panis percipiens vocationem dei, bread receiuing the calling of God, is not now common bread, but the eucharistie consisting of two thinges, earthly and heauenly. If vocation be not here taken for inuocation, or calling vpon God, as it is most like, yet at least, it is taken for the vertue of Gods word, which it may receiue, although the word be directed to men, and not to bread. But the earthly thing wherof the sacrament consisteth, (saith Sander) is the old forme of breade, as though accidents without the subiect and substance of earth, be earthly. Secondly the heauenly thing is the body of Christ: this is true, if he ment as Irenaeus meaneth, the body of Christ, the diuine vertue and efficacy of Christes body sacrificed, for our redemption. But as he vnderstandeth it, for the naturall body of Christ: like as it is monstrous to affirme that the form or shape of bread is an erthly matter: so is it hereticall and anabaptisticall, to say, that the naturall body of Christ is an heauenly matter or substance.
                  The second authority is, Iustinus in Apol. 2. Cibū qui per verbum precationis, &amp;c. Wee haue learned that the foode which is consecrated by the worde of praier, which wee tooke of him, to be the fleshe and bloud of Iesus Christ. He yeldeth

the wordes of Iustinus, who interlaceth this Parenthefis next to the worde, Foode, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , of which foode our bloude, and flesh by transmutation, are nourished: which confuteth transubstantiation, and carnall eating. But to the matter in question. This worde of prayer (saith Sander) can bee none other, but, This is my bodie: as though Christ hath not taught vs to frame our prayers, but by that saying. But see the conclusion that will followe, admitting these wordes, This is my bodie, to bee wordes of prayer: Then are they not wordes of performance: for prayer and performance differ as much as promise, and performance. Againe, when Sander saieth, they are not wordes of preaching, because they are wordes of prayer: for preaching is directed principally to the people, and prayer onely to GOD. Marke the conclusion. If they bee wordes of prayer, and wordes of prayer bee directed onely to God: then are they not directed to the bread.
                  The like may be gathered of that hee saieth, that they bee wordes of sacrifice, which were Idolatrie, to direct to any but to God: and therefore chargeth Caluine with horrible Idolatrie, for directing them to the people, not remembring that it is as great Idolatrie, to directe them to the breade, if they were wordes of sacrifice. But they are directed finallie to GOD (saieth hee) as though wordes of preaching, were not finallie directed to GOD: and by the way of sacrificing, they appertaine to the breade, as though wordes of sacrificing appertaine not to the people, for whome the sacrifice is offered, as much and more, then to the thing that is sacrificed. For what is a sacrifice of an Oxe, or a Calfe (of which hee taketh similitudes) but a figuratiue preaching? Hath any man so greate leasure to confute such insensible arguments?
                  But Hierom ad Euag. tom. 2. sayeth, that at the praiers of Priestes, the bodie and bloud of Christe is made. Doubtlesse at none other prayers (saieth Sander)

then wherein they saye, with minde of sacrificing ouer breade, This is my bodie: &amp;c. seeing his argument is nothing else, but doubtlesse, wee may not doubt vppon it. A straunge prayer, wherein nothing is asked, and hee that prayeth, speaketh not in his owne person, but in the person of another. But August. saith in Psal. 39. The performance of things promised, hath taken away ye promising words, I wil giue, is a word of promise; I haue giuen, is a word of performance. The Euāgelists testifie, yt Christ hath giuen, therfore his words are not wordes of promise. I answere, The Euangelistes testifie, that Christ gaue bread, which he brake, and gaue vnto his disciples, promising the communicating of his body, to them that did eat it faithfully, in saying, this is my body which is broken for you: the condition of faithfull receiuing, required in all Gods couenantes, must needes be included in this, although in euery place where mention therof is made, it be not expressed.
                  From this matter, he returneth to the former talke of sacrifice. These wordes (saith he) fulfill the act of sacrifice, and therfore they are called of Iustinus Martyr 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the worde of prayer, or vowe. It is false that he saith that Iustine calleth these words, This is my body, wordes of praier, or vow: for he saith, the food to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that for which thankes is giuen by worde of praier: yet Augustine saith Ep. 59. Vouentur, &amp;c. Al things are vowed which are offered to God, specially the oblation of the holy altar. And againe, Orationes. &amp;c. We take praiers to be saied, when that which is on the Lords table, is blessed and sanctified and broken to be distributed. This blessing and sanctifiing (saith Sander) is made by praier, that praier is vowing to God of bread and wine: let all this be granted, what followeth? The word of vowing, is to say ouer it, This is my body. That is the matter in controuersie, which with Sander, is alwaies a good argument, but yet remaineth to be proued. But now we must see ye difference betwen Caluine &amp; the old fathers. Augustine calleth the Sacrament an oblation. Irenaeus li. 4. Ca. 32. witnesseth that Christ hauing taken bread and giuen thankes, said. This

is my body, and confessed the chalice to be his bloud, and taught a new oblation of the new testament, which also he prooueth out of Malachie the Prophet. Caluine will haue no working vpon the breade, but onely in the mindes of the hearers, and neither praier, nor vowe, nor sacrifice, in these wordes. Neither hath Sander prooued, that in these wordes, is either praier, vow, or sacrifice. Neuerthelesse, Caluine acknowledgeth, the celebration of the supper to be such an oblation as the fathers vnder stoode, namely a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, and not of attonement for sinnes. For thus writeth Irenaeus: 
                        Noui testamenti docuit oblationem quam ecclesia ab Apostolis accipiens, in vniuerso mundo offert deo, ei qui alimenta nobis praestat primitias suorum munerum, &amp;c. He taught the oblation of the newe testament, which the Church receiuing from the Apostles, offereth to God through out the whole worlde, euen to him which giueth foode vnto vs, the first fruites of his giftes. Here is no oblation of the body and bloud of Christ, but thanksgiuing vnto God for his benifites. And what the sacrifice foreshewed by Malachie was, he expoundeth out of S. Iohn, in the Apocalipse, the praiers of the saintes. Cap. 35. Also Cap. 34. expounding what is that pure sacrifice foreshewed by Malachie, and taught by Christ, he saith: 
                        Oportet enim nos oblationem deo facere, &amp; in omnibus gratos inueniri fabricatori deo, in sententia pura, &amp; fide sine hypocrisi, in spe firma, in dilectione feruenti, primitias earum quae sunt eius creaturarum offerentes: &amp; hanc oblationem Ecclesia solapuram offert fabricatori, offerens ei cum gratiarum actione ex creatura eius. For we must make this oblation to God, and in all things be found thankefull to God our maker in a pure mynd, and faith without hypocrisie, in stedfast hope and feruent loue, offering the first fruites of those creatures which are his: and this pure oblation, the Church a lone offereth to her maker, offering to him of his owne creature, with thanksgiuing. Thus writteth Irenaeus of the sacrifice of the Church, which cannot stand with the Popish sacrifice, of Christes naturall body and bloud.
                  And whatsoeuer Gregory Nyss. Chrysostome, or Ambrose

write, of changing the bread, consecrating of the things set forth, working of Christes words, hath none other meaning, but of the spirituall changing, consecrating, and working of God, in the worthy receiuers of this sacrament, as in more proper places, shall be shewed out of euery one of them.
                  The next argument to prooue that Christe spake to the bread, is of the custom of the East Church, in which, the people answered Amen, when the words of consecration were pronounced alowde, which he proueth out of Ambrose. The same appeareth in Augustine sermone ad insants, which proueth, that it was the custome of the Latine Church in those daies, to pronounce the words openlv: for Ambrose and Augustine were both of the West or Latine Church, and therefore the fecret whispering of the Popish Church, is prooued to be but new, in comparison, belike inuented since transubstantiation came to towne, and therefore that custome prooueth nothing worth the answering, howsoeuer Sander prefer it before the custome of the elder Church. To the which I answer, that Amen may be said, as well to wordes of promise, and more properly, then to wordes of performance. For Amen, doth not only affirm a thing to be so, but also wisheth that it may be so.
                  But now, there is another ancient custome, witnessed by Irenaeus out of Euseb. lib. 5. Cap. 24. who reproouing Victor bishop of Rome, for excōmenicating the Churches of Asia, dissenting from him in the celebration of Easter, affirmeth that Soter, Anicetus, Pius, Higinus, Telesphorus, and Xystus, vsed solemnely to sende the Eucharisty to those preists, who came out of those quarters, where Easter was kept otherwise then it was it Rome. Ergo (saith he) the sacrament is a corporall reall thing, which may be preserued, caried, sent vp and down, and so at last receiued. And so consequently, the wordes in question, are words of performance, and not of promise. Although the consequence is not sure, yet the foundation of this whole argument is nought. For

Irenaeus sayeth not, that the Sacrament was preserued, carryed, sent vp and downe, but that it was sent solemnly vnto strangers, not into forreine countries, but to such as came to Rome, neither doeth hee saye, that it was sent vnto their lodginges or Innes, but for any thing that he sayeth, it was sent vnto them, beeing present at the time of distribution and celebration of the supper: for he sayeth before: 
                        Nunquam tamen ob hoc repulsi sunt ab Ecclcsiae societate, aut venientes ab illis paribus non sunt suscepti. Yet were they neuer for this repulsed from the societie of the Church, or comming from those partes, were not receiued. And afterwarde hee sheweth, that Anicetus did giue place vnto Polycarpus, permitting him to minister the Communion, as one whome he honoured. So that no reseruation, nor sending vp and downe, is heereof prooued, other then sending the communion by the Deacons, about the Church, as their custome was. But Iustinus sayth expressely, that it was sent vnto them which were absent, by the Deacons, which had no power to consecrate, and therefore Caluine reprooueth that custome for an abuse.
                  But for as much as Iustinus maketh mention before of the collation of almes, which was also blessed, and that he affirmeth, that the Deacous carried it, is not vnlike, but that this carriage might be of bread and wine, which was then offered in greate quantitie, to the reliefe of such poore, as beeing letted by sicknesse or imprisonment, coulde not be present, at the holy assemblies. Or if you will needes vnderstande, that which was sent to be the sacrament, although the Deacons might not consecrate, yet might they declare the vertue and force of the consecration, and the vse of the Sacrament, vnto such as they did carie it, from the congregation, with which, those that vpon necessarie cause were absent, were present in spirite, &amp; might communicate more tollerably, then they which among ye Papists, when thei haue no let, refuse to cōmunicate wt the priest,

and after in sicknesse receiue their masse cake, communicating with none at all. Neuerthelesse, it cannot be denyed, but such carrying of the sacrament, if it were vsed in the eldest Church, was an abuse, because it hath none allowance in the holy Scriptures of Christes institution, but a commaundement to the contrarie: for these wordes, Take and eate, bee wordes of commaunding: therefore keeping and sending, which are contrarie to these, cannot be defended, howsoeuer they might be excused. Wherefore, it is without reason, that Caluine is charged with intollerable pride, for finding fault with the primitiue Church, and bringing no reason of his reprouing. For Caluine opposeth the commaundement of Christ, the end of the institution, which he worthily calleth the trueth, against any custome, of any man, how good soeuer he were. Cyprian sayeth, wee must not regarde what any man hath done before vs, but what Christ, which is before all, hath done and commanded to be done. lib. 2 Ep. 3. The custome of ministring with water, was ancient, and vsed in the primitiue Church, by some (as it should seeme by Cyprian) otherwise godly men. But he concludeth against it, 
                        Neque hominis consuetudinem sequi oportet, sed Dei veritatem; Neither must we followe the custome of man, but the trueth of God. It is therefore a fault, to keepe the sacramentall bread and wine, or to sende it about, because Christ hath neither done nor commanded it to be done, but the contrarie, to be eaten and dronken. This reason of Cyprian is Caluins reason, of whose writinges, Sander willeth all men to take heede: and yet he sayeth, they shall finde in them neither learning nor honestie. If there be no learning in them, there is no great danger of hurt by reading of them. I marueile, what that is, which you Papistes call learning: for if it be knowledge of sciences, of tongues, of auncient writinges, of things past, of things present, weight in reasoning, eloquence in vttering, power in reprouing, or whatsoeuer was in olde time accounted for learning, I trust al indifferent men will confesse, that great steppes therof may

be found in Caluins writing. But if learning be nothing else with Papists, but that which they fantasie thēselues to knowe, there is none learned but Papistes. Whereas Sander threatneth vpon the defence of Caluins supposed error, taken in hand by any of his scholers, to discouer more of the ignorance of their arrogant Master, if hee can haue so much leisure from his traiterous practises in Ireland, which he hath lately taken in hand, vnder the seruice of his diuelish blasphemous &amp; antichristian master, the Pope, I wish him not to spare: not doubting, but as I haue so discouered his proude, and yet blockish ignorance, in this Chapter, in such sort as his friendes will blush to read it, although he be past shame himselfe: so in any matter, wherein the Church of England doth cō
                     sent with Caluins writing, I shalbe able by Gods helpe, so to defende the trueth, that all his much babling, trifling, quarrelling, controlling, lying, railing, shal turne to his owne confusion, and the reproche of the Baby lonicall strompet, which he laboureth, both with penne and sworde, tongue and hand, both like an heretike &amp; a traitor, to protest and maintaine against the church of God.

                  CAP. 1.
                  
                     The Catholikes require their cause to be vprightly tryed by the Sander. holy scriptures, which they haue alwaies studied &amp; reuerenced.
                  
                  
                     THis request is reasonable, if it were Fulke. faithfully meant, but it is nothing but an heretical bragge, because you seeme to haue colour in the holy scriptures, for your carnall, and as you call it, real presence, otherwise, what studie soeuer you haue followed in your closets, your open writings declare small reuerence vnto the holy Scriptures. For Pigghius one of them, whome you name to haue conuinced these heresies in our dayes, by holy scripture, calleth

the holy Scripture a nose of waxe, and a dumbe Iudge. These I weene be wordes of small reuerence. Eckius, another of them, calleth the Scripture, a blacke Gospell, and an inkish diuinitie. And Hosius, a thirde man sayeth, these wordes of our Sauiour Christ, Drinke ye all of this, if they be vnderstoode generally, aswell of lay men as of Priestes, to bee the expresse wordes of the diuell, and that there is no worde in all the Scripture of power to saue, but one onely worde, Dilige.
                  
                  And generally, all Papistes, which before our time, and in our dayes, haue taken vpon them the exposition of the holy Scriptures, submitting the vnderstanding of them to the Popes determination, declare, that they reuerence them not as the holye worde of God, but esteeme them as a leaden rule, which they maye drawe to any thing that shall please them. The absuide and lewde interpretations of many of the Popes, and other their applesquires, whereof the subtiler Papists in these dayes, are ashamed, woulde fill a large volume, if I shoulde goe about to rehearse them. The best excuse that Harding can finde for many of them, is that they are spirituall daliance (in the diuels name) by which you may see, what reuerence they beare to the holy scriptures, that make them an argument of daliance.
               
               
                  CAP. II.
                  
                     It is proued by the worde of God, that euill men receiue the Sander. bothe of Christ in his supper.
                  
                  The Apologie against which Sander fighteth, professeth, That in the supper (vnto such as beleeue) there is Fulke. truely giu en the body and bloud of the Lorde. Sander replyeth, that Iudas receiued the body of Christ, ergo not onely they that beleeue. Concerning Iudas, it is a question, whether he receiued the Sacrament or no. Not only because, as Sander confesseth, that some ancient fathers thought that hee went out before the supper, namely, Hilarius 
                        in Math, Can. 30. Post que Iudas pr

                           y

iudicaur, sine quo Pascha accepto calice &amp; fracto pane conficitur. After which thinges Iudas is declared to be a traitour, without whome the Passeouer is made, the cuppe being taken, and the bread being broken: But also by consequence of Sanders owne confession in lib. 1, Cap. 4. fol. 18. where hee affirmeth, that Christe did institute the Sacrament after he had eaten the Paschall Lamb, washed his disciples feete, and then sate downe againe to supper. But S. Iohn testifieth, that Iudas departed immediatly after the soppe receiued, which was before supper was ended. For this soppe could not be the sacrament, (as Augustine thinketh) seeing the worde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      signifieth a soppe dipped in brothe, and so was this soppe dipped in the platter, and not in the cuppe. But to admitte that Iudas was present, and did receiue the Sacrament; howe proueth hee, that hee receiued the bodie of Christe? That which Christe deliuered, Iudas receiued: Christ deliuered his body, ergo Iudas receiued his bodie. Neither the maior nor the minor of this argument, is out of controuersie. For Iudas receiued not whatsoeuer Christ deliuered: for Christ deliuered a spirituall communication of his body, as Saint Paul witnesseth to them that woulde receiue it, which Iudas receiued not: therefore the maior is false. The minor taketh as graunted, that whereof is all the controuersie: namely, that Christ deliuered his bodie vnder the formes of bread, which we deny, affirming that hee gaue bread into their handes, and his bodie after a spirituall manner, to them which receiued it by faith.
                  The Apologie further affirmeth, the Papists to teach the verie body of Christ to be eaten substantially, not onely of wicked men, but also (which is horrible to speake) of mise and dogges. Sander answereth, that it is not worthe the while to discusse, whether mise &amp; dogs, in some sense eate the body of Christ, because the Catholiks kepe it so warily, yt neither mouse nor dog may com nigh it: wherin he controlleth the scholemen, who haue long disputations &amp; doctorall determinations of that question. In the end he thinketh it worse, yt wicked men

shoulde eate, then if dogges or mise should eate it. But in deede they are both blasphemous absurdities. As for the fathers, whome he quoteth, for wicked mens eating of the body of Christ, we shal consider in the next Chapter, which is proper for that title. His next argument is out of S. Paul: whosoeuer shall eat this breade, and drinke this cupp of the Lorde vnworthily, shalbee guiltie of the bodie and bloud of the Lord. Of this text he reasoneth thus: vnworthie eating, supposeth an eating. It is verie true: but Saint Paul calleth it eating of this bread, and not eating of this bodie. Yea, saith Sander, Saint Paul doeth warily describe that kind of bread, both with an article and a Pronoune: ergo that breade is the bodie of Christ. I denie that argument. The article and the Pronoune, shewe that it is not common breade, but the sacrament of the bodie and bloud of Christ. But howe can hee which eateth this bread vnworthily, bee guiltie of the bodie of Christ, which he eateth not? Verie well. For he which abuseth the Kings seale, is guiltie of ye kings Maiestie, which he acknowledgeth not. But this argument out of Saint Paul, hee referreth vnto another time, returning againe to Iudas. That thinge whereof Christ saide to the twelue, Take, eate, and drinke, was taken, eaten, and dronken of all the twelue, and was but one thing onely concerning eating and drinking, that is his body and bloud: therefore Iudas did eat the same that Peter, Iames, and Iohn did.
                  Wee heard in the last Chapiter of the first booke, that it consisted of two things, by ye iudgement of Irenaeus, an earthly sub stance, and an heauenly, the one all receiued, the other onely the faithfull, therefore, the antecedent of this argument is false. But if that argument be not plaine ynough, wee must take another. Iudas and Iohn did eate one thing: Eche of them, that foode, whereof Christe sayde, this is my body: but Iohn did truely eate Christes bodie: ergo Iudas did truely eate Christes body. I aunswere, the maior is ambiguous, for if one foode bee taken for one breade, it is true, but if one thing bee taken for the bodye of

Christ, it is the matter in controuersie, and denyed of vs. Likewise the Minor is ambiguous. For if ye vnderstande eating of Christs bodie truly, eating by faith spiritually, it is true, and as the Apologie meaneth: if you vnderstande eating Christes bodie carnallie, it is false, and denyed of the Apologie, that Iohn did so eate the bodie of Christ. The argument is no better then this: Iudas and Iohn, did heare one Gospel each of them, that whereof it is saide, that it is the power of God to saluation: But Iohn did heare the Gospel to his saluation: ergo Iudas did heare the Gospel to his saluation. But Sander cauelleth, of deliuering of bakers breade, and nothing else, but Bakers breade. Christ offereth two thinges, earthly breade, and his diuine bodie. Nowe if Iudas receiue the one, and refuse the other, what folly is it to reason, of Christes deliuering? which is like as if a man will deliuer an obligation as his deede, and the partie that shoulde receiue it, will not receiue it, but as a scrolle, and so renteth it in peeces. In deede therefore Christ offereth his bodie to all men: but they onely receiue it, which beleeue. But eating by faith, (saith Sander) is a preparation to worthie eating, but the meate is all one, euen as the baptisme is all one, to the wicked and to the godly. I will aske no better example, then of the Sacrament of Baptisme, where indeede, the water, which is the outwarde element, is common to all that are sprinkeled or washed, as the breade is to all that eate: but regeneration, the thing signified by the water, is proper onely to the electe of GOD: Euen so the bodie of Christ, which is the thing signified by the breade, is not receiued but of them, which beleeue vnto eternall life.
               
               
                  CAP. III.
                  
                     The ancient fathers teach, that euill men receiue truely the bodie Sander. of Christ.
                  
                  The first father cited, is Origen, in Psalme. 37. who Fulke.
                     
                     
                        •
                     aith: that those which come to the Eucharistie, without examining and clensing themselues, are like to men sicke of an ague, who presuming to eate sanorum cibos, the meats of whole men, do hurt themselues. Whereupon Sander gathereth, that the meat of the supper, which is prouided for whole men, is truly, but not profitably eaten of the wicked. But that Origen was of no such iudgment, it is manifest by his expresse wordes, spoken of the eating of the sacrament, &amp; of the eating of the thing signified by the sacrament. In 
                        Math. Chap. 15. 
                        Et haec quidem de typico symbolicóque corpore. Multa porrò &amp; de ipso veróo dici possunt quod factum est caro verusque cibus, quem qui comederit omninò viuet in aeternu

Many thinges also may be spoken of the worde himselfe, which was made fleshe and very meate, which whosoeuer shall eate, vndoutedly he shall liue for euer, which no euill man can eate. For if it were possible yt he which continueth still euill, should eate the worde which is made flesh, seing he is the word and ye bread of life, it had not beene written: Whosoeuer shal eate this bread, shall liue for euer.
                  
                  The second father is Basil: de baptismo, lib. 1. Cap. vlt. Asking what shall a man say of him, who dareth in vaine and vnprofitably, eate the body and drinke the bloude of our Lorde Iesus Christ? To this I answere, that Basil speaketh not of wicked men, but of the faithfull, in whome the spirit of God was, and yet a great worke of mortification: therefore it followeth, after the wordes cited by Sander, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , &amp;c. and therefore much more giuing the holye spirite. They are not wicked, in whome the holy spirit is. Therefore the Aduerbes, Idely and vnprofitably, are not spoken simplie, but comparatiuely, for, not so diligently as they ought, not so profitably as they might.
                  
                     
The thirde father is Cypriane, de Coen. Domini. The sacraments for their part, cannot bee without their proper vertue, neither doth Gods maiesty by any meanes absent it selfe, from the mysteries. But albeit the sacraments permit themselues to be taken, or touched of vnworthie men, yet those men cannot bee partakers of the spirite, whose infidelitie or vnworthinesse withstandeth such holinesse. This authoritie is flatte against Sander: the wicked may receiue the Sacramentes, but not the spirite of Christ, if not the spirite, then not the bodie, for Christ his bodie, is neuer disseuered from his spirite.
                  The fourth father is Hierome: but where, hee sheweth not. Opponis mihi, &amp;c. Thou layest vnto mee the one measure of Manna called Gomor, and wee take the bodie of Christe equallie. According to the merites of them that receiue, that which is one is made diuerse. &amp;c. The Sacrament is one in it selfe &amp;c. There is no question, but that the wicked are partakers of the Sacrament, which is called the bodie of Christe, but of the bodie of Christ in deede, they are not partakers. For it cannot, bee truely saide, of the naturall bodie of Christ, that it is made diuerse, but the Sacrament which is called his bodie, is made diuerse, according to the faith or infidelitie of him that receiueth it.
                  Augustine is the fifte witnesse: In Epist. 162. Tolerat &amp;c. Our Lorde him selfe beareth with Iudas, hee suffereth a deuill, a thieefe, and the seller of himselfe, to receiue among the innocent disciples, that which the faithfull knowe, our price. Nothing is our price (saieth Sander) but the bodie of Christ. Yet may the Sacrament bee called our price, as it is called the bodie of Christ, for as touching that Iudas receiued not the same with the rest of the Apostles, Augustine sheweth in Ioan. Tract. 59. Illi manducabant panem Dominum, ille panem domini contra dominum. They did eate that breade which was the Lorde, hee did eate the breade of the Lorde, against the Lord. What should I saye more, when Sander confesseth, that Saint Augustine saith, de ciuitat. Dei lib. 21. Cap. 25. Euill men are

not to be sayd to eate the bodie of Christ. But this hee shadoweth with a vaine glosse, that they receiue not the effect of the body of Christ, and citeth other words of August. De verbis Dom. Ser. 22. Non quocunque modo &amp;c. Not howsoeuer a man eate the flesh of Christ, and drinke the bloude of Christ, he abideth in Christ, and Christ in him: but by a certaine kinde of way. As though S. Augustine said (saith he) Euery way, the flesh and bloud of Christ is receiued in ye supper of our Lorde. But howe shamefully he belyeth S. Augustine: you shall heare by his owne words. 
                        Nec isti ergo dicendi sunt manducare corpus Christi, quoniam nec in membris computandi sunt Christi, vt alia taceam, non possunt simul esse &amp; membra Christi &amp; membra meretricis. Denique ipse dicens, Qui manducat carnem meam, &amp; bibit sāguinem meum, in me manet, &amp; ego in eo; ostendit quid sit, non sacramento tenus, sed reuera corpus Christi manducare, &amp; eius sanguinem bibere. Neither are euill men to be said, to eate the body of Christ, because they are not to be accounted in the members of Christ: for to speake nothing of other matters, they cannot be at once, the members of Christ, and the members of an harlot. Finally, he himselfe saying, (He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, abideth in me, and I in him) sheweth what it is, not as farre as a sacrament goeth, but in verie deede, to eate the fleshe of Christ, and to drinke his bloude. This saying of Augustine may serue to expounde, not onely what he himselfe, but whatsoeuer any other ancient Father, seemeth to saye of wicked men, eating the bodie of Christ: namely, that they doe it, Sacramento tenus, but not reuera, they eate the bodie of Christ, as it may bee eaten in an outwarde sacrament, but not in deede.
                  The sixte witnesse is Gregorie, in prim. reg. libr. 2. C. 1. Salutis, &amp;c. They receiue not the fruite of saluation in eating of the healthfull sacrifice. Of these words, Sander can gather nothing, but that hee addeth of his owne, that the healthfull sacrifice, is nothing but the naturall bodie of Christ, which Gregorie neither saith, nor meaneth: but the sacrament which is healthfull to them which receiue it faithfully.

                         compareth (saith Sander) that man to Iudas, who with his sinfull members, presumeth to violate illud inestimabile &amp; inuiolabile domini corpus, that inestimable, and inuiolable bodie of our Lorde. Howe coulde hee violate it with his members, if no part of his bodie touched it? I answere, by violating the sacrament thereof, which they receiue vnfaithfullie, and contemptuously. Howe can hee treade vnder his feete the sonne of God, and esteeme the bloude, in which he was sanctified, cōmon. &amp;c. which neuer came neere the one nor the other, with his bodie? Heb. 10.
                  Let the reader iudge, whether the iudgement of the Fathers, doeth fauour Sander, more then the Apologie. If any man will see more of this controuersie, he may resort to mine answere vnto Heskins. lib. 3. from the 46. Chapter, to the 56.
               
               
                  CAP. IIII.
                  
                     What is the true deliuerance of Christes bodie Sander. and bloude.
                  
                  The Apologie saieth, that in the supper, there is truely Fulke. deliuered the bodie and bloude of Christ, the fleshe of the sonne of God, quickening our soules, the foode of immortalitie, grace, trueth, life. This doctrine, Sander confesseth to bee sounde and Catholike, but out of it, he will prooue the Popish reall presence, and that by two arguments.
                  The first reason is: Christ deliuered but one thing at each time, when he said, This, and This: The Apologie confesseth, that hee deliuered his bodie and bloude: ergo hee deliuered neither breade nor wine, but in appearance, and his bodie and bloude onely in deede. I

denie the Maior, for vnto the faithfull (of whom the Apologie speaketh) he deliuered two thinges, of diuerse natures in one sacrament, or one thing consisting of two diuerse natures, the bread and wine corporally, his bodie and bloud spiritually, as Irenaeus saith. Neither is there such force in this, and this, but that one thing of diuerse natures, or two things in one mysterie, may be signified thereby. When God said: This is the passeouer, it were a madde conclusion to say, it were no Lambe, or, This is the newe Testament, therefore it is not his bloude: because, This can bee but one thing: Yet 'Sander clappeth handes to his owne argument. O masters, trueth is straunge, and by the aduersaries owne weapon, getteth the victorie.
                  
                  His second reason is, When the bodie of Christ is truelie deliuered, it is deliuered according to the truth of his owne nature. The nature of a bodie, is to be deliuered after a bodily maner: therfore the bodie of Christ is deliuered bodily. The Maior is false, for the bodie of Christ may be truely deliuered, when it is deliuered after a spiritual, and diuine maner. For in the saying of ye Apologie, truely is contrarie to falsly, &amp; not to spiritually. And all the Papists confesse, that the body of Christ may be, &amp; must be eaten spiritually. Which of them dare say, the bodie of Christ is eaten falsely, when it is eaten spiritually, or not eaten, when it is eaten spiritually, euen without the sacrament? Againe, if Sander like this Maior, I will thus inferre vpon it: When the bodie of Christ is truely deliuered, it is deliuered according to the trueth of his owne nature: But the nature of a bodie is to occupie but one place at once, and that to fill with his owne quantitie, &amp;c. Therefore the bodie of Christ is so deliuered, as it occupieth but one place, reteyneth quantitie, and all other things required in ye nature of a true bodie. Finally, whereas Sander in the determination of ye Apologie, misseth quickening of our bodies, but that he is disposed to play Momus, hee might haue founde that he misseth in the foode of immortalitie, which toucheth our bodies as wel as our soules, and more properly.
               
               
                  
                  CAP. V.
                  
                     What it is which nourisheth vs in the supper of Christ. Sander.
                     
                  
                  The Apologie saith: that by the partaking of the body Fulke. and bloude of Christ, we are nourished to immortalitie. Hereupon Sander inferreth, that nourishmēr is meat really present ergo the bodie and bloud of Christ is really present. This shalbe graunted, that the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, is really present with them, whom it norisheth, vnderstanding really, for truly and indeede, and vnfainedly. But Christ (saith Sander) gaue with his handes that which nourisheth. In proper forme of speech, this is false: for he had not his natural bodie, and bloud in his hands, but a sacrament thereof, which was a seale, and certaine perswasion vnto the faithfull, of the performance of his promise, which was the communicating of his body and bloude, which was performed after an heauenly, and spirituall manner.
               
               
                  CAP. VI.
                  
                     The vnion, which is made by eating Christes reall flesh, must Sander. needes be a naturall vnion, before it be a mysticall.
                  
                  For this naturall vnion, he bringeth no proofe, but Fulke. promiseth the proofe in other places following: &amp; therfore, vnto those places I deferre the answere. In the meane time, it is a monstrous absurditie, that seeing the mysticall vnion with Christ, is of all the elect that euer were, he affirmeth yt it cannot be without a naturall vnion, by eating Christs flesh and bloud, in the sacrament.
               
               
                  CAP. VII.
                  
                     That the Apologie speaking of the Lordes supper, goeth cleane Sander. from the word of God.
                  
                  
                     
The wordes of the Apologie, are these: We doe acknowledge the Eucharist or the Lordes supper, to be a Fulke. sacrament, that is to say, an euident token of the body and bloud of Christ. This is to bring men from the word of God (saith he) to ye traditions of men. For where haue you in all the scripture, that the Lordes supper is a signe or token of the body and bloud of Christ, that is, a sacrament? And because these wordes are not found in the scriptures, from the beginning of the Genesis, vnto ye end of ye Apocalipse; writen in so many letters, he fometh and fretteth like a mad dogg, against the authors of the Apologie, for going from the worde of God, to the authority of men, Augustine and Ambrose, &amp;c. Then the which quarels, nothing can be inuented more foolish, or further from all witt, learning, and honesty. For when we appeale to the authority of the scriptures in all thinges, we neuer meant or saide, that all other wordes should be forsaken, which are not expressed in the bible; but that no doctrine is to be credited, by what terme so euer it be vttered, except the same be grounded vpon the manifest sense and meaning of the holy scripture, either expressed in plaine wordes, or els gathered by necessary consequence. Therefore seing the meaning of the names of sacrament, signe, or token, may necessarily bee proued out of the holy scriptures, and for that cause haue ben taken vp and vsed, by the ancient fathers, in the primitiue Church, wee vse them as freely as they did, and as we vse other names likewise, the meaning of which, is plaine to be found in the scriptures, although the termes them selues be not: as Trinity, persons, consubstantiall, &amp;c. If Sander durst deny the names of sacrament, signe, or token, to be agreable to the scriptures, I would take paines to prooue them: but seing he confesseth, that they are good and lawfull to be vsed of the supper of Christ, it were superfluous la bour to trauell in a needlesse question. Among the names, that are giuen to the Lordes supper, in the scripture: That the cupp is called The new testament in the bloud of Christ; and that of S. Paul the supper is called

spirituall meate and spirituall drinke (which last name Sander heaping vp the rest omitteth) it doth proue the names of sacrament, signe, and token, soe inuincibly, that we are no more afraide to vse them, then any of the other expressed in plaine wordes of the scripture. The name of sacrifice, which he enterlaceth by the way, because it is afterward more at large discussed, I omit to write of, at this time.

                  It had bene meet that a sacrament had bene first defined, Ful
                           〈…〉
                        
                      and then this trifling should not haue arisen, of the word. Sander himselfe vnderstandeth, mysterium in S. Ambrose, for a mystery, or sacrament. And in deed the Greekes call that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which the Latines call Sacramentum. But if euery mystery, shall be a Sacrament, in that sense that baptisme and the Lordes supper are so called, there shall not be onely seuen Sacraments, as he would haue, but more then seuentie. The name therefore of Sacrament or mystery, is somtims generally taken for euery secret thing, that hath an hidden vnderstanding, so is matrimony of S. Paul called a mystery, and of Augustine the Sacrament of matrimonie, and ordination is vsed. De bon. Con. Cap. 24. so is oyle and imposition of hands, cont. Donat. lib. 5. Cap. 20. reckoned among the mysteries and Sacramentes. But that which Sander doth alleage out of Ambrose, is inforced: for speaking of the power which priestes haue to remitt sinnes by repentance, or by baptisme, he saith, Vnum in vtroque mysterium. Sed dices quia in 
                           •
                        auacro operatur mysteriorū gratia, Quid in poenitentia? nonne dei nomen operatur? There is one mystery in both. But thou wilt say, because in baptisme the grace of the mysteries doth worke, What in repentance? doth not the name of God worke in these wordes, although he call them both mysteries? Yet he putteth a manifest difference, for in baptisme he

acknowledgeth the grace of the mysteries to worke, wt yt visible seale: in the other, the name of god onely, wtout a visible seale: which Sander perceiuing, and not being able to answere these places of Augustine and Ambrose which are cited by the authors of ye Apologie, for the number of the Sacramentes flieth to the authority of the late councell of Florence, not regarding what Ambrose or Augustine hath written, who (he saith) had not the charge to reckon vp how many Sacramentes there are, And I say, that the seuen Sacramentes were not named in any session of that councel, but only in a decree of Eugenius the fourth, vpon the sur

                     ised reconciliation of ye Armenians, which is of small credit, ye same Eugenius for his notable wickednes, being long before deposed by the councell of Basil, and an other Pope being chosen in his place.
               
               
                  CAP. IX.
                  
                     That the supper of our Lord is the chiefe Sacrament of all, but Sander. not acknowledged of the Apologie, according to the word of God.
                  
                  Seing the holy scripture preferreth not the one Sacrament Fulk. aboue the other, and they are both a like effectual seales of the mercy of God to the saluation of his elect, there is no cause, why the Apologie shoulde acknoweledge such excellency of the one aboue the other, as Sander would imagine. But it is a matter of greate importance with Sander, that Dionysius calleth it the Sacrament of Sacramentes, whereby it is not onely proued to be the worthier of the two, but also the chiefe of many Sacramentes. The authority of Dionysius, which he voucheth, as though it were without controuersie of antiquitie, hath often bene disproued, to be without the compase of the sixe hundreth yeares, seing neither Eusebius, nor Hierom, nor Germadius, in their seueral times, did euer heare of any such bookes of Dionysius the Ar

                  But where the Apologie confesseth, the Lordes supper to

be a Sacrament, a signe, and an euident token, of the bodie of Christ, Sander saith, it is constrained, to beleeue many vnwriten verities, and will not beleeue that only, which is written in the scripture, of this supper, that it is the body and bloud of Christ.
                  Beholde the vanitie of this fonde quareller, because these truethes are not expressed in so many Latine or English words in the scripture, therefore they be vnwritten verities. The froward man himselfe, in the Chapter last before confessed, that mysterium in the Greeke, was the same, that is called Sacramentum in Latine. If therefore the Lordes supper, be called in Greeke mysterium, we may find it in the scripture to be called a Sacrament. For where S. Paul saith: let a man thus esteeme vs, as the ministers of Christ, and as the dispensers of the mysteries of God: who doubteth but vnder the name of mysteries, the Lordes supper and baptisme is comprehended? although the name of mystery, be larger in Greke, then we vse the name of Sacrament in Englishe: yet in spight of the diuell, the name of mysterie and Sacrament, is truly verified out of the scripture of the Lordes supper and baptisme. Likewise the name of signe, being giuen by the holy ghost, vsually, to other Sacramentes, by analogie, must likewise apperteine to this Sacramēt. Ge. 17. Circumcision is called the signe of the couenant, betweene God and the people. Likwise Exo. 12. the bloud of the Paschal Lambe, is called a signe, and S. Paul Ro. 4. calleth the signe of circumcision, a seale of iustification.
                  Last of all, hauing found in the scriptures, the Lords supper to be a Sacrament, signe, or seale; the argument of relatiues, leadeth vs by ye hand, to cal it an euident signe, or token of ye body &amp; bloud of Christ, giuen for vs: for that is ye thing signified, which is proued by these words, This is my body, which is giuen for you, &amp;c. Euen as the Lambe is called the passeouer, which was the Sacrament, signe, or euident token of the Passingouer, and not the Passeouer it self. But Sander vrgeth vs to answer,

whether the signe of the body, and the body it self may stande together or no? I answere him plainly, except he destroye the nature of things opposite, the signe and the thing signified, cannot stande together at one time, and in one respect: as it is vnpossible, that Abraham can be the father of Isaac, and the sonne of Isaac also. But in diuerse respectes, they may stande together, as Abraham is the father of Isaac, and the sonne of Therah. So the bread and wine cannot be both the signe of Christes naturall bodie and bloud giuen for vs, and the verie same naturall bodie it selfe. But as it is a diuine mysterie, and heauenly seale, it is truely called that, whereof it maketh assurance, namely, the bodye and bloud of Christe, euen as the cuppe is called the newe testament, whereof it is a seale and assurance, and as baptisme is called regeneration, beeing a seale and assurance therof vnto the children of God.
               
               
                  CHAP. X.
                  
                     That the supper of our Lorde, is both the signe of Christes bodie, Sander. and also his true bodie, euen as it is a sacrament.
                  
                  He requireth diligent eare, as though he had founde out a great argument for his cause, when in deede, it ouerthroweth Fulk. himselfe altogether. For he will shewe, that such a signe as belongeth to Christes institution, must needes haue the same trueth present, whereof it is the sacrament. Which being graunted, it prooueth no more the trueth present in the one sacrament, then in ye other, seeing they belong both to the institution of Christ. But God and Christ (sayth he) cannot institute a false signe or token. I say so also: and withall I say, that seeing God instituted all the Sacramentes of the olde Testament, which were signes and tokens of Christ, Christ was truely present in them, euen as truely as in our Sacramentes: and therefore Saint Paul teacheth, that Our fathers did drinke of the same spirituall

drinke, that wee doe; for they dranke of the spirituall rocke, which rocke was Christ. If Sander coulde content himselfe with such trueth and presence of Christ, as he doeth exhibit in baptisme, and did exhibit in all the Sacraments of the olde testament, which were of his institution, we might soone be agreed. But in the meane time, you see him ouerthrowen in his owne argument. Other matters, not incident to the present controuersie, I omitt, as that the holy ghost in baptisme, at the same instant doeth wash the soule from sinne, as though the effect of baptisme extended no farther, then to the time of washing with water. Likewise, that the outward pronouncing of the wordes ouer the breade and wine, is the Sacrament. Whereby it followeth, that when the sound of the wordes is once past, it is no longer a Sacrament, and consequently, the Papistes must not call that which they worship, the Sacrament of the altar. &amp;c.
               
               
                  CAP. XI.
                  
                     What signe must chiefely be respected in the Sacrament of Sander. Christes supper, and what a Sacrament is.
                  
                  There be (if we beleeue Sander) foure kinde of signes Fulk. in the Sacrament of the altar. The first be tokens making &amp; consecrating the Eucharist, which are the words of cōsecratiō: the second, be signes of it made, which are the accidents of bread &amp; wine. The third, a signification of the Church. And the fourth eating, is a signe of a meruailous banket in the life to come. Of these foure, ye first must be chiefly respected, which is an outward tokē of an inward trueth: the outward token, is called the Sacrament: the inward trueth is called the thing of the sacrament, wherupon the diffinition of a sacrament alleaged by Gratian out of S. Augustine, is this: A Sacrament is the visible forme of inuisible grace. Out of this diffinition, which imployeth two partes of a Sacrament, he wil proue the trueth of the reall presence: for if the bodie be not present (saith he) the words make a false tokē.

I denie the consequence, for the wordes make a true token, and yet the body is not present, after his grosse imagination of bodily manner of presence. His exemplification of the order of priesthood, giuen to the Apostles by these words, Hoc facite, doe and make this, is to make a proofe of one controuersie by another. For we denie the power of making, which he pretendeth there to be giuen, affirming, that it is a commandement to continue that sacrament of his institution, and shewing the vse thereof.
                  His second argument is, that Christ spake not figuratiuely, because a figuratiue speach can signifie no certeine thing, vntil it be plainly vnderstanded. This I denie: for a figuratiue speache may signifie one certeine thing, which the speaker meaneth, although the hearer vnderstand it not at all. Howbeit that which Christ did here speake figuratiuely, was easily vnderstood of all his hearers, which were well accustomed to such kinde of speaches. But Sander replyeth, that the Apostles were simple men &amp; Idiots, and vnderstood not the scriptures: therefore they could not vnderstand how ye signe might be called by the name of the thing. I answere, although they were simple vnlearned men in deede, and such as vnderstood not the scriptures, in such full measure as was necessarie for them to discharge so great an office, as was laid vpon them: yet Sander doth them too much wrong, to make them, or any godly person of yt time, so ignorant in the scriptures, that they vnderstoode not the nature of a Sacrament, considering they were circumcised, &amp; did celebrate the Passeouer euery yere, the verie name wherof must needes teach them, howe the signe may be called by the thing signified. And therfore it is out of measure ridiculous &amp; foolish, that Sander prateth of the true &amp; first meaning of the wordes of Christ. For what will the vaine iangler make to be the true and first meaning of these wordes of Christ, This cupp is the newe Testament? What verifying of contradictories, what diuers soundings? what true tokens, what things present? O great diuinitie of Popish doctors.
                  
                     
But the Apologie is confuted by his owne saying, when he calleth the Eucharist an euident token of the bodie and bloud: if it be euident (saith he,) it is quickly vnderstood. Call women and children, and aske them what token the wordes of Christ make. Nay, rather call Turkes &amp; Sarazens, and aske the question, if it must be euident to them vnto whome the mysterie is not reuealed. The token is euident to them that are instructed, not to such as neuer heard of it, as belike, where Sander hath to do, women and children are. But God be thanked, women and children instructed in the Church of Christ, can tell him howe euident a token it is, of their spirituall feeding, on the bodie and bloud of Christ.
                  But that wordes must be taken as they commonly sound, he will proue by the institution of the sacrament of Penance, as he termeth it, Whose sinnes you forgiue, they are forgiuen, &amp;c. where, as much is giuen, as is signified by the wordes. If this be true, all cases reserued, both episcopall and Papall, are in case to bee forgiuen, by euery priest of the lowest degree. But here the Apologie, which denyeth the Sacrament of Penance, is charged to haue falsified the wordes of Christ, saying, they are meant, whose sinnes you declare to be forgiuen. If the Apologie doe not truely expound the wordes of Christe, yet doeth it not falsifie them, except Sander will saye, that euerie wrong exposition is a falsification. Howe Christes wordes are to be taken, as Sander will not dispute in this place, so neither will I stande here to discusse. But this is a bolde determination of him, that many wordes may signifie vnproperly in other places, but the principall wordes of a Sacrament, cannot be vnproper. For the nature of the thing, doeth limit the interpretation of the wordes. If this doctorall determination be true, then these are proper speaches, The rocke is Christ, the Lambe is the Passeouer: the cuppe is the newe Testament, baptisme is the lauer of regeneration.
                  And S. Augustines rule, De doct, Christ, lib. 3. Ca. 16. must giue place to D. Sanders decree: Si autem flagi
                           •
                        iis, &amp;c.
                     
If the words of scripture seeme to cōmaunde any wicked nor vngodly acte, or to forbid any profit or well doing, it is a figure: Except ye shall eate (saith he) the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shal haue no life in you, it seemeth to commande a wicked or heinous act. Therfore it is a figure, commanding vs to communicate with the Lordes passion, and profitable to kepe in remembrance, that his flesh was crucified and wounded for vs. Againe, Locut. de Gen. lib. 1. fol. 72. Tres fundi tres dies sunt, nō dixit tres dies significāt. Et multū haec locutio notanda est, vbi aliqua significantia earum rerum quas significant nomine appellantur. Inde est quod ait Apostolus, Petra autem erat Christus, non ait Petra significabat Christum. Three basketes are three daies, he said not, they signifie three daies. And this kind of speech is much to be marked where any signifying thinges, are called by the names of those thinges which they doe signifie. Hereof it is, that the Apostle saieth, And the rocke was Christ, hee saith not, the Rocke did signifie Christ.
                  Finally, where Sander saieth, it is against the nature of a Sacrament, not to signifie plainly, I agree with him, affirming that the bread and wine, which is eaten and dronken, doe plainly signifie, that we are fed spiritually, with the very body and bloud of Christ, vnto the full assurance of our perseuerance, &amp; continuance in the fauour of God, euen vntill we be put in possession of eternall life, and the wordes in this Sacrament, be as plaine as in the other, but the diuell to aduance the kingdome of Antichrist, hath deuised a monstrous interpretation of them, to make a most abhominable Idoll of desolation of the most holy and comfortable sacrament of Christes death and passion.

Sander, to dispute for his life, would take the conclusion Fulk. thus: it is a signe of his body, therfore it is his bodie in deed. So that Sander to dispute for his life, would ouerthrow the nature of opposites, which cannot stande both together at one time, and in one respect. But as though Logike were contrarie to the word of God, hee will haue the argument tryed by the word of God. And first he reiecteth the Sacramentes instituted before the incarnation of Christ, which he saith, were signes in part emptie and voide of the trueth, which they signified, because trueth is made by Iesus Christ. As though Iesus Christ concerning the trueth of doctrine, and the grace of saluation, were not yesterday and to day the same, &amp; for euermore, the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the worlde, Hebr. 13. Apocalipse. 13. Secondly, hee bringeth examples of the Angell speaking to Marie of Christe, speaking to the leprous man, to him that had the palsie, to the disciples of Iohn baptist, to the dumme man; to proue, that when at the doing of any thing, an outward signe of an inwarde grace is rehearsed, that which the signe soundeth, the grace worketh.
                  
                  When Sander shal dispute for his life, he must chuse him an easye aduersary, for els he will soone loose his life, for lacke of good argumentes, if he escape hanging, drawing, and quartering for treason. Except he thinke there be any children among vs, brought vp in their Catechisme, that bee so ignorant, to thinke the wordes of Christ intending to worke a particular miracle, be signes &amp; Sacraments, in the same nature, that bread &amp; wine is, being apointed by him, to be an ordinary pledg &amp; assurance of his grace, vnto his whole church. Againe, we deny, that the wordes of Christ are the Sacrament, but wee say with Augustine: Accedat verbum ad elementum: Let the worde come to the element, and then it is made a Sacrament. Last of all, concerning the trueth of Christes wordes: This is my bodie: This cuppe is the Newe testament, &amp;c. wee nothing doubt, but that grace in Gods elect, worketh that which the wordes soundeth, according to the true meaning of them.
                  
                     
But if Sander could haue made his matter good, hee should haue reasoned of the water of baptism, which is a signe of regeneration, and if he could proue, that the water in baptisme is not water, but regeneration in deede, because it is a token of regeneration, he should haue reasoned somewhat like, for his life. But that which he saith of doing or making, he would not haue it wrested to the meere doctrine of Christ, which he spake doing or making nothing: for therein he vsed parables, but Christ (saith he) did, rather then taught in his supper; and therefore, his wordes must be vnderstood euen as they sound. If this rule be true, Christ dranke and gaue wine at his supper, which is the fruite of the vine, according to the sounde of the wordes, and therefore no transubstantiation in the cuppe. But where he saith, that Christ did, rather then taught at his supper, he would haue vs thinke, belike, that Christ did celebrate his supper, like the Popish Masse, in which is much adoe, &amp; no teaching at all. But beside that, all the three Euangelists, do set forth vnto vs, the summe of his doctrine. S. Iohn doeth in foure Chapters, from the 13. to the 18. describe at large, that he was occupied in teaching rather then doing. You haue heard how Sander would dispute for his life.
               
               
                  CAP. XIII.
                  
                     The wordes of Christes supper, are not figuratiue; nor his token, Sander, a common kinde of tokens.
                  
                  The first part of this title, that the wordes of Christes supper, arenot figuratiue, hee prooueth not by any one Fulke word, &amp; as for ye other part, yt Christes token is not a cō
                     mon kind of tokē, which he proueth somwhat at large, he needed not to haue proued at al. For it is confessed of vs, that the sacrament is a more excellent token, then can be ordeined by any man. And where he saith, that none of ye fathers teacheth, yt these words: This is my body, &amp;c. be words figuratiue, it shal suffice, to oppose Augustine, who in plaine termes saith these words: Except ye eat ye
                     
flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c. are a figuratiue speach. Which wordes notwithstanding, among the Papistes, haue the same sense, that these wordes: This is my bo
                     De Doct. Chri. Lib. 3. Cap. 16. the wordes are cited Cap. 11. And what other thing doth Augustine meane, when he sayeth, 
                        Sicut ergo secundum quendam modum sacramentum corporis Christi corpus Christi est, sacramentum sanguinis Christi, sanguis Christi est, ita sacramentum fideifides est. Therefore as after a certaine maner, the sacrament of the body of Christ, is the body of Christ, the sacrament of the bloud of Christe, is the bloud of Christe, so the sacrament of faith (meaning baptisme) is faith. 
                           Epist. 23. Bonisacio.
                        
                      Is it not manifest, that he meaneth the one is a figuratiue speech, as well as the other? Fie vpon this impudent boasting of the Papistes, which care not what lyes they make, so they giue not place to the trueth. As for the sayings of Cyprian, Chrysostome, Basil, &amp;c. or any of the auncient Catholike fathers, concerning the wonderfull manner of the presence of Christ in the sacrament, doe all proue a spirituall and diuine manner of eating and drinking the bodie of Christ, as in their proper places shalbe seuerally declared.
               
               
                  CAP. XIIII.
                  
                     That the supper of our Lorde is no sacrament at all, if these Sander. wordes of Christ (This is my bodie, and this is my bloude) be figuratiue.
                  
                  Two leaues and an halfe of this Chapiter are spent, Fulke. to shewe the difference betweene figures of Rhetorike and sacramentall figures, and that wordes must be ioyned to the elements to make sacramentes: all which is needeles, for it is commonly knowne, and confessed on both parts: sauing that he would make ignorant Papistes beleeue, that Oecolampadius, Caluine or Peter Martyr, whē they read in Tertulliā, &amp; in Augustine, these words of Christ, This is my body, to be so expounded, yt is to say a figure or signe of my body, they shoulde vnderstande a

figure of Rhetorike as Metonymia, or Synecdoche, and not a sacramentall token. No, master Sander, they were not so young Grammarians, or Rhetoricians, as you woulde beare fooles in hand, but they could vnderstand the difference of a rhetoricall, and a sacramentall figure, although they coulde tell that a rhetoricall figure is vsed, when a sacramentall token is spoken off, as in so manie examples of the scripture, they haue shewed. But nowe let vs see, what maine argument you haue, to prooue that the supper is no sacrament, if the wordes (This is my body, &amp;c.) be figuratiue. The words, saie you, doe not signifie a figure of his bodie, therfore either they worke his bodie, or they make nothing at al. I answere wt Tertull. &amp; August. The words do signifie a figure of his body. For so do they expound ye words. This is my body, yt is to say, a figure or signe of my body, which their expositiō, were false, except those wordes This is my body, doe signifie a figure or signe of his bodie. Therefore Master Sander, you may teach boies, that bodie signifieth a substance and not a figure. Tertullian and Augustine will not not be so aunswered at your handes. They tell you that the interpretation of Christes wordes is such, as proueth his speach to be figuratiue, in spight of your heart. And that euery boye, that readeth this chapter, may laugh at your arrogant impudence, I set downe once againe these words of Christ: This cuppe is the newe Testament in my bloud, which if they be not confessed of you, to bee figuratiue, you will not confesse that fire is hote, nor water moyst: If they be figuratiue, what Sacrament will be made with them? Where you tell vs, that the bodie of Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine, is a figure of the same bodie walking on earth, suffering on the crosse, or sitting in heauen, you doe as much, as if you woulde teach vs, that Abraham sitting close in his tent, so that no man coulde see him, was father of the same Abraham him selfe, as he was the sonne Therah, &amp; came with him out of Vr of the Chaldees, and as hee begate Isaac in the lande of Canaan, and as hee is nowe at rest with God in heauen. When you can perswade vs, I saye,

that one man can be father and sonne of himselfe, then wil we beleeue you, that a figure, and the thing figured, be all one.
               
               
                  CAP. XV.
                  
                     The reall presēce of Christs bodie is that, which setteth his death Sander. and life before vs.
                  
                  
                     The eating of common breade (saith Sander in answere to Fulke. the Apologie) and drinking of common wine, is but a homely manner of setting the death, and resurrection, and life of Christ before our eyes. But if the breade and wine be turned into the same bodie and bloude of Christ, which dyed, rose againe, and wrought all the myracles in the worlde: then is the death, resurrection, and conuersation of Christ, in deede set before the eyes of our faith. Is not this an absolute answere, to tell vs of the eating and drinking of common breade and wine, when the Apologie speaketh of the Eucharistie, which as Iustinus saith, wee haue learned to bee common breade and wine, but the bodie and bloude of Christ, that was incarnated for vs. Confessing thus much, what neede hath our faith of transubstantiation of breade and wine, into his bodie and bloude, more then of water into the holy ghost in baptisme? Tush (saith Sander) all other wayes of setting the death, resurrection and conuersation of Christ before our eyes, without the reall presence, is painting and shadowing in comparing of this liuely representation. If this be true preaching of the death of Christ, by which he is euen crucified among vs, as S. Paul saith, Gal. 3. is painting and shadowing: the ministration of baptisme, by which we are ingaffed into the death, buriall, and resurrection of Christ, Rom. 6. is but painting and shadowing with Sander, and no liuely representation. But what affinitie (saith he) hath breade and wine, with the death and resurrection of Christ? I will aske him like wise what affinitie hath water with the death, buriall, and resurrection of Christ? which is not nakedly represented, but so as we are ingraffed into them by baptisme. Rom. 6.
                  
                     
By this prophane question you may see what faith he meaneth, when he speaketh of setting the death and life of Christ before our eyes, namely an hystoricall faith, which because it is common to true Christians, with diuels, is not the faith, that we come to feede vpon in these diuine mysteries. But such a faith as applyeth to our owne comfort, the effecte and fruite of the death, resurrection and conuersation of Christ, with the which, the eating and drinking of bread and wine hath as great affinitie, as things corporal can haue with thinges spiritual, teaching that the most necessarie and onely sufficient nourishment of our soules, is receiued by faith, euen as the outward signes therof are taken with the bodie Yet Chrysostome saieth Hom. 83. in Math. Ipsum igitur vides, ipsum tangis, ipsum comedis. Thou seest himselfe, thou touchest himself, thou eatest himself. See (saith Sander) whether the Apologie do more truely teach, yt the signe or token wtout the real presence, or ye body it selfe present, doth set forth the death and life of Christ. Then heare Chrysostome in the same homely, speaking of the Eucharistye.

But seeing the reall presence whereof he speaketh, by his owne iudgement and confession cannot stand without transubstantiatiō, if transubstantiatiō be not yt real presence which he holdeth is not. And that there was no transubstantiation in the supper of Christ, Chrysostome telleth vs plainly, 
                        Quando hoc mysteriū tradidit, vinum tradidit, when he delyuered this mysterie or sacrament, he deliuered wine. And this saith Chrysostome against thē that vsed to celebrate wt water. But to helpe out transu

                         downe from heauen, but because the breade and wine is chaunged into the bodie and bloude of Christ. Damascene helpeth not so much, with the worde of chaunging, as he hindreth you with denying the comming down of the bodie of Christ except you say, it is euerie where. And therefore aduise your self, what presence and maner of change Damascene speaketh of, when the bodie of Christ commeth not out of heauen into the priestes hands. But Cyrillus (saith he) teacheth, That we touch the bodie of Christ when wee come to the holy communion, euen as Saint Thomas touched the side of Christ, when he cryed out, My Lorde and my God. So wee touch that flesh, when we touch the forme of breade, as saint Thomas did touch the Godhead, when hee touched the fleshe of Christ. For in each place, we touch not either the Godhead, or the fleshe visiblie. These are high poyntes of Metaphysike, Master Sander, to touch the godhead, which is insensible, and to touch visiblie, or inuisiblie, except you meane by touching not visibly, to touch that which wee see not as we may handle a thing in the darke, which wee see not. But howsoeuer you would cloake ye matter by leauing out ye wordes of Cyril, hee saith, that Christ in the sacrament appeareth visiblie. Where is then your distinction of visible and inuisible presence? nay where is your carnall presence become, which you grounde vppon touching, when he is none otherwise present to be touched, then he is present to be seene, and so saieth Chrysostome also in the place by you cited, Thou seest himselfe, thou touchest himselfe, thou

                            stabiles ab omni longè ambiguitate inueniamur. Worthelie therefore the holy congregations are made in the Churches on the eight day, and ye doores being shut after an highe manner, Christ appeareth to vs all, both visiblie, and inuisiblie. Inuisiblie truely as God: but visibly in his bodie. For he giueth vs his flesh to bee touched, that we might beleeue assuredly, that hee hath truely raised vp his temple. For that the communion of the mysticall blessing is a certaine confession of the resurrection of Christ, it is prooued by his owne words For he distributed the bread after it was broken, saying: This is my bodie, which shalbe deliuered for you, for the remission of sinnes, Doe this for the remembrance of me. Therefore the participation of the mysterie, is a certaine true confession and commemoration that for our sakes, and for vs, our Lord both hath dyed and is reuiued, and through that, filleth vs with diuine blessings. Let vs therefore flee infidelitie, after the touching of Christ, and let vs bee found stedfast and strong, being farre from al doubtfulnesse. You see both Chrysostome and Cyrill agree that Christ is visiblie present in the sacrament, as they agree that he is touched. And as Chrysostome affirmed, that Christ gaue wine, so Cyrill affirmeth that he distributed breade. By both which confessions, it appeareth, that breade and wine, and not the shapes of breade and wine, are giuen in the sacrament, and that the bodie and bloud of Christ is visiblie present, which cannot be vndestoode of the Popish presence, and therfore of necessitie must be ment of a spirituall manner of presence, which is seene onely by faith.

                     Our thankesgiuing and remembrance of Christes death, is alsogether Sander. by the reall presence of his body.
                  
                  I haue often shewed, what maner of presence we allowe, Fulke. agreable to the scriptures, and the iudgement of the ancient fathers. But that will not satisfie Sander, except he haue a making of Christs body, which making, he saith, is the thankesgiuing for his death. Whereupon it followeth, that seeing, making by his iudgement, pertaineth onely to the priestes, that thanksgiuing also pertaineth only to the Priestes. But Chrysostome (whom hee citeth) maketh thanksgiuing common to all the faithfull, Ipso genere sacrificii, &amp;c. By the verie kinde of sacrifice, inuiting vs to thankesgiuing for his benefites. And by the way, Chrysostome teacheth, what kinde of sacrifice the celebration of the communion is accounted of him: Namely, a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, and not of reconciliation. And therefore he writeth in the same

Therefore euen those reuerend and healthfull mysteries, which truly we celebrate in euerie congregation of the Church, are called Eucharistia, that is a thankesgiuing. For they are a calling to minde of many benefites, and shew vnto vs the verie heade of the loue of God towarde vs, and make vs to yeelde dewe thankes to God alwayes. But to a Christian, saith Chrysostome, Hee himselfe is set before thee dayly, lest thou shoulde be vnmindefull. Beholde (saith Sander) not by a feeble token doubtfully, but by his owne presence he is called to minde. Note heere that he calleth it a feeble token, where Christ is bodilie absent, by which it shoulde followe, that baptisme is but a feeble token, where Christ is not bodily present.

But Christ is present in both his sacramentes, although he bee absent bodily: and so meaneth Chrysostome that he is present spiritually. For in the same Hom. 51. in Mat. he saith, 
                        Ipsum enim si volumus, non vestis solùm sed corpus ipsius nobis propositum est, non vt tangamus solummodò, sed vt comedamus &amp; saturemur. For not onely his garment, but his bodie is set before vs, not onely that wee may touch him, if wee will, but also that wee may eate him and be satisfied. Marke in these words, after what manner the bodie of Christe is set before vs, to be touched and eaten: verilie euen as his garment is set before vs to bee touched. But no man will saye, that the garment of Christe is otherwise set before vs, then after a spirituall manner: no more verily is the bodie of Christ.
               
               
                  CAP. XVII.
                  
                     The true resurrection of our bodies, commeth by eating Sander. that bodie of Christe, whiche is both true, and is true in vs.
                  
                  This is confessed by the Apologie, that the resurrection Fulke. of our bodies to glorie, commeth by the eating and drinking of the bodie and bloude of Christe: but that this eating and drinking, may be without the Sacrament, it is manifest by this, that manie shall bee partakers of the glorious resurrection, which did neuer eate this Sacrament. But nowe let vs see, what vaine reasons Sander bringeth, to prooue that the resurrection of our bodies commeth by eating of Christ in the Sacrament onely. First Christ prepared a supper, and set it forth vpon his table, but the breade and wine was prepared by the baker and the vintener: therefore Christs preparing was to make of earthly bread the bread of euerlasting life, which was his body that he deliuered, and they receiued.
                  All this we confesse. Yea saith Sander, but he delyuered it with his owne handes, or else doubtlesse they

did not eate his bodie. But where is the necessitie of this consequence? For hee saide in respect onely of that which hee delyuered, Take and eate. Yea syr, but howe prooue you, that hee deliuered onely with his handes, that hee deliuered, and whereof hee saide, take and eate? Is there nothing delyuered in baptisme, but the water which is in the hande of the minister or in the fonte? The onely proofe hee bringeth, is Chrysostome, Hom. 82. in Math. where there is no such wordes at all to bee founde, yet thus he citeth them: Cogita quid manu capias, Bethinke thy selfe what thou takes
                           •
                         in thy hande, and keepe it from all couetousnesse and violent robberie: consider againe, that thou tak
                           •
                        st it not onely in thy hande, but also puttest it to thy mouth, and after thy hande and tongue, thy heart receiueth that dreadefull mysterie. Here (saieth Sander) the hande and tongue, receiue the same bodie, that the heart doeth. And yet Chrysostome (if euer hee haue such a context) nameth not the bodie, but the mysteries. It is one thing to receiue the mysteries, another thing to receiue the bodie in such manner as the Papistes doe teach. And Chrysostome vsing the same wordes, but not in such context, ad Pop. Antiochen. Hom. 21. hath also linguam sanguine tali purpuratam, &amp; factam aureum gladium, the tongue dyed purple with such bloude, and made a golden sworde. Likewise the eyes, by whiche thou hast seene the secretes and dreadfull mysteries: which sayings doe shewe, that hee spake not of a bodily presence, or receiuing, but of a spirituall receipt and faith, by which wee see Christe present, and acknowledge our tongue to bee dyed purple with his bloude, and to be made a golden sworde, which is not done corporally, but spiritually.
                  The last argument is, that the Lordes supper hath beene of olde time called the Sacrament of the Altar, by which (saieth hee) wee are informed, that the sacrifice is made vpon a visible Altar, or table, and so S. Augustines mother confessed, yt from ye altar was dispensed, yt holy sacrifice, wherby ye hādwriting yt was contrarie

to vs, hath bene put out. And we doe likewise confesse, that from the holy Altar or table is dispensed in the holy communion, the sacrifice of Christs death and passion, by which onely, that handwriting was put out, and nayled on the crosse, except you thinke S. Augustines mother was of another opinion, then S. Paul. Col. 2. v. 14. We cōfesse, yt regeneration by the spirit of God is dispensed out of the holy fonte of Baptisme, and yet it followeth not, that the holy ghost is conteined in the fonte, or water: no more doth the dispensation of the sacrifice of Christes death from the table, prooue that Christs bodie lyeth vpon the table. The argument of the resurrection of our bodies, which Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Cyril doe gather of receiuing of the Sacrament, is from the signe to the thing signified: and therefore Tertullian maketh ye same argument, from the washing of baptisme, and from other ceremonies of annoynting, signing, and laying on of hands,

The flesh is washed with water, anointed with oyle, shadowed with mens handes, signed with mens handes: therefore the flesh is fedde with breade and wine, which Sander maketh such a daungerous matter, yet the same is affirmed both by Irenaeus, Cyrill, and Iustinus Martyr.

And when wee teach, that Christ giueth vs in his supper, an assurance of our spiritual nourishment by him, and coniunction spirituall with him, we teach a worke of Christ in the supper. But you teach not (saith Sander) that any substantiall thing is wrought in the breade and wine. In deede we teach no chaunge of the substance of breade and wine, but that they remaine in their former nature and substance, but we teach a supersubstantiall thing to be wrought by Christs word, which being ioyned to breade and wine, maketh of earthly and bodilie nourishment, heauenly and spiritual foode, to feede both bodie and soule vnto euerlasting life. And this is sufficient to prooue, that something is wrought in the supper of Christ by our doctrine, bable Sander what he will to the contrarie, although no transubstantiation be wrought, except he will saie, that nothing is wrought in baptisme, because there is no transubstantiation taught either by them, or vs in our doctrine of baptisme.

                  Sander woulde beare men in hande that there is great Fulke, fraude hidden in these wordes, when the Apologie

saieth: that wee affirme that Christ doeth truely and presently giue his owne selfe in his Sacraments, in baptisme, that wee may put him on, in his supper▪ that we may eate him by faith and spirite. For by these wordes, His owne selfe, his owne selfe, his owne selfe, so often repeated, they meane no more then the comming of his grace and charitie into our soules, by faith, spirite, and vnderstanding, whollie robbing vs of that fleshe whiche dyed for vs, and of that bloude whiche was shedde for vs. If we did neuer vse the names of giuing his bodie, his flesh, his bloude, wee might perhaps come in suspition of Mani

                     heisme: but when wee vse these names, and the other of Christe, giuing himselfe, and vs eating of Christe, which the Scripture doeth affirme, as well as the other, none but a peeuish wrangler, woulde take exceptions to our termes. Of the two natures in one person Christe, there neede to bee no question, but that Sander, by telling what Scriptures are proper to both the natures, woulde by authoritie of one Saint Germanus, I cannot tell whence hee came (for the Louanistes are greate coyners of antiquities) teach vs that these wordes of Christe, Matth. 28. Behold I am with you to the ende of the worlde, may be meant as well by the nature of manhoode, which wee haue with his godhead in the Sacrament, as by the onely nature of the Godheade: and that in this place of Matth. 26. The poore you shall haue alwayes with you, mee yee shall not haue alwayes. By the worde Mee, hee meaneth not his Godheade, but the nature of his manhoode, as it was when hee spake in a visible forme of a poore man, but not as it is in the Sacrament. What, Master Sander? thinke you to playe bopeepe with the nature of manhoode, in forme visible and not visible? Is not the nature of Christes manhoode, the same whether it bee in forme visible or inuisible? If it bee the same, and the nature of the manhood is simplie denyed to bee present, howe can you make the same nature that is absent to bee present, vnlesse you will saye, this worde Mee signifieth neither his

Godhead, nor the nature of his manhood, nor both together, but the visible forme of a poore man? Fy on these beggerly shiftes, too badde for boyes to vse in their sophismes. S. Augustine is a cleare witnesse against you for vnderstanding of both the textes.

                     Hee spake of the presence of his bodye. For according to his maiestye, according to his prouidence, according to his vnspeakeable and inuisible grace, it is fulfilled which was saide of him: Behold, I am with you alwaies, euen to the ende of the worlde. But according to that fleshe, which the worde tooke vppon him: according to that hee was borne of a virgine, according to that hee was taken of the Iewes, that hee was crucified on the tree, that hee was taken downe from the crosse, that he was wrapped in linen clothes, that he was laide in the sepulchre, that he was manifested in his resurrection, you shal not alwaies haue him with you. Wherefore? Because he was conuersant with his disciples 40. daies, according to the presence of his body, and they bringing him on his way by seeing, not by following, he went vp into heauen, &amp; is not here: For he

is there where he sitteth at the right hand of the father, and he is here, for he departed not in presence of his maiestie. Otherwise according to the presence of his maiestie, we haue Christ alwayes, according to the presence of his flesh, it is rightly said vnto the disciples, but me you shall not alwaies haue. For the Church had him according to the presence of his flesh a fewe dayes, now she holdeth him by faith, she seeth him not with eies. 
                           In Ioan. 12. Tr.

                  But to returne to Sander, it is the flesh and bloud of Christ which worketh our saluation (saith he) and wee saye no lesse, if the materiall cause may be called a working. He that taketh this from the Sacrament, depriueth vs of the meane to come to eternall saluation, saith Sander. This I deny, for he that should take away the San crament, cannot depriue vs of the meane to come by eternall life. Yes (saith Sander) for that redemptiowhich was wrought by his flesh and bloud, is applied to all that bee of a lawfull age, by worthye eating and drinking therof. But where hath he that exception of them that be of lawefull age, or that eate it worthily? Christ speaketh generally and absolutely, of both. And why should we thinke, there is any other meane to apply the redemptiō purchased by the fleshe and bloud of Christ for vs, then was for the fathers, as before Christ came in the flesh? Faith was the onely meane vnto them, and the Sacraments were the seales of their faith: What other meanes need we to atteine to the same saluation? He saith, when the flesh of Christ was crucified, the soul of Christ deliuered the soule of Abraham and all the other fathers out of prison. But where findeth he, that Abraham and the fathers were in prison, vntill that time. We find before that time, that Abrahā was in so happy estate, yt his bosom was a receptacle of comfort for al his faithfull children. Luc. 16.
                  But to end the matter so euill fauouredly begunne, Sander saieth, that Christ to shew that he would be in his supper by the nature of his manhoode, for that cause named not his person, but his flesh, his body, his bloud; and Saint Paul nameth; his

bones. And therefore marke this againe and againe, beleeue thou 
                           •
                        he presence of body, bloud, of flesh and of bones as the word of God speaketh. Marke you Papistes, marke againe, and againe, Sander saith, he named his flesh, body &amp; bloud, because he would be in his supper by nature of his manhood, ergo it is true. S. Paul saith that euery true Christian and member of the Church that was from the beginning of the world, is a member of Christes body and of his flesh, and of his bones, ergo beleue thou the presence of Christs body, flesh and bones in ye Sacrament. Verily we beleeue pledg and assurance of this cōmunication &amp; vnion with Christ, to be giuen vs in the Sacrament; but in such manner as it was giuen to all the faithfull before the incarnation of Christ, who were likewise members of Christes body, of his flesh, and of his bones: but such a monstrous presence, as the Papistes do imagine, as we knowe it to be needles, so we affirme it to be against all such places of the scripture, as teach vs the trueth of Christs humaine nature, to be like vnto vs in all thinges except sinne. Heb. 2.

                     It is a colde supper which the Sacramentaries assigne to Christ, Sander. in comparison of his true supper.
                  
                  The eating of Christ by faith and spirite, which wee Fulke. affirme, Sander confesseth to be no sleight or colde thinge, but to say that no more is done in his supper, that is sleightly and coldely saide. Why so Master Sander? Partly (he saith) because it may be done without the supper. And is it therefore a colde supper? Because a man may eate at dinner the same meate which he eateth at supper, doth it follow that he eateth a cold supper? may not his supper, be as warme as his dinner? Alas this is a cold reason partly, it is a cold thing to call men, who consist of bodies, to a supper of Christes making, and to giue their bodyes none other meate, then corruptible bread and wine, whereas Christ did forbid vs to worke the perishing

meat, at his banket. You might likewise say, it is a cold bath, to call men which consist of bodies to regeneration, and to giue their bodies nothing but cold water, whereas the holy ghoste saith, the washing of the fil thines of the flesh saueth vs not, 1. Pet. 3. or els Sander maketh another cold &amp; wreched reason, we call men to yt supper, wherin Christ being receiued by faith, dwelleth in vs by his spirit, &amp; we are fed vnto the saluation, both of body and soule. Last of all howe can it be called the supper of Christ, which euery man may make at home without cōming to the table of Christ? For euery man may eate bread and drinke wine, at his owne house, with his wife and children, and remember that Christ died for them, neither will Christ leaue his good deuotion vnrewarded, wherein the supper that you assigne to Christ, consisteth and is fulfilled. Beside the shamelesse slander, that our supper is fulfilled in such a priuate presumptuous acte, marke how he alloweth, the sacrilegious arrogance of him, 'that should vsurp (if any were so madde to doe, as he is to imagine) such a ridiculous counterfeting and mocking of Christes institution: hee doth assure him that Christ will not leaue his good deuotion vnrewarded. But this is but a cold assurance. Like as it is but a cold preparation, which is made by transubstantiation, whereby after so greate broiling, rosting, and saucing, to compasse such cookery as Sander taught vs in the first booke Cap. 4. such a presence is wrought, as maketh the body of Christ none otherwise present to a faithfull man, then to an infidel, than to a dog, a cat or a rat. Alas that is a cold presence, &amp; a cold body, yt is wtout efficay of spirit and life, in them which receiue it. But certeinly the flesh and bloud of Christ, is of another nature, where it is receiued by faith, which is able to warme the stomake of a penitent sinner, whose hart was cold, for feare of Gods iustice, and punishment dew for his sinnes. And when Sander hath prated neuer so whotly, and reasoned neuer so coldly, it will be but a cold comfort, that he can minister with his surmised bodily presence, except he borrowe the chafingdish of

faith and spirituall eating to warme it: which though he confesse, that wee acknowledge, yet he affirmeth it maketh but a sleight and a colde supper, whereas by his owne confession, there is no heate in his fantasied presence, without faith and spirituall feeding: and faith and spirituall eating is a good warme recreation, euen without the Sacrament.

                     By eating, we touch the bodie of Christ, as it may be touched vnder Sander. the forme of breade.
                  
                  That is (sayeth Sander) as wee are truely sayd to kisse Fulke. the Kinges knee, when wee kisse his hose, vnder which the knee is conteined. But that is not properly to kisse the Kinges knee, which is to kisse his hose: for kisse, and not kisse, as I take it, be contradictories. But who can deuise an eating of meate in a supper, which shalbee without touching the meate with teeth and mouth? (saith Sander) Christ sayeth, my meate is, to do the will of my father that sent me Iohn. 4.
                  And he promiseth his Apostles, that they shall eate and drinke at his table in his kingdome. Luc. 22. This eating and drinking, is without teeth or mouth. And Saint Augustine speaking of eating the body of Christ, sayeth: Vt quid par as dentes &amp; ventrem? Crede, &amp; manducasti. Why doest thou prepare thy teethe and thy belly? Beleeue, and thou hast eate it. In Ioan. Cap. 6. Tr. 25. Againe, Panis quippe iste interioris hominis quaerit esuriem. For this bread seeketh the hunger of the inner man. Tr. 26.
                  And vpon these wordes: If any man shall eate of it, he shall not die. 
                        Sed qui pertinet ad virtutē sacramenti, non qui pertinet ad visibile sacramentū. Qui manducat intus, non foris, qui manducat in corde, non qui premit dente. But he which perteineth to ye vertu of ye sacramēt, not he which perteineth

to y• visible Sacramēt. He which eateth within, not without; which eateth in his heart, not hee which presseth with his teeth. Likewise, Cyprian

                           ra panem sanctum frangimus &amp; partimur. As often as wee doe these things, we do not whet our teeth to bite, but with syncere faith we breake and diuide that holy breade. Thus you may see, howe we may eate that which wee touche not with teeth and mouth. And whereas Chrysostome and Cyrill, as we heard before, saide that Christ giueth his flesh to be touched, they speake improperly, and meane a touching by the mouth of faith, like as they affirme also, that he giueth himselfe to be seene, which is not but with the eye of faith. And it is strange, that Sander dare not as well say, We see him, as, we may see him, vnder the forme of breade: as that wee touche him vnder the forme of bread: but the matter is, that then he shoulde destroy his doubtie distinction of the bodily presence visible and inuisible. Although Cyrillus, as is shewed before, affirmeth that Christ is visibly present in the sacrament of his body. Touching by beliefe, Sander will not deny at length, although in the beginning, he marueiled how touching could be without the mouth &amp; teeth, but that touching by beliefe, he sayeth, is furthered by touching that visibly, wherein we beleeue ye flesh of Christ to be inuisibly. A sorie furthering, by touching a bare accident of that which is not there, nor is the proper accident of that which is said to be there. But howe much more furtherance is it to our feeding by faith, to eate substantially, that which is Gods seale and assurance of that foode which nourisheth both bodies and soules vnto euerlasting life?
                  It is an olde custome of heretikes (he saith) by assertion of one trueth, to imbarre and stoppe another truth: but so do not we, for we barre not any trueth that is admitted by the Scriptures: but it is a custome of the diuell to be enimie to all trueth, whome the Papistes followe in this their heresie of transubstantiation, denying the breade and wine to be in the Sacrament, whereas

they be in deede, and affirming the naturall body of Christ to be substantially conteined vnder the accidēts of bread and wine, euen in the mouth of wicked men, &amp; of brute beastes, which is both false and blasphemous.

                     The Sacramentaries haue neither vnderstanding, nor saith, Sander. nor spirit, nor deuotion to receiue Christ withall.
                  
                  We haue no vnderstanding (he saith) because we say, This is my body, doth not meane, this is my body. Yes Fulke. sir Sophister, we say the wordes to meane his body, after a certeine manner, as Augustine saith, although not after your grosse manner. And howe do you vnderstande these wordes spoken of the other part of the Sacrament? This cuppe is the newe Testament in my bloud. Will you not say in some sense, it is not the new testament? Secondly, ye haue no faith, that beleeue not the working and effectuall wordes of Christ, which were spoken with blessing. Yes forsooth sir, wee beleeue they wrought and brought to effect, whatsoeuer it pleased him to doe by them. Thirdly, we haue no spirite, in Sanders corporall iudgement, when wee knowe not the wordes of Christ to be spirit and life, as the which make all that they saide in the consecration of his holy mysteries: but we acknowledge his wordes to be spirite &amp; life, because he neuer giueth his flesh, but with effect of his quickening spirite. And that is a grosse spirite, and a deadly life, which imagineth all that to be made in the mysteries which the words soundeth, for then the cuppe should be made bloud, and the newe testament in his bloud. What is, They are spirite and life, sayth Augustine? in Ioan. T. 27. Spiritualiter intelligenda sunt: they are to be vnderstood spiritually, therfore not according to the sounde of wordes, but according to the minde of the speaker.
                  
                     It is colde deuotion (saith Sander) that hearing the body of Christ, by himselfe affirmed to be present, can eate without adoring,
                     
                     and denye godly honour to it. We eate not without adoring (Master Sander) although wee adore not that which we eate bodily, but that which wee eate spiritually, giuing this diuine honour vnto him, that wee put our whole trust &amp; confidence in his redemption, wherof this externall and visible sacrament is a pledge and assurance.

                  The Apologie confesseth that Christ is giuen vs in ye

If Christ be giuen vs (sayeth Sander) in these mysteries, he is present in them: for a gift is not made of a thing absent. Yes, Master Sander, if the Prince at Westminster, giue a manor lying in Yorkeshire by letters patents, the Patentee which receiueth his Patent at Westminster, hath the manor truely giuen vnto him, which is in Yorkeshire. Therefore, a gift by sufficient assurance, may be of a thing absent in nature thereof: and so is Christes body giuen vs in the mysteries, which are the seale of Gods promise, truely giuing Christes body vnto vs, which according to the naturall and corporal manner of presence, is in heauen, and not on the earth. Col. 3. But Sander woulde vnderstande howe wee knowe, that wee are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, except it be by the reall &amp; corporall presence of Christ in the mysteries? Yes forsooth, wee knowe it by the worde of God, which so testifieth, Eph. 5. and by the spirite of Christ which dwelleth in vs, Rom. 8. and last of all, we haue assurance therof by the holy sacrament, as by a seale, confirmation, and pledge of the perfourmance of Gods promises vnto vs.
                  But a coniunction betwixt the flesh of Christ, &amp; the

flesh of men, cannot be made (saith he) by faith, spirite, and vnderstanding. As man and wife cannot become one flesh by consent of mariage, except in deede they come bodily togither. Yes sir, wee holde, that Christ is actually ioyned to the nature of man, by his incarnation, but this coniunction profiteth not all men, but only them to whome he is ioyned, by spirite, faith, &amp; vnderstanding: and so the incarnation of Christ, made all the fathers of the olde testament, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. For otherwise, it is the spirite that quickeneth, the flesh prositeth nothing. What auaileth it the reprobate, that God is become man, ioyned in the same substance of fleshe, bloud and bones, and humane soule? Nothing: because they lacke the spirite of Christ and faith.
                  Last of all, where he saith, that man &amp; wise cannot become one flesh without carnal copulation, it is a beastly opinion. For he that sayde, they shall bee two in one flesh, spake of the holy coniunction of two persons in mariage, according to Gods institution, before carnall copulation, by which, the acte of generation is sanctified, and the bed made to bee vndefiled, not restraining the coniunction to the coupling of their bodies. For the Scripture called Ioseph and Marie, husband and wife, although there were no comming together of their bodies. And howe can the Papistes affirme Matrimonie to be a sacrament, when the coniunction in one flesh, which is ye effect thereof, cannot be wrought by the worde of God, but is left in the choise of the man and the woman? Last of all, where Sander saith, there is no other meanes taught in the Gospell, howe Christ may be present in flesh, or his flesh ioyned to our flesh, but by meanes of transubstantiation, it will fall out, that seeing transubstantiation is not taught in the Gospell, neither was thought vpon sixe hundred yeares in the Church, but the contrarie manifestly proued, that Christ is not present in flesh at all, nor his flesh shoulde be ioyned to our flesh by any meanes. Such trueth is in his assertions.
               
               
                  
                  CAP. XXIIII.
                  
                     The contrarietie of the Apologie is shewed, and that the lifting vp of our heartes to heauen, is no good cause why we should lift Sander. the bodie of Christ from the altar.
                  
                  First he chargeth vs with great forgetfulnesse. Afterwarde Fulke. to make a shewe of contrarietie, he falsifieth most impudently the wordes of the Apologie, which he cited himselfe in the Chapter last before. Christ giueth him selfe present in these mysteries, &amp;c. therefore he is not here, but in heauen, feeding vs from thence. This worde, Present, hee nowe addeth, which because he missed before, he would seeme to proue it by reason. Shall I saye, who euer had to doe with such a forgetfull man, or rather, with so shamelesse an heretike? Although the Apologie neuer denyeth simply the presence of Christ in the mysteries, but alwayes, that manner of presence, which the papists affirme, and is now in controuersie betweene vs.
                  That the exhortation to lift vp mens heartes, is no good argument to proue that Christ is onely in heauen, he vseth much foolish babling, as though that saying onely were brought for an argument, or that saying of it selfe for a sufficient argument, or that saying for any argument. But where the Scripture sayth, that Christ after his ascension, concerning his humanitie, hath left the worlde, Ioan. 16. (which the Apostles vnderstood to be spoken plainly, and without all parable) and that he sitteth in heauen, and not on earth, Col. 3. the Apologie sayth, this is the cause why the people are exhorted to lift vp their heartes: and not as Sander peruerteth it, because the people are exhorted to lift vp their heartes, therefore Christ is not present in his mysteries.
                  But lifting vp of heartes with the olde fathers, was to acknowledge the mysteries vpon the table, to beleeue the sacrifice of the Masse, and not to denye the reall presence of Christ, saith Sander. Doe you not looke for some sound argument, to proue this geare, especially of

him which immediatly before, charged the author of the Apologie, to vse an argument more like a tinker, than a diuine? you shall heare his argument of authority of Chrysostom, Hom. de Eucharistia. Diddest thou not promise the Preist, when he cried, Lift vp your minds and hearts: and saiedst thou not: we lift them vp vnto our Lord? Will you see a wonderfull matter? The table is furnished with the mysteries. The lambe of God is offered for thee, the Priest is hofull for thee, a spirituall fire floweth from the table. Loe here be the mysteries vppon the table, heere is the lambe of God offered which is the sacrifice of the Masse. But I pray you sir, what is the spirituall fire that floweth from the table? O that is a figuratiue speech, you will say, alluding to the burned offering of the old law. Nay, if ye haue figures of rhetorike, then you haue no trueth, you haue but foolish dreames, you haue nothing made by your wordes. Is not this your owne Logike, Master Sander?

                     What be grosse imaginations concerning the supper of Christ. Sander.
                     
                  
                  The wordes of the Apologie are these: Cyrillus saith: that in the receiuing of the mysteries, all grosse imaginations Fulke. must be put away. Sander chargeth the fine penner of ye Apologie, with foule play, in belying Cyrillus, as though he had spoken against the real presence which they beleue, and therefore citeth where Cyrillus speaketh of those grosse imaginations because the place is merueilous euident against him. Would you not think that Sander had great aduantage, that so dare be bolde to raile? you shall heare the wordes of Cyrillus In 11. Anathemat. ad Enoptium, against Nestorius: but whereas shameles Sander cutteth of the one halfe of the sentence, which is merueilous euident against him, I wil set down the whole sentence, euen to the period, and the sentences following also, which giueth some light to the former.

                  Heere Sander choppeth of: but Cyrill proceedeth: And doest thou attempt to handle by humaine cogitations those thinges which are receiued, by onely pure and vncurious or simple faith? For seeing the nature of the Godhead is not eaten, for this cause shall any man say that the holy body of our Lord is a common body? But it is profitable for vs to knowe, that as we saide before, the body of that worde which quickeneth all thinges, is a proper body. And seing it is the body of life, it is of power to quicken. For by this it giueth life vnto our mortall bodies, and doeth make voide the power of death, and in equall manner the holy spirite of Christ doeth quicken vs. For it is the spirite that quickneth, according to the saying of the same our Sauiour.
                  
                  Thus farre Cyrillus, whose words doe plainly shewe that he calleth all those grosse and humane cogitations, by which it is saide, that Christ, is eaten in the Sacrament, as a naturall man, and any otherwise receiued then only by faith. Such are the imaginations of the Papistes, that Christ is eaten carnally, euen without efficacy of his spirite, that he is included vnder the formes of bread and wine, that he is receiued with the mouth, pressed with the teeth, swallowed with the

throte, essentially &amp; naturally turned into the substance of our bodies, or our bodies turned into him, and an hundreth other such grosse cogitations, as the Papistes haue of digestion, corruption of the accidentes, eating of the Sacrament by brute beastes, these be grosse imaginations, of which Cyrillus speaketh, that tende ad 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to the eating of a man, or to any kinde of eating the flesh of Christ, other then by faith only. And therefore Sander might haue spared his paines in noting tenne other grosse imaginations.
                  The first, that wee should not imagine Christ to lie, where he saith, it is his bodie, as though we did imagine any such blasphemy.
                  The second, that wee should not imagine his saying to be darke or obscure, when Cyrillus ad Calosyrium saith, Eo manifestè dicente, sith himselfe saith manifestly. Although wee doe not imagine his wordes to be obscure, yet this is a grosse argument, to prooue that his wordes be not figuratiue, because Cyrill writeth he saith manifestly, that is, it is manifest that he calleth the bread his body, for he saith as manifestly, this cuppe is the newe Testament.
                  The third grosse imagination, that wee should not thinke any other body to be eaten, but the true body of Christ, who in one person is God and man, as Nestorius thought that the body of a man was eaten, but not the proper body of God the worde. We imagine no such matter, but wee denie that true body to be eaten in the Sacrament otherwise then by faith onely, as Cyrillus teacheth vs.
                  The fourth grosse imagination, that wee should eate the body of Christ dead, and passible, whereas it is quicke and of power to quicken vs, as Cyrill saith, Quoniam, &amp;c: Because the flesh of our sauiour ioyned to the word of God, which is life naturally, is made able to giue life, when wee eate it, then wee haue life in vs, being ioyned to that flesh which is made life.
                  
                  
                     
According to this saying of Cyrillus, wee beleue, that we cannot eate that flesh, except wee haue life thereby, but the Papistes grossely imagine, it may be eaten without effect of life. The fift grosse imagination, that we should eate Christes flesh rawe, as the Capernaits: &amp; as grossely do they imagine, which teach, that it is prepared with such cookerie, that all spices, confection, sauces, &amp;c. are conteined in it, as Sander doeth. The sixt grosse imagination, that it shoulde be eaten by peeces, one a shoulder, and another a legg, against which eating Saint Augustine speaketh. And as grosse it is to imagine and meere monstrous, that the naturall bodie should be eaten after a corporall manner, whole of euery men, and in so many places at once. The seuenth grosse imagination is, of the Lutherans, which thinke the flesh of Christ is eaten with bakers breade, whereas Christe woulde not haue in his supper an earthly substance of materiall breade. More grosse is the imagination of the Papistes, which holde, that the glorious bodie of Christ must be eaten with vaine accidents of bread and wine, which Sander calleth the veiles and curteines, to co
                        •
                     er the saide flesh, because our eyes are not able to see that glorious and mysticall kinde of presence. Beware Sander, what you say, lest you proue a Sacramentarie. Was the presence of Christ in the Sacrament, another manner of presence, then that presence which the Apostles behelde with their eyes sitting before them? Yea, it was a glorious and mysticall presence. If you coulde holde you there, wee shoulde soone bee agreed. The eight, is to confesse the reall presence, and to denye adoration, let them answere, that defende such presence. The ninth, howe grosse is it to denye it to be a propitiatorie sacrifice? si

                     h it is his bodye, who is the propitiation for the world. Nay, howe grosse is this consequence? seeing he was but once offered in sacrifice, and by that one oblation, found eternall redemption. Heb. 9. &amp; 10.
                  The 
                        •
                     enth grosse imagination is of him, who teacheth, that the wordes that are spoken of a gift presently

made and deliuered, be wordes of promise, and of preaching Nay rather it is a grosse imagination of him, which teacheth a gift to be made, deliuered, and receiued, when he which receiueth it, is neuer the better for it.
                  Finally, whatsoeuer the Papistes teach of the Sacrament, it is grosse falshood, and meere humane inuention contrarie to the holy Scriptures, the sense of which, and not the sounde of wordes grossely vnderstoode, is the worde of God.

                  The Apologie toucheth briefely, that the Councell Fulke of Nice, as it is cited in Greeke, of some, doth expressely forbidde vs, that wee shoulde not basely occupie ou

                      mindes about the breade and wine set before vs, Sander taketh paines to set downe the wordes at large, and gathereth great matters out of them. Iterum etiam hîc in diuina mensa, &amp;c. Againe, here also in the holy table, let vs not basely attende the breade and cuppe set before vs, but lifting vp our minde, let vs vnderstand by faith: That Lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the worlde, to be set on that holy table, to be vnbloudily sacrificed of the priestes, and that we truely taking his owne preciou
                           •
                         bodie and bloud, doe beleeue these to be the mysticall tokens of our redemption. For this cause wee ta
                           •
                        e not much but litle, that we may knowe we take not to fill vs, but for holines. Out of these wordes, ten argumentes he hath, to prooue, or to helpe to prooue, the reall presence of Christes body vnder the formes of bread and wine.
                  The first is, that bread and wine are set on the table, not to be basely considered, ergo they are changed into the body and bloud of Christ. This is a poore, and a forlorne helpe, and a miserable argument. For the contrary doth followe, the bread must not be basely considered,

                     ergo it is breade, although it be highly considered and regarded as the water in baptisme.
                  The second argument, is, that seeing the wordes of consecration be past (in respect of which, the Councell sayeth, the breade and wine must not be basely considered) the wordes did not onely make them a Sacrament, as in baptisme, &amp;c. but also did worke some reall thing vnder the formes of bread and wine, which remaineth still, as long as the saide formes and signes remaine. Nay rather, the Councell signifieth, that the celebration of the Sacrament and consecration thereof, is not perfite, before the vse and receite of it: whereof it speaketh soone after, and therefore is not to be basely considered, as common breade and wine, but sanctified to a special vse of an holy Sacrament and pledge of our redemption: as for the formes, and signes, and colours of breade and wine, the Councell speaketh not one worde of them, but of bread and the cuppe, which be substances, and not accidental formes.
                  The thirde, We must vnderstand (saith hee) not by seeing, but by lifting vp our mindes to heauen by faith. In deede, that is the onely waye to vnderstande the mysticall presence of Christes body &amp; bloud in the Sacrament.
                  The fourth, We must beleeue, that to be the Lambe of God, which is on the holy table, whereon standeth that which seemeth breade and wine. But the Councell speaketh not of that which seemeth, but of that which is breade and wine, and that by lifting vp of our mindes into heauen, by faith, Wee beleeue it to be the bodie and bloud of Christ.
                  The fifth, The Lambe is there so, that he is put, laide, and situate there, as a thing may be situate, which is vnder the formes of another thing. But if a man should aske you, howe that may bee? I marueile by what thing you woulde exemplifie it, and yet your wordes import a fimilitude. Therefore seeing it is without

example, your position is after an imagined manner. Whereas the Councell neuer thought of anye such quiditie, but that lifting vp our mindes into heauen by faith, wee vnderstande that Christ is dispensed vnto vs, by his holye mysteries, as wee are incorporated to him by baptisme, not that one thing is situated as another thing, which is no where, neither any such thing can bee shewed, and therefore is nothing, but an ydle toye of an euill occupyed brayne.
                  The sixt, The Lambe is so truely made present, that hee is outwardly offered of the Priestes, vnbloudily. Where haue you the worde, outwardly, or what argument haue you of an outwarde oblation, except you thinke Priestes cannot offer, but outwardly? Naye, rather in that the Councel sayth, the Lamb is offered vnbloudily, it signifieth, that it is not offered for a propitiatorie sacrifice, to take away sinnes, for without shedding of bloud, there is no sacrifice for sinnes, Hebr. 9. but that a remembrance of that onely insacrificable sacrifice of Christe, is celebrated in that holy action.
                  The seuenth, After the sacrifice made, the people doe partake with the altar, which could not bee, except a permanent substance were made by consecration. The Councell speaketh not of partaking with the altar, but of receiuing the body and bloud of Christ, in the mysticall tokens of our redemption, which ouerthroweth priuate Masse, Communion in one kinde, and transubstantiation, and sheweth the Sacrament not to be perfite, before it be receiued.
                  The eight, Truely taking of the precious body and bloud of Christ, is to take it really and bodily. The Councell speaketh of no bodily taking, but of taking by faith, when wee beleeue the breade and wine to bee the mysticall tokens of our redemption, wee truely take the precious bodye and bloude of Christ.
                  
                     
The ninth, taking of that which standeth before vs on the table, is by the instrument of our bodies: therefore it is deliuered by the corporall ministerie of the priestes, so that all is truely and externally done by the iudgement of the Councell. A shamelesse collection of a false argument. For that which standeth on the table, the Councell calleth breade, and the cuppe, which is taken and deliuered externally, and by corporall instruments, the rest must be vnderstoode by faith, which is not of externall things, but of things inuisible.
                  The tenth, we truely taking them, beleeue them to be the tokens of our redemption, or as some read, resurrection: for bread &amp; wine be not tokens of our redemption. Did bread and wine redeeme vs? or did they rise from death, quoth Sander? No verily: But the Councell saith for all that: that these things which are set on the table, namely, bread and the cupp, are beleeued of vs to be the mysticall tokens of our redemption, which the wordes following do declare. For this cause wee take not much, but litle, that we might knowe we take not to fill vs, but for holinesse. What can that be, whereof, not much but a litle is taken, but the breade and wine? for the body &amp; bloud of Christ, is not taken in quantitie more or lesse. Secondly, what neede wee by taking litle, be admonished, that it is not to fill vs, if wee did thinke there were no breade nor wine there, which could fill vs? Finally, why take we a little for holines, if we take that which is nothing but all holines it selfe, and of his owne nature, whether we take little or much. You see therefore, the Councell ment not to make Christes body a mysticall token of it selfe, which is a monstrous saying, and as monstrous an opinion, but the bread and wine in the sacrament, to be mysticall and diuine tokens of our redemption, wrought in the body and bloudshedding of our sauiour Christ. Wherefore the Apologie without fraude or purpose of deceiuing, hath left out no wordes of the Councell, that make against it, but whatsoeuer it hath omitted, it hath left of that aduantage, it might iustly haue taken, if it had throughly

and at large discussed them.

                  The author of the Apologie is charged with impudencie, Fulke. for alleaging the place of Chrysostome, in 1. Cor. Hom. 24. speaking of flying high with Eagles, vnto the bodie of Christ, as though the bodie of Christ were not vpon the altar, but we onely should by faith ascend into heauen, whereas Chrysostome speaketh of going into heauen by good life also, and not by faith onely. Afterward he rehearseth his words, but without the heade or former part of them, which sheweth that Chrysostome teacheth vs, howe we should come vnto Christe, and where wee shoulde finde him. Likewise he translateth corruptly, to drawe them to his imagined flying by good life.

                     nothing to doe with the earth, nor to be drawne downe and creepe to the lowe places, but alwayes to flie vp vnto the high places, and to beholde the sonne of righteousnes, and to haue the eie of the minde most cleare. For this is the table of Egles, not of Iayes. Iudge now whether Chrysostome meane to tell vs, that the bodye of Christe is vppon the altar, or in heauen. For wee must bee made Egles, not to hoouer vppon the table, but to flie vp into heauen, or rather aboue heauen. Wherefore must wee flie into heauen or aboue heauen? because Christ is there. Wherefore must hee that commeth to this bodie contende vnto the highest place, and to haue nothing to doe with the earth or lower places, if the bodie of Christ lyeth belowe vppon the table? But wee must haue a moste cleare eye of the minde, (sayeth Sander) to see the bodie of Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine, as an Egle flying on high, will fee a fish vnder the water, and catch it, as Augustine writeth. But Chrysostome teacheth vs, not to flye vpon high, to looke downe from on high, and see the bodie of Christ vnder the water or clowdes of accidentes, but alwayes to flye vp on high, and to beholde the sonne of righteousnesse, which is in heauen, and not belowe on earth; for if the bodie were come downe so lowe as the table, what neede wee flye from it, to beholde it from so great a distance?
                  And whereas hee sayeth, that wee are Iayes, because wee see weakely, and content our selues with a base banket of breade and wine: I woulde hee knewe, wee haue a moste cleare eye of the minde, which through that base banket of breade and wine, can beholde and see the verie bodye and bloud of Christe, sitting aboue all heauens, and flye so high with the winges of faith, that wee not onely see it, but also that wee are thereby fedde and nourished into eternall life.
                  That wee thinke good workes to bring small ayde to life euerlasting, it is, because wee flye like Egles to an higher cause, the onely mercy of GOD in

Iesus Christ, and Papistes bee like Iayes flying belowe, which thinke the vnperfect works of earthly and sinfull men, can helpe to bring them to perfecte happinesse in heauen. But (saith Sander) hee speaketh of the table, whiche standeth in the Church before vs, hee speaketh not nowe of heauen, which is aboue the sunne. This saith Sander, without all proofe and against all reason. For Chrysostome saith, it is the table of Egles, therefore it is an higher table then the table in the Church, where vnto we must flie vpwarde alwayes, euen into heauen, where that bodie, which once was deade, is nowe sitting in glorie, yea aboue all visible heauens, and therefore aboue the sunne. So that ye table in Chrysostome, signifieth metonymically, the spirituall meat and drinke, which the faithfull receiue by faith onelie, whereof the table on earth, with that which is on it, is onely a Sacrament, pledge &amp; assurāce. But Chrysostome in the same homily saith: If no man will rashly handle, an other mans garmente, howe dare wee to our greate shame and reproch, receiue this pure and immaculate bodie, which is the Lorde of all, which is partaker of the diuine nature, &amp;c. Heere (saith Sander) Chrysostome sheweth vs, to receiue the bodie of Christe, from the holy table or Altar, as truely concerning the substance thereof, as wee may truely touch another mans garment. I answere, hee speaketh in this place neither of Altar nor Table, and seeing hee hath before shewed, howe and from whence, Christes bodie is in deede receiued, if afterwarde, he call ye externall Sacramentes by the names of yt which they signifie, and performe to the worthie receiuer. What proofe is that, for the carnall presence? Neither doth he shewe at all, how truely Christes bodie is taken but what iniurie it is vnto his bodie, to haue his sacraments despised or vnworthily receiued.

                  This saying of Cyprian (saieth Sander) prooueth that Fulke. the substance of breade remaineth not: for materiall breade, cannot be meant of the minde, but of the bellie. Yes forsooth, as well as materiall water c
                        •
                     n serue for the washing of the minde. And yet Saint Peter saith, it is not the washing of the body, but the aunswere of a good conscience which is baptisme that saueth vs. Wherefore it may be materiall breade though not prepared to feede the body, but consecrated as a sacrament to feede the minde. The plaine meaning of Cyprian is, that the body of Christ, entreth not into the body of man, but into the minde: being no bodily foode, but spirituall foode, as the Apostle calleth it. 1. Cor. 10. As for that which Tertullian saith, The fleshe is fed with the bodie and bloud of Christ, yt the soule may be made fatte in God; I haue shewed before, howe it must of necessitie be vnderstoode, of the externall sacrament, which beareth the name of that whereof it is a sacrament, seing he speaketh there altogether of the externall signes receiued in the bodie, and vertue thereof applyed to the soule. But Cyprian saieth further, in the same treatise de coen▪ dom. Panis iste &amp;c. This breade which our Lorde gaue to his disciples, being chaunged not in shape, but in nature, is made flesh, by the almightie power of the worde. This place is often alledged by the Papistes, for transubstantiation, but Cyprian did meane no such matter, but onely that common bread by the almightie power of the worde of God, is chaunged from the nature of common breade, whiche is a bodily foode, to bee an heauenly and spirituall foode, as I haue declared more at large in answere to doctor Heskins. lib. 1. Cap. 17. and shall haue better occasion to speake of the same place repeted afterwarde.

                     Sacramental eating differeth from eating by faith alone, whereof Sander.
                        
onely Saint Augustine speaketh in the place alledged by the Apologie.
                  
                  The Apologie to shewe the naturall bodie of Christ, Fulke. not to be sought on the earth, but by faith in heauen, citeth this place of Aug. Tr. 50 in Ioan. How shall I hold him, that is absent? How shal I reach forth mine hand in
                           •
                        o heauē, that I might hold him there sitting? Reach out saith he faith, and thou hast caught him. Here Sander scoffeth out of measure, saying that Augustine in that place spake not one whit of the Sacrament, but of beleeuing in Christ, that hee speaketh not to the faithful, but to ye vnbeleeuing Iewes; and therefore it is one thing to receiue Christ by faith alone, another thing to receiue him by faith and sacrament together. In deede it is true, that Christ may bee receiued by faith alone, without the sacrament, and it is as true, that Christ is receiued by faith alone, with the sacrament, seeing by this place of Augustine, it is shewed, that Christ is absent from the earth, and to be sought in heauen onely by faith. No (saith Sander) although he be absent to infidels, that are not baptised, yet hee, is not absent to the faithfull, that are admitted to the Lords table. As though Augustine in the same treatise, sheweth not at large, that the bodie of Christe is not with the Church on earth, vpon these words, The poore you shal haue alwayes with you, but me you shall not haue: the place I haue ci

What is meant by not alwayes, and what is alwayes? If thou be a good man, if thou pertaine vnto the body of Christ, which Peter doth signifie, thou hast Christ, both in this presēt time, and in ye world to come. In this presēt world by faith, in this presēt world by ye signe of Christ, in this present world by the sacrament of baptisme, in this present world by the meate and drinke of the Altar, Thou hast Christ in this present world, and thou shalt alwayes haue him. For when thou shalt depart from hence, thou shalt come vnto him, which saide vnto the theefe: This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise. But if thou leadest an euill life, thou seemest to haue Christ in this present world, because thou comest into the Church, signest thee with the signe of Christ, art baptised with the baptisme of Christ, ioynest they selfe with the members of Christ, commest vnto the Altar of Christ, thou hast Christ in this present worlde, but by euill liuing thou shalt not alwayes haue him. By these wordes it is euident howe Christ is present in the meate and drinke of the Altar, namely as he is present in Baptisme, which is not corporally but spirituallie. Secondlie, yt the vngodly so receiue Christ in the sacraments, that they onely seeme to haue him, when in deede, they haue nothing but the signe of him. Thirdlie, that all the faithfull in Augustines time, receiued as well drinke as meate at the Altar. Last of all, while Sander iesteth at the penne
                        •
                      of the Apologie, hee sheweth him selfe most ridiculous of all. For although Augustine speaketh of the Iewes by Apostrophe, which hee wisheth might be
                        •
                      conuerted, yet hee speaketh in an homily or Sermon to the faithfull for their instruction, at which neuer a Iewe was present. And where as Sander argueth, that because no infidell was admitted to bee present in time of masse, therefore Augustine might not lawfully talke to a Iewe of the mysticall presence of Christ in the Sacrament: hee sheweth double follye, for why might hee not expounde euen to the Iewes, that which our Sauiour Christe him selfe spake to the vnbeleeuing Iewes of the eating and drinking of his flesh and bloud▪
                     
and secondly, when hee preached publikely of that mysticall presence, or writ of it in bookes which hee set abroade, to bee redde of all men, howe coulde hee prohibit infidels to heare the one or reade the other? And yet I knowe the ancient Fathers, had such regarde to speak of the mysteries of our religion, before infidels, that they shoulde not take an occasion to scorne them or deride them. Neuerthelesse they were not so daungerous, as Sander imagineth: Iustinus Martyr in his Apologie to the heathen emperors and Senate of Rome, and in his Dialogue with Tryphon the Iewe, feareth not plainely to expresse what the faith of the Christians was concerning these holy mysteries, wherefore Augustine although in these wordes he spake not of the presence of Christ in the Sacrament, yet in other words of the same homilie, as you haue seene, hee speaketh of the presence of Christ, euen in his sacraments.
               
            
            
               The third Booke.
               In the Preface of ye third Booke he promiseth to proue, First that Christ in the sixt of S. Iohn, spake of the gifte he made afterwarde in his parting banket. Secondly, yt the real presēce of his flesh and bloud, is euidently prooued by such words of promise, as he there vttered. Afterwarde he excuseth himselfe, that he is driuen to handle deepe &amp; obscure matters, being a poore scholler of Oxford, and yet inferior to 200, that were in the late Tridē
                  tine councel. So that if any Parliament man brought vp in hawking and hunting, think he writeth too profound ly for his vnderstanding, he must thinke, that he is lesse able to be a iudge of this whole controuersie, and of all questions in religion. As though it were necessarie, for euerie member of the Parliament, that shall entreate of cases of religion, to be trained vp in schoole points of Popish diuinitie, which the farther they be, from ye vnderstāding of yt cōmō people, y• further they are from faith &amp; Christiā religiō, which ought to be cōmonly know

to the simplest women and children. And albeit that euerie parliament man is not able of himselfe to iudge of al controuersies of religion, yet they altogether, by the instruction of so many godly learned men, as are among them, may decree what lawes are necessarie to bee made, for the aduancement of Gods glorie in religion, as well as for the furtherance of the common wealth in quiet &amp; tranquillitie. To conclude, his foolish preface hath neuer done craking of hard and difficult matters, as though he were a man of such ripe iudgement in them, that whatsoeuer he did write, were the Oracles of Apollo, where as in deede, euerie meane wise man shall easily perceiue, that when he would seeme to winde himself out of a difficult and intricate matter, hee sheweth more boldnesse in aduouching, then soundnes in his approuing.
               
                  CAP. I.
                  
                     The argument of the sixt chapter of saint Iohn, is declared. Sander.
                     
                  
                  First he affirmeth that Christ may bee receiued three Fulk. wayes, by faith and spirit onely without the Sacrament, in the Sacrament of the Altar onely without faith and grace, or in both together. Of the laste kind of receiuing, he affirmeth that Christ speaketh toward the later end of the Chap. In the beginning vpon occasion of the miracle of multiplying bread and fishes, he exhorteth the Iewes to worke the meate that perisheth not, which the sonne of man will giue them. This gift (saith hee) is plainelie meant of his last supper, and so saith Theophilact, a late writer. But because they could not come to the working of this gift, without faith vpon him, therefore hee teacheth, for a preparation, that he is the breade of life, &amp;c▪ After which preparation made, he returneth (saith he) to expounde his owne gifte, shewing most expressely, that, which he will giue in his last supper. And the breade which I will giue, is my flesh, for the life of the worlde. But the gift of spirituall eating was not to come, when Christ spake vnto his disciples,

but Christ saieth, his peculiar gifte was to come. This onely reason he vseth in this Chapter. Wherein you must note, first that heere of a falsifying minde, hee citeth the wordes of Christ otherwise then Saint Iohn did write them. For his wordes are these: And the breade that I will giue, is my fleshe, which I will giue for the life of the worlde. In which wordes, the gifte is manifestly referred vnto his passion, and not vnto his supper. Wherefore although spirituall eating of his fleshe, was from the beginning of the worlde, yet that singular act, by which the flesh of Christ had vertue to feede vnto eternall life, and was giuen for meate, was not then performed, but was soone after accomplished in his death and passion. For all benefites of Christe, haue like streames flowed alwayes, from the bloud of his crosse, and our redemption and reconciliation thereby. If Sander will excuse him selfe of falsifying the scripture, because the vulgar translation in the later ende of the sentence, leaueth out these words, which I will giue, which it is certaine, by the Greeke text of saint Iohn, that our sauiour Christ did speake, hee cannot so escape: for the Latine texte without his preiudicate opinion, brought vnto it, although it want the wordes, yet may well reteine the sense. But Sander wilfully leauing out these wordes, which he knoweth both to haue beene vsed by Christ, and which giue a cleere and cleane contrarie sense, to that whiche hee affirmeth, and that in so weightie a matter, as is the passion of Christe, wittingly incurreth the horrible cursse of GOD, pronounced against all them that adde or take any thing from his holie worde.
               
               
                  CAP. II.
                  
                     It is prooued by circumstances, and by the conference of holie Sander. Scriptures, that Christe speaketh in saint Iohn of his laste supper.
                  
                  The circumstances are 6. the conferences 17. and yet Fulk.
                     
neither any one, nor altogether, prooue, that Christ speaketh of his supper, otherwise then as it is a seale of the do ctrine which he teacheth in that Chapter.
                  The first circumstance is, ye time, which he supposeth to be Easter tweluemonth, before his supper instituted, to argue, that he speaketh of his supper, is a vaine argument, both because the time is vncertaine, and also because the time of Easter, if it were certaine, hath better relation to his passion, then to his supper.
                  The 2. circumstance is, the myracle made in breade. A ridiculous matter, as though it were not made also in flesh. But in deede the myracle made in meate, gaue occasion to that doctrine vttered in that Chapter, as S. Iohn sheweth. The 3. circumstance, the Propheticall promise, what he would doe the Easter tweluemoneth after. I answere, that promise was fulfilled in his passion.
                  The 4. the conference of thinges done and said about the sea of Tiberias, &amp; at Capernaum, with that was done and said in the last supper. This conference followeth afterward in the 17. conferences. The 5. the present eating of the fathers gift. The 6. the eating of Christes gift to come. To these two circumstances, I answere, that Christ exhorteth the Iewes to the present eating of his flesh, vpon paine of damnation: Except ye eate the flesh, &amp;c. He which eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, hath life euerlasting. Therfore the flesh &amp; bloud of Christ, might be eaten and drunken before his supper. Wherfore none of these circumstances do proue a promise of a sacramentall eating, which may be without profite, nor an eating of the naturall substance of flesh and bloud of Christ in the sacrament, which at that time was not instituted. But nowe we must come to the conferences. Foure of which conferences, are bread. 2. blessing. 3. thanksgiuing. 4. eating in both. I answere, so there was in all the dinners, and suppers that euer hee did make. Beside that, heere is multiplying, and fish, which is not in the last supper. Therefore a vaine conference. The fift is that as heere, hee beginneth his talke of common breade, and endeth with eating and drinking his fleshe and bloude, so in his

supper, hee tooke common breade in his handes, and ended his banket in eating and drinking of his body and bloude. But when Sander can make a consequence, of this conference, I will yeelde vnto it, that he speaketh of Sacramentall eating.
                  The 6 and 7. the sonne of man is the giuer, &amp; meate is giuen in both: ergo hee speaketh in both of the Sacraments. I denie the argument, for the meate which the sonne of man giueth, may bee eaten without the Sacrament, and therefore hee saith, he that nowe eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, when as yet that sacrament was not instituted. The 8. conference. Hee saith, the breade which I will giue, is my fleshe, and not the bread which I will take. So in his supper, he tooke one kinde of breade, and gaue another. This is a noble conference, to tel vs what Christ said not. According to which, I might conferre this: He saith, the breade which I will giue, hee saieth not, the drinke which I will giue, is my bloude, therefore in the supper he giueth not his bloude.
                  The 9. conference, the fleshe is giuen in the one, and nothing but the bodie in the other, for the substance of common breade was chaunged. This reason in deede is of great weight, if transubstantiation were granted.
                  The 10. No common breade is giuen in either of both places, if by common breade he meant prophane breade, and not dedicated to holy vse. I confesse the conference, but seeing by common breade, he meaneth naturall breade, I denie it. For though no naturall or materiall breade was promised to bee giuen in the sixte of Saint Iohn, yet was naturall breade giuen in the Sacrament.
                  The 11. The fleshe that dyed for vs, is giuen in both. That is true, but after diuerse manners: in the one it is giuen in a Sacrament, in the other more generally, but in both to bee spiritually receiued, and not carnally. The 12. The gift is eaten in deede in both: I confesse, but spiritually and by faith, yet with this difference, that in the one, it is eaten often without

the sacrament, the other is a seale or a sacrament of that, which is eaten euen without it.
                  The 13. The bloude of Christ is drunke in both. It is so drunke, as the flesh is eaten. The 14. As in the sixt of Iohn, there is no wine spoken of: so Christ in his supper neither spake of wine, but of drinking, nor gaue any wine at all to bee drunke, because it was by his wordes chaunged into his bloude. I answere, If bread were spoken of, in that which was taken into his hands, wine by Metonymia was spoken of, by taking the cuppe. Secondly, if the fruite of the vine be the matter of wine, wine was spoken of. At Caparnaum, there was no wine spoken of, nor any occupied. Let Sander see howe hee can make the conference with the supper, in which wine was occupied, although he say, it was not drunk, which is a weightie argument, when that which is in question, is brought for the proofe. Last of all, if Christ at his supper, gaue no wine at all to be drunke (as Sander saith) howe agreeth the Popish communion with Christs supper? seeing the Papistes doe giue wine to bee drunke, vnto the laye people.
                  The 15. The twelue Apostles most faithfull, taried with him at Caparnaum, so they alone were admitted in the night of his betraying, to his holy table. In ye faithfull tarying of the twelue Apostles, he forgetteth Iudas, and that the twelue onely were present at the institution of the supper, it is vncertaine. For it is certaine there was more then twelue present at the eating of the Passeouer: and it is prooued before, that Iudas went out before the Sacrament ordeined.
                  The 16. Peter with the twelue protested in both places, not to forsake Christe. So they did at other times and places, where no mention was of eating Christ. The last, Iudas was reprooued in both places. I answere, Iudas was reprooued in other places, where no promise or mention of the supper is made. Finally I answere, that not any one, nor altogether of these conferences, can make any consequence, to prooue that our Sauiour Christ in that sixt of Iohns Gospel, speaketh of

the Sacrament, otherwise then as it is a seale, a pledge, an vndoubted token of assurance, of that spirituall eating &amp; drinking of Christs flesh and bloud, which in that Chapter is commended vnto vs.
               
               
                  CAP. III.
                  
                     It is prooued out of the holy Fathers and generall councels, that Sander. Christ in S. Iohn spake of his last supper.
                  
                  I haue shewed euen nowe, in what sort Christ may Fulk. bee saide to haue spoken of his last supper, in that chapter; and of that sense and meaning, are the most ancient and sounde fathers, whome Sander citeth to bee vnderstoode. And not one which affirmeth the eating of Christes fleshe and bloude, which there is spoken of, to bee peculiar vnto the supper, and singulerly to bee vnderstoode of eating in the sacrament, and not otherwise: which is the onely thing which we denie, and not that the doctrine of that Chapter, doeth not at all pertaine to the supper, but that it is further to bee extended, then to the supper, by which, the carnall manner of eating of Christes flesh, is manifestly ouerthrowne. But let vs briefely, runne ouer his authorities. First Ignatius, Clemens, Alexandrinus, and Origen hee omitteth, because they speake nothing almost sounding to his purpose. But Cyprian in orat, dominica, seemeth vnto him clearely, to prooue, that it is ment of the supper, because hee writeth, that who so is any long time kept from the sacrament, is in daunger of euerlasting life: alleaging this text of saint Iohn: Except yee eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, &amp;c. For hee shoulde wholie faile of his proofe (saith he) if that place did not prooue the necessitie of communicating sacramentally. I denie the argument: for hee speaketh of them which were cut off from the bodie of Christ by excommunicatiō, whose admission vnto the cōmunion, was an assurance of their incorporation againe. This place is answered more at large in my confutation of Heskins lib. 2, cap. 4.

The second is Athanasius in syn. nou. test lib. 4. which saith, Christ reasoneth with the multitude concerning the misteries. A sorie argument, as though the spirituall eating of Christs flesh were not a mysterie. It had bene very vnseasonable, to reason with them of that which as yet was not instituted, although as I haue saide, his doctrine may be extended also to ye sacrament. The 3. is Hilarie lib. 8. de Trin. disputing of the natural veritie of Christ, which is in vs by the sacrament, alleageth these wordes: My flesh is meat in deede. I answere, Hilarie affirmeth that the naturall veritie of Christes flesh is in vs, by his incarnation if we be faithfull, which is testified by the mysterie and sacrament of bread and wine. Therefore he saith, n
                           ••
                        què verè sub mysterio carnem corporis sui sumimus: we doe truely, vnder a mysterie, take the flesh of his bodie: Againe, naturam carnis suae ad naturam aeternitatis sub sacramento nobi

                        it: hee hath ioyned the' nature of his flesh vnto the nature of eternitie, vnder a sacrament of his flesh to be communicated with vs. The 4. is Basil, Dei bap lib. 1. Cap. 3. comparing the words of his supper, with the words of this Chapter, which prooueth not the matter in hande, otherwise then I haue shewed, but of Basil wee must see more afterward touching this controuersie. The 5. is Gregorie Nyssene his brother, in vita Mosis, who saith: that the breade which came downe frō heauē, which is ye true meat, is no vnbodily thing, for howe should a thing that lacketh a bodie, be made mea
                        ••
                      vnto the bodie? Doubtlesse (saith Sander) Christ is made meate vnto our bodies, no where but onely in the Sacrament. Sanders Doubtles, is all the argument, iudge of it as ye list. The 6. is Cyrillus of Ierusalem in Catech. Mistagog. 4. who intreating of ye Sacrament, citeth these words, except ye eate: ergo these words are to be vnderstood only of eating in the sacrament. Heere hee desireth license, being cōpassed with such a multitude of witnesses brieflie to runne ouer the rest, as he hath not beene very long in any of the other, and the like license I require, that one answere may serue them al, which are worth the answering; that although the Fathers did referre the doctrine

of the sixt of S. Iohn, vnto the supper: yet they referre it not onely vnto the supper, which is the matter we sticke vpon. Neither Ambrose, nor Eusebius Emissenus, &amp; much lesse Chrysostom &amp; Augustine, which do plainly extende it further then to the supper. And last of all Hierom in the place by Sander cited, in 1. Cap. Ep. ad Eph. where he saith, the fleshe and bloud of Christ is vnderstanded two wayes, either that spirituall &amp; diuine, wherof he sayd: My flesh is meate in deede, &amp;c. or else, that flesh which was crucified for vs, &amp; that bloud which was s
                        •
                     ed with the speare of ye souldier. Where either he speaketh not of the Sacrament at all, or else he declareth manifestly, that the flesh which was crucified, is not giuen vs in this Sacrament. And what his iudgement is of that place, he sheweth euidently 
                        in Ps. 147. Quando dicit, qui non comederit carnem meam, &amp; biberit sanguinem meum, licet &amp; in mysterio possit intelligi, tamen verius corpus Christi &amp; sanguis eius sermo scripturarum est, diuina doctrina est. Whē he saith, he which shall not eate my flesh, nor drinke my bloude, &amp;c. although it may be vnderstood in the mysterie, yet more truely the bodie of Christ &amp; his bloud is ye wordes of the scriptures, it is the doctrine of God. The next is Cyrillus, whome Sander most impudently affirmeth to interpret the whole Chapter of the Sacrament of the altar, because sometime he nameth the mysteries, and the mysticall blessing, and the communicating of the holye cup. For thus he expoundeth that saying, which Sander maketh the promise of his supper. The bread, which I wil giue, is my flesh which I will giue for the life of the worlde.

Cap. 16.

                     Answere is made to their obiections, who teach out of the holy Sander. fathers that the sixt Chapter of S. Iohn ought to be expounded only of spirituall eating.
                  
                  Where it is alleaged, that the fathers expound the wordes of that Chapter, partly of beliefe in Christ, partly Fulk. of the vnitie which riseth by the Sacramentes of baptisme and penance (saith Sander) this shal be a sufficient answere. First so many fathers do 
                        •
                     et expound it of any others argument, as do conformably expound it of the supper of our Lord.
                  To this I reply, y• al or in a maner all do interprete it of our spiritual coniunction, with the body and bloud of Christ, whereof the supper is a Sacrament, and confirmation. Secondly he answereth, that those fathers which haue expounded the wordes otherwise then of the supper,

haue also expounded them of the supper, whereby their authority is as great, for that which I say, as it is against it. I reply, that none of them expoundeth the wordes of the supper so, as they be singular vnto the supper, and therefore none of them maketh for Sanders purpose; nor expounde them otherwise then I haue shewed in reply to the first answere.
                  Thirdly he answereth, that no one of the fathers is brought forth, who denieth these words in S. Iohn to apperteine to the supper. A lewde answere, for none of vs denieth those wordes to apperteine to the supper, but to be a promise singularly to be referred to the supper. Fourthly, many of the places brought for the contrary opinion, doe manifestly and as it seemeth to Sander, inuincibly prooue the wordes in S. Iohn to be literally ment of the supper of Christ. This shall appeare by the examples following. First Cyprian ad Quir
                           •
                        num lib. 3. Cap. 25. &amp; 26. writeth that a man can not come to the kingdom of heauen without baptisme, because it is writen: Except a man be borne againe, &amp;c. and likewise, Except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c. Heere (saith Sander) he expoundeth not the wordes of baptisme, but meaneth according to the custome of the Church, which was to giue the cummunion to infantes, not so much for necessity, as for suerties sake, of which custome we haue mention in Dionysius, Ambrose, and other. The like answer (he saith) may be made to Innocentius, Augustinus, and Eusebius Emissenus, which bring these wordes against the Pelagians: Except'ye eat the flesh, &amp;c. to prooue that infantes can not haue life, except they be baptized. To this I reply: it can not be denied, but such an erronious custome cōtrary to ye word of God, was vsed in those ancient times, to giue the communion to infantes, whereof grew afterward an opinion of necessity, which Pope Innocentius and Augustine, and all the West Church, (as Augustine saith) did hold, although Cont. dua
                           •
                         epist. Pel. lib. 2. Cap. 4. Sander would excuse it, to haue bene practised not for necessity, but for suerty: yet hereof it followeth not, that the wordes of S. Iohn in Cyprian and the rest,

are literally vnderstoode of the supper, otherwise then as the supper is a Sacrament of that eating and drinking the flesh and bloud of Christ, which Sander confesseth may to be without the Sacrament, euen of such eating of the flesh of Christ, as the fathers were partakers of, vnto their saluation, before Christ came in the flesh, wherof Augustine speaketh most plentisully. In Ioan Tr. 26. and concludeth of this question: 
                        Huius rei Sacramentum, id est vnitatis corporis, &amp;c. A Sacrament of this thing, that is of the vnitie of the body and bloud of Christ, in some places euery day, in some places by certaine distances of daies, is prepared in the Lords table, and from the Lords table is receiued: of some to life, of some to destruction. But the thing it selfe, whereof it is a Sacrament, is receiued of euery man to life, of none to destruction, whosoeuer shall be pertaker of it. And because, Sander saith, the maintenance of life dependeth ordinarily vpon the Eucharist alone: The same Augustine saith to the contrary, 
                        Hoc est ergo manducare illam escam, &amp; illum bibere potum in Christo manere, &amp; illum manentem in se habere. Ac per hoc qui non manet in Christo, &amp; in quo non manet Christus, pro
                              •
                           ul dubio nec manducat spiritualiter carnem eius, nec bibit eius sanguinem, licet carnaliter &amp; visibiliter premat dentibus Sacramentum corporis &amp; sanguinis Christi, sed magis tantae rei Sacramentum ad iudi
                              •
                           itan sibi manducat &amp; bibit. For this it is to eate that meate, and to drinke that drinke, to abide in Christ and to haue him abide in vs. And by this, he which abideth not in Christ, &amp; in whom Christ doth not abide, out of al doubt, neither doth he eate spiritually his flesh, not drinke his bloud, although carnally and visibly, he presse with his teeth, the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, but rather he eateth and drinketh the Sacrament of so great a thing, vnto his own damnation. Heere Augustine opposeth the eating of Christes flesh spiritually, with eating the Sacrament thereof carnally, whereby he sheweth, that Christes flesh is not eaten but spiritually and effectually, although the Sacrament thereof be eaten carnally to destruction. And by this you may see, howe well red Sander is in Augustine,

which professeth, that in his workes he neuer sawe one sillable, why to thinke that he would the litteral sense of the sixt of S. Iohn to belong onely to spirituall eating, when Augustine saieth expressely, This is to eate that meat, to eate spiritually, to haue Christ abiding in vs, &amp;c. But yt same Augustine de peccat. merit. lib 1. Cap. 20. saith: 
                        Dominum audiamus, inqu
                              •

                           us accedit. Nisi manducaueritis carnem meam, &amp;c. Let vs heare our Lord, I say, not saying in deede, this of the Sacrament of baptisme, but of the Sacrament of his holy table, whither no man commeth well, vnlesse he be baptized. Except ye eate my flesh and drinke my bloud, you shall not haue life in you, &amp;c. Heere (saith Sander) it is plaine by Augustines iudgment, yt Christ in that Chapiter speaketh not of baptisme, and that he speaketh of his supper. I answer, Augustin writeth against the Pelagians, which denied baptisme to be necessary for infantes, as for them that had no originall nor actual sin, laboring to prooue the necessity of baptisme by those wordes of Christ: Except a man be borne of water, and of the holy Ghost, &amp;c. to bring infantes vnder the compasse of sinne and to establish their saluation onely by grace, &amp; not by merite of their workes. His cause in deede was good, but his argument was weake, to proue the necessity of baptisme by that texte, euen as to prooue the necessity of communion for infantes by this text, of the 6. of S. Iohn, which is not needful, nor lawful to be giuen vnto them at all. Yet such was his error, that he thought infantes were charged by this text to cōmunicate in paine of dā
                     nation. That he iudged they ought to be partakers of ye body &amp; bloud of Christ, it is true by yt text, but that he thought this partaking was by the Sacrament in young children, he was deceiued, yet Sander saith, it was not of necessity, but of surety, whereas Augustines error is manifest to vrge it of necessity. 
                        An verò quisquā etiā hoc dicere audebit, quòd ad paruulos haec sententia nō pertineat? possint
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            sine participatione corporis h
                              〈…〉
                           us &amp; sanguinis in se habere vitā, quia non ait, Qui non manducauerit, sicut de baptismo qui nō renatus fuerit, &amp;c.
                        
Is there any man that dare say this also, that this sentence pertaineth not vnto young children, and that they may without the participation of this body and bloud haue life in them, because he sayeth not, he that shall not eate, as of baptisme, he that shall not be borne againe? I will make answere to Augustine not in defence of the Pelagians, but in discouering of his error. Regeneration is vndoubtedly proued necessarie for infants, by that place of Iohn 3. as eating and drinking of the body and bloud of Christ in this 6. of Iohn: which is ynough to ouerthrowe the Pelagians, but neither in the one place, nor in the other, the necessitie of the external sacrament is required, but as it may possibly, and ought to be profitably receaued according to the worde of God. Wherefore Augustine in this place applying the text vnto the sacrament, in arguing from the signe to the thing signified, or contrariwise, must be vnderstoode according to his deliberate exposition, in Ioh. Tr. 26. or else he should bee founde contrary to himselfe. And whereas Sander sayeth, This text so appertaineth to the supper, as it appertaineth not to baptisme, and therefore can not be taken of the spirituall vniting with Christ which is in baptisme: I deny the argument, for although it doth not so properly pertaine to the sacrament of washing, as to the sacrament of feeding and nourishing: yet doeth it also pertaine to baptisme, in as much as by baptisme we are not only washed by Christs bloud from our sinnes, but wholy regenerate, &amp; borne a newe to be the children of God, which wee cannot be, but by participation of flesh &amp; bloud with our brother Iesus Christ, and therefore we are also in baptisme spiritually fed with his body and bloud.
                  To that which is brought out of Basil, Ep. 141. That Christ in this text calleth his whole mystical comming, flesh and bloud: Sander answereth, that saying may be verified of the Sacrament of his supper, because he that receiueth worthily, is partaker of all the mysteries of Christ. But that it cannot be singularly applyed to the Sacrament, which is all the question, his owne wordes

shall declare.  
                        Edimus enim ipsius carnem, &amp; bibimus ipsius sanguinem per incarnationem participes fientes &amp; sensibitis vitae verbi &amp; sapientiae. Carnem enim &amp; sanguinem totum suum mysterium aduentum nominauit, &amp; doctrinam &amp; actiua &amp; naturali, ac theologica constantem indicauit per quam nutritur anima, &amp; interim ad veritatis speculationem praeparatur. For wee eate his flesh and drinke his bloud, being made partakers by his incarnation both of sensible life of the word and of wisedome. For hee named his whole mysticall comming flesh and bloud, &amp; shewed his doctrine, consisting of actiue, naturall and theologicall, by which the soule is nourished, and in the meane time prepared vnto the beholding of the trueth. Thus by Basils iudgement, by faith in Christes incarnation and doctrine, wee eate his flesh and bloud, whereof wee are assured by the Sacrament, therefore the text is not a singular promise of Christes naturall flesh, to be after a corporall maner receiued in the Sacrament.
               
               
                  CAP. V.
                  
                     Their reasons are answered, who denye Christ to speake properly Sander. of his last supper in S. Iohn.
                  
                  The reasons are for the most parte such, as Papistes Fulke. haue made, which thinke in their conscience, that this Chapter is not properly to be referred to the Sacramēt: against whome Sander opposeth him selfe, not regarding with what conscience, but with what shewe of wordes, he may maintaine his false position against all men. The argumentes as he numbreth them, are fiue. The first is this: There is no mention of bread and wine in this Chapter: ergo, it speaketh not of the supper. This argument Sander denyeth, because a man may be inuited to a pastie or tarte, although it be not tolde him of what stuffe it shalbe made. Good stuffe I warrant you. Againe, he saith, the matter of a sacrament, is not more necessarie, then the forme of wordes. But Christ saying to Nicodemus: Except a man be borne againe of water, &amp;c. although he

name the matter, sheweth not the wordes that make the Sacrament, yet speaketh he there of baptisme, ergo here of ye supper. I denie that he speaketh of baptisme there, otherwise then of the supper here, by comprehending ye seale of assurance vnder the promise of the thing it selfe. But this argument Sander alloweth wel: Christ speaketh not of bread nor wine, therfore he meaneth not to bind vs to receiue vnder both kindes, but to receiue that thing which is his flesh and bloud vnder what kind soeuer wee receiue it. If this be true, it were well done to take the bread from the people another while, &amp; to serue them of the cup consecrated, for a whole communion. But behold the synceritie of this Academical disputer, alowing this argument to mainteine horrible sacrilege, as though Christ doth not name drinking, almost as often as eating: although he name neither bread nor wine. And if his bloud be drinke in deede, then is it not receiued wt the bread, which is not drunke, but eaten.
                  The second argument is, Christ speaketh of eating him by faith &amp; therfore saith: this is the worke of God, that you should beleeue in him, whome he hath sent. He that beleeueth in me, shall not hunger: but there be some of you which beleeue not, so yt the eating is beleeuing, &amp; ye not eating is, not beleeuing. To this argument grounded vpon the authoritie of Scripture, he hath nothing to answere, but by a lewd distinction of eating of Christ, that is of his grace by faith, &amp; eating Christ, that is his whole flesh, bloud, soule &amp; godhead into our bodies, by colour of these words, Manducare ex hoc pane, &amp; manducare hunc panem, which our sauiour Christ manifestly cōfoundeth, &amp; vseth for all one. But that you may see his grosse folly &amp; madnesse, you must remember yt he maketh these words to be the chiefe wordes of promise of his supper; The bread which I wil giue, is my flesh, &amp;c. Now ye whol context is this: I am yt liuing bread which came downe frō heauen, if a man eat of this bread, he shall liue for euer, &amp; the bread which I wil giue, is my flesh, which I wil giue for the life of the world. Marke now what will become of Sanders distinction. To eat of this bread, is to

be partaker of grace, by faith, which he confesseth, may be wtout the Sacrament. But that bread wherof he shall eate, is the flesh of Christ, which he will giue for the life of the worlde: therefore, to eate the flesh of Christ, is to receiue Christ by grace, although it be without the Sacrament.
                  The third argument is, Christ was presently ye breade of life, when he spake to the Iewes, saying I am ye bread of life, and my father giueth you the true bread from heauen, therfore Christ was the bread of life, when hee was first incarnat, for euen then hee came downe from heauen. Therfore his wordes cannot be applyed to his last supper, which was not yet instituted. Sander confesseth, that Christ was by his godhead and manhod, the bread of life to be eaten of the Iewes, presently by faith, and not corporally. But he saide also: Worke the meate which the sonne of man will giue you, and the bread which I wil giue, is my flesh: which gift is fulfilled in his supper. For no reason can be shewed (saith he) why Christ shoulde say, his gift was to come, except it had bene some other gift then to eate him by faith alone, which was lawfull at that instant. To this answere of Sander, I replye: first that he groundeth vpon a strange translation of his owne, of working the meate, &amp;c. Secondly, of a patching together of twoo textes that stande farre a sunder. Thirdly, the worke of meate spoken of in the former text, whereunto they are exhorted, is expounded of faith by Christ himselfe immediately after: This is the worke of God, that you should beleeue in him whom he hath sent. Fourthly, the gift which Christ saith, in the Future tense he would giue, prooueth not that it was yet present, but promiseth it, to them that will receiue it presently. For if a mā haue a Ring in his hand; he may truly say to them that stande before him: I will giue a Ring to them that shall first come to me. Heere the worde of giuing is in the Future tense, promysing the Ring to him that shall come first for it; yet for all that is the Ring still in his hande.

Fifthly, this reason I shewe, why Christ saieth, hee will giue his flesh for the life of the worlde, which presently might be eaten, and was eaten, almoste foure thousand yeares before, because his passion, by which it is communicated to the faithfull of all ages, at that time when he spake, was not perfourmed in act, although in effect he was the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the worlde.
                  The fourth argument, which hee consesseth to be of Caietane, is that Christes gifte is not meant of his supper, because it was the gift of himself, to death vpon the crosse, such as shall redeeme the worlde. Which gift was onely perfourmed vpon the crosse, and was partaken alwayes of the olde fathers, and may be daily and hourely partaken of vs, which points do not agree with the gift of the holy Eucharist in Christes supper. This argument (saith Sander) is wittily deuised: no doubt, because it was vsed by Caietane a Papist, but yet it is insufficient for many causes.
                  The first cause is, because Christ spake of a meate that he would giue, euen vnto our bodies, and not onely vnto our soules. Howe proueth he, that he spake of such a meate? because he ordeined the miracle of multiplying the fiue loaues to be an introduction vnto this talk, which loaues were eaten corporally, as also that he shewed himself to be the true bread, that would fulfil and exceede Manna, the figuratiue bread of the Iewes. Two blinde causes, as though he might not take occasion of corporall eating, to speake of spiritual eating, as in the fourth of Iohn, of corporall drinking he taketh occasion to instruct the woman of Samaria, of spiritual drinking, and in the same Chapter, his Apostles of corporall eating, hee teacheth them what spirituall meate was. As for the figure of Manna, of which he speaketh, as of a corporall meate, whereof they that did eate, died: our Sauiour Christ was euen to them that did eate it faithfully, life euerlasting; &amp; Manna was the flesh of Christ vnto them. But the distinction and contradiction which Christ maketh of Manna and this bread, is that which is

necessarie to be betweene the bare signe, and the thing signified, from which to reason, as Sander doeth, Manna was eaten corporally and spiritually, therefore the fleshe of Christ is to be eaten corporally and spiritually; is to ioygne together, things that are to be deuided, which is a poore shift of Sophistrie. Beside that, it is a ridiculous argument, to reason of the similitude of those thinges, wherein the auctor sheweth them to be vnlike. For our Sauiour saith, not as your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernes, of which saying, it is much more probable to reason, your fathers did eate Manna corporally, therfore you shall not eate this breade which I will giue corporally. But he obiecteth that Origen saith: as it is alleaged in the decrees, De Cons. Dist. 2. C. De hac. No man eateth properly the flesh of Christe as it was crucified. Therefore Christ speaketh not of his death. Nay rather therefore no man eateth Christe corporally, for hee was crucified corporally. But Sander will haue vs to marke, that Saint Hierom distincteth the flesh of Christ, whereof he speaketh in Saint Iohn▪ 
                     from the respect which the same flesh hath, being crucified. in Ep. ad Eph. Chap. 1. Saint Ierom saith, the flesh of Christ is two wayes to be considered. that spirituall and diuine fleshe, whereof he speaketh, when he sayth, My flesh is meate in deede, &amp;c. &amp;, except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c. and that flesh which was crucified. This distinction is of the maner of receiuing the one, which is onely spiritually, and of the maner of handling the other, which was corporally, or it is that distinction which is betweene the effect and the cause. Such difference is by Ierom, betweene Christ crucified, and Christs bodie eaten and drunken, which Sander would haue to be all one in substance and differ onely in eating.
                  The second reason, that Christ speaketh of his supper, as well as of his death, is, that the Greeke text mentioneth two giftes: The bread that I will giue, is my fleshe, which I wil giue for the life of the world. Here (saith he) is, I wil giue, twise: ergo two gifts, and then he defendeth the Greeke text to be true, although the Latine haue, I

wil giue but once. You see the cunning of the man, that can make them both serue his purpose. But it is Popish Logike, to conclude two giftes of saying twise, I will giue, as in this example: The lande which I will giue you, is the maner of Dale, which I wil giue to you and to your heires. Here is, I will giue twise: therefore two gifts by Master Doctor Sanders Logike. O wonderfull learning of Popish Doctors!
                  The third reason is, that Christ speaking of the meat, saith, the sonne of man dabit vobis, will giue to you, and not only for you. But his death was giuen more properly for vs, then to vs. For it was paied to God for our debtes, but was not properly giuen to vs, for then a sacrifice should be made of Christ to vs, and consequently God the father robbed of his glorie. What say you Sander? Can nothing be said properly to be giuen vs, but that which is sacrificed vnto vs? So God loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten sonne, that euery one which beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue life euerlasting. Iohn. 3. And Esai saith, The sonne is giuen to vs. The spirit of God is giuen to vs, &amp;c. is there no gift but by way of sacrifice? are you not ashamed of such senseles shiftes? Christ in his death was giuen in sacrifice to his father for vs, and his father being reconciled to vs, by that sacrifice, giueth him to vs, and Christ also giueth himselfe for vs, because all the fruite of his death, and sacrifice is referred to our saluation. The fourth reason is, that Christ, naming breade, meate, foode, Manna, &amp;c. promiseth an eatable thing, which is his flesh in a banket, the Iewes vnderstoode his flesh really, not erring in vnderstanding, but in faith: for Christ cōfirmeth their vnderstanding with an oth, sayth: verily, verily, except ye eat the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c. ergo, their sense which reterre the gift onely to his death, is not sufficient, but it must be meant also of the last supper. This argument followeth not: for although the names of bread, food, flesh, &amp;c. proue that Christes flesh is eatable, yet it proueth not, that it is eatable only in the supper. Secondly, that the Iewes erred only in faith, it is false, for

they erred also in vnderstanding, taking the eating of Christes flesh to be perfourmed carnally, which he ment only spiritually. His oth confirmeth not their vnderstā
                     ding, but his owne promise of giuing his flesh for ye life of the world, which except they did eat spiritually, they could haue no life in them. But whereas it is obiected, yt Christ speaketh of that gift, which was common to the whole world, euen to ye Patriarkes &amp; Prophets, &amp; therefore it is a spirituall gift, for else Dauid &amp; Abrahā could not haue partaken it: he answereth, yt Christ doth not pro mise any one meat vnto the whole world, but his flesh to be eaten, which is giuen for the whole world. I reply: ye words are plaine, the bread which I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world, &amp; not only for the Iewes. Neither doth Christ in his supper, giue a far better meat, than he gaue to Moyses &amp; Elias, for he gaue euen to thē, his flesh &amp; bloud, to be their spiritual food vnto eternal life: witnesse the Apostle to the 1. Cor. 10. that all our fathers did eat &amp; drink the same spiritual meat, that we do, and that their meat &amp; drinke was Christ. Concerning yt dayly we may eat that bread which Christ promiseth, he answereth, the Sacrament is left to be our daily &amp; supersubstantial bread, either because we may receiue it daily if we wil, or because it tarieth alwayes with vs by some spirituall effect.
                  To this I answere, that all men cannot receiue it daily, and some men not at all, which yet must haue spirituall foode to feede them vnto euerlasting life: therefore, this breade may be eaten without the Sacrament.
                  The last argument that he woulde seeme to answere, is this: Christ in S. Iohn, speaketh of that eating, which maketh vs tarie in him, &amp; him in vs, therefore not of Sacramental eating: for Christ tarieth not in all that eate him in the Sacrament. He answereth, the fault is not in ye Sacrament, but in them yt abuse the gift of God to their own hurt. As though our Sauiour Christ did speak only of ye power of his flesh, being eaten, &amp; not of ye effect. The flesh of Christ being eaten, maketh vs one wt him, &amp; him

But Augustine is cited, contr. Crescon. gram. lib. 1. Cap. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Quid de ipso corpore, &amp;. what say we concerning the very body and bloud of our Lorde, the only sacrifice for our saluation? Although our Lord himselfe saith: Except a man doe eate my flesh, and drinke my bloud, he shall not haue life in him, doth not the Apostle teach, that the selfe same thing is made hurtfull to them that vse it euill? For he saith: whosoeuer shall eate the bread and drinke the cuppe of the Lord vnworthily, he shall be guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord. But it followeth immediatly in Augustine: E
                           •
                        ce quemadmodum obsint diuina &amp; sanctamatè vtentibus. Cur non eodem modo baptismus? See how diuine and holy thinges doe hurte them that vse them amisse. Why not baptisme after the same manner? These last wordes declare that Augustine saying that the body and bloud of Christ, may be hurtfull, speaketh of the Sacrament, and not of the thing or matter of the Sacrament, as in baptisme. As he teacheth in exposition of the doctrine of Christ in Saint Iohn. The Sacrament of this thing, (saith he) is receiued of som to life, of some to destruction, but the thing it selfe, or matter of the Sacrament, which is the body and bloud of Christ, is of none receiued to destruction, but of all vnto life, as many as receiue it. By whose whole discourse it is manifest, that Augustine vnderstandeth Christ speaking of spirituall eating, which may be without the Sacrament: and maketh a difference betwene ye meat there spoken of, which presently was offered to be eaten, &amp; the Sacrament therof which afterward was instituted. Therfore whatsoeuer Sander doth glory, of all authority vpon earth, concurring to his position, there is no authority from heauen, to prooue, that Christ in the 6. of S. Iohn spake of his supper at all, or that his supper may be vnderstood therin, otherwise then the Sacrament and seale of that spirituall and heauenly eating &amp; drinking of Christes flesh and bloud, which of the fathers and of all the faithfull hath bene eaten and drunken, vnto eternall life, not only in this Sacrament, but in other Sacramentes of Gods ordeining, and without all Sacramentes, by faith and power of Gods spirite.

                        o giue, is meant of his reall flesh and bloud to be giuen at his last supper.

But that the same is to be giuen only at his last supper, which is the onely matter in controuersie, he is not able to prooue. His first reason is, that because Christ saieth, his flesh is meate in deede, the word verè declareth not only a metaphorical worke, by faith, but a true worke of the body and soule, the one in beleeuing, the other in eating. As though Christ is not meat truly, when he is eaten by faith in the soule, or as though a metaphorical meat, can not be called a meate truly or in deede, when Christ speaking metaphorically, saith he is a true vine. But Tertullian saieth, the flesh feedeth of the body and bloud of Christ, as before wee haue often heard, where he speaketh of externall Sacramentes and outwarde signes, as of baptisme, oynting, imposition of hands, &amp;c. What Theophylact a late writer saith, we esteem not worth ye weighing. But Cyrillus he alleageth for his purpose, who referreth the gift plainly to the incarnation of Christ, and not to his supper: 
                        In Ioan. lib. 3. Cap. 28. Diuina humanis, &amp;c. He hath ioyned the thinges of man to the thinges of God, and touched the whole mystery of his incarnation, &amp;c. Last of all, he citeth Ignatius in Ep. ad Romanos, who expoundeth the bread, and flesh, and bloud spiritually, and not of ye Sacrament. 
                        Non mihi placet, &amp;c. The perishing meate and pleasures of this life please me not. I will haue the bread of God, the heauenly breade, the breade of life, which is the flesh of Christ the sonne of God, and I will

haue the cupp of his bloud which is incorruptible loue and life euerlasting. If the cuppe of Christes bloud be incorruptible charity and life euerlasting, then is it the effect of Christes bloud, that Ignatius speaketh of, and not his naturall bloud, which is the cause thereof. Other prooues then these, Sander hath not in this Chapter for his purpose, which prooue it nothing at all.
               
               
                  CAP. VII.
                  
                     The equality of substance with his father, which Christ alleageth Sander. for his gift, prooueth the reall presence of his body and bloud in the Sacrament of the altar, euen as God the father gau
                           •
                         him reall flesh and bloud at his incarnation.
                  
                  This argument is thus framed: The sonne of man i
                           •
                         equall 
                     Fulk. 
                     with God his father. God the father hath giuen his sonne to the world, and made him true man, the true bread of life: therefore God the sonne being equall with his father, will giue vs the same true flesh of the sonne of man as meate that shall tary with vs to euerlasting life. But his father gaue him to the world, not only in faith and spirite, but in reall and substantiall flesh. Therfore God the sonne by drift of his talke doth signifie, that he will giue in his supper, wherof he speaketh, not in spirite and faith only, but in truth of nature and substance, the selfe same reall and substantiall flesh. O what sporte would such an argumente make among the Sophisters in Cambridge and Oxford: In which be so many tearmes and neuer a meane, so many false propositions, so many petitions of principles, so much more in the conclusion, then was in the premisses, finally so many words, and so litle to ye purpose. But I will make answere briefely and plainly. The equally of Christ with his father, prooueth in deed that he is able to doe whatsoeuer it pleaseth him, and to performe whatsoeuer he promiseth. But he no where in his Chapter promiseth to giue his reall &amp; substantiall flesh to be eaten bodily: therefore his almighty power prooueth nothing of that purpose. But he promiseth to giue vs the same true flesh, which he receiued of his father to

be meate tarying vnto eternal life. This promise he perfourmeth daiely vnto the electe, making his bodye and bloud which was crucified and shedde for vs, to be food of euerlasting continuance. Yea (saith Sander) but God gaue him to the world, not only in faith and spirite, but in trueth of nature and substance: therefore Christ will giue vs his reall flesh in substance not in faith and spirite onely. A strange argument, God gaue Christ to ye world in the true nature and substance of fleshe, not in spirite and faith only. What mean you by this: God gaue him not in spirite and faith onely? For any thing that I vnderstande of your meaning, God gaue him not in faith &amp; spirite at all. For when you speak of Christs incarnation, and of God sending him in the flesh, what sense is it to say, he sent him in faith or in spirit? But God gaue him naturall flesh, and God gaue him to the world manifested in the flesh. But howe doth the worlde receiue him being giuen in reall and substantiall flesh? How did all the Patriarkes, Prophetes, and elect before the time of his incarnation receiue him, who being giuen to the world, must needes be giuen to them also? Verily no otherwise, then in spirite and by faith. Euen so Christ promising to giue his flesh and his bloud to be meate &amp; drinke vnto vs, meaneth not, that it should otherwise be receiued then in spirite and by faith, either in his supper or in baptisme, or without any of the Sacraments. And heerevnto the diuine power of Christ serueth to assure our faith, that he can giue vs his very naturall and diuine flesh, to be receiued spiritually, and faithfully, to feede and nourish vs vnto life euerlasting assuredly.
               
               
                  CAP. VIII.
                  
                     Seeing Christ is the bread of life to vs by the gift of his Sander. flesh, the eating of that flesh by our faith and spirite sufficeth not, but it selfe also must be really eaten.
                  
                  
                     
It is marueile, why it should not suffice vs to eate hi
                        •
                      flesh, which is the breade of life, as all the children of Fulke. God did eate it before his incarnation, and as many thousandes since, which haue beene partakers of eternall life, and yet neuer were admitted to the Lordes supper. But Sander sayeth, it is expressely against the worde of God, that by the incarnation of Christ, wee haue not the breade of life giuen vs by any other way then wee had it before. The reason belike is this: That the bread of life is nowe first promised by the gift of Christ, as who came into the worlde to bring vs this euerlasting meate. Marke this Popish diuinitie which restraineth the vertue of Christes incarnation to the instant &amp; time, in which he tooke flesh, and thereby denyeth eternall life to all the Patriarches and Prophets, who by his reason neuer tasted of the bread of life. He talketh much, and to litle or no purpose of the controuersie, that the godhead is life properly, which that it might be communicated to vs, it assumpted flesh, and this flesh is made meate for vs, but what is the conclusion? It is giuen at Christes supper, vnder the forme of breade, no other meane of giuing will serue. Doeth he not by this conclusion exclude all them from eternall life, which haue not beene admitted to the Sacrament? and yet like a folish hypocrite, he cryeth out of our crueltie, which depriuing men of the true flesh of Christ, depriue them of the godhead and of eternall life. Whereas he slandereth vs altogether: for we affirme, that euery one of Gods elect from the beginning of the world, hath beene fedde truely with the verie naturall flesh of Christ, but spiritually receiued, and by other meanes then vnder ye forme of breade in the supper, namely by faith, and in other Sacraments in them that were of discretion, and might come to them, and euen without faith and without Sacraments (in such of Gods elect, as lacking age were preuented by death, before they could be partakers of sacraments) by the onely working of Gods holy spirite, who no lesse worketh in this wonderfull spiritual nourishment, then in any spirituall regeneration.
                  
                     
And therefore Sander reasoneth like a grosse Philosopher, when he sayth: that no signe is able to comiey that heauenly bread to vs. It is horrible blasphemie to say, that my faith is able to deriue the substance of God, as meate into my soule and bodie, seeing faith is but a creature onely, wherein the fulnesse of Godhead dwelleth not, and therefore is not able to attaine to the vnion of Gods nature, and much lesse able to giue it mee. And yet for all this that Sander sayeth, the Apostle prayeth that Christ, in whome the fulnesse of the godhead dwelleth corporally, may dwell in our heartes by faith. In deede, not by the worthinesse of faith, but by the grace of the holy spirite, who giueth strength to the weake elements of the worlde, and to our vnperfect faith, to bring to passe wonderfull effects, as we may see in baptisme. Wherefore, to reason of the weakenesse of signes, and vnablenesse of faith, seuerally from the spirite of God, is as much, as if you would go about to proue, that because a mans body without his soule can do nothing, therefore, being vnited to his soule, it is not of force to do any thing. To prooue that wee cannot be partakers of the Godhead of Christ without his flesh, he alleageth Cyrillus and Augustine, whose authorities, it is needeles to repeate, seeing wee grant as much as he would haue to be proued by them. But beside them, he citeth Hilarius 
                        
                           lib. 8. de Trinit. Si verè verbum, &amp;c. If the worde be truely made flesh, and in our Lordes meate, wee truely receiue the worde made flesh, howe can it bee but hee must be iudged to dwell naturally in vs? Hereof, he gathereth that wee receiue Christ into our bodies after a carnall manner of receiuing, which is farre from Hilaries meaning, although he vse the worde naturally, which euen Sander must confesse to be vnproperly vsed, or else hee shall admitte many vnnaturall conclusions. Wherefore by naturally, he meaneth properly, verily, and truely, yet after a diuine and spirituall manner, not after a grosse, naturall, and sensible manner of habitation.
                  Againe, this dwelling of Christ in vs naturally, doeth not prooue, that hee is corporally receiued into our mouthes, and settled in our stomakes. But this is

sufficient to prooue, that he meaneth Christ to be spiritually receiued, in that hee affirmeth, it is not possible but that he must dwell naturally in them that receiue his flesh in the Lordes meate. Sander addeth, worthily: But Hilarie sayeth, truely. Therefore whosoeuer truely receiueth the flesh of Christ in the meate of our Lord, Christ must needes dwell in him naturally: but Christ dwelleth not at all in the vngodly, therefore the vngodly receiue not his fleshe in the Lordes meate, as the Papistes say, in whome also hee shoulde dwell naturally, if hee were receiued truly, or as they say, corporally.
               
               
                  CAP. IX.
                  
                     By the three diuerse giuings, which are named in Saint Iohn, Sander it is shewed, that Christ giueth his reall flesh vnder the figure of another thing.
                  
                  The three times of giuing, doe not prooue that three 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . diuerse things are giuen (neither doeth Sander saye one worde to prooue that they doe) and where is then the grounde of this disputation? God by Moyses (sayeth Sander) is sayde to haue giuen in time past, he hath giuen them breade from heauen to eate. But Christ sayeth, Moyses gaue you not breade from heauen, but my Father giueth you the true bread from heauen: Euen he which gaue them Manna for a Sacrament of the true breade, euen he gaue then, giueth nowe, and shall giue for euer the true breade from heauen, which is the fleshe of our Sauiour Christe incarnate, crucified, reuiued, and ascended into heauen for our saluation. And howe can Sander prooue, that Christ saying, hee will giue his flesh, meaneth any other gift then God his father did alwayes giue, except he referre his giuing to the time of his passion, the fruite whereof was and is giuen vnto the ende of the worlde. That the breade which Christ giueth, is true vnder a figure, that is the forme of bread, fulfilling the figure of Manna, is a dreame of Sanders owne

head, for Christ speaketh not of any giuing vnder a figure or forme of breade, or of giuing the bread of his supper, but of the generall foode of eternall life, which it is necessarie that al they be partakers of, which shalbe partakers of eternall life. And therefore it is out of measure absurd, that Sander would proue his figuratiue forme by Irenaeus, which saieth, that the Eucharistie consisteth of two things, of one earthly, which is the forme of bread and wine, the other heauenly &amp;c: Irenaeus saith, not yt the formes of bread and wine are the earthly part of the Sacrament, but bread and wine in deede, for those externall formes or accidents, bee not any earthly thing, which is a substantiall matter. Irenaeus saieth, of the bread and wine, our bodies are increased and nourished: so can they not be of Sanders Accidents lib. 5. But hee will shewe the absurdities that rise of the Sacramentaries opinion. If Christes gift (saieth he) consisted of the substance of breade sanctified in qualitie, and made a signe of his body (as the sacramentaries teach) it shoulde neither bee the true bread, which his father gaue him, nor better then Manna, &amp;c: But where doe the Sacramentaries teach, that Christes gifte spoken of in this Chapter is the substance of bread sanctified in qualitie &amp;c. Wee teach that Christs gifte is his owne naturall bodie and bloude giuen in his passion to all the faithfull of the worlde, to bee the foode of eternall life, as for the substance of bread giuen in his last supper, wee teach that it is a Sacrament and seale of this gift. Therfore he must seeke other Sacramentaries to fight against, if any such be. For wee teach the true doctrine of the Sacraments, according to the worde of God, making difference as all Christian diuines haue done before vs, of the sacrament and the matter of the sacrament.

                     By the shadow of the law past, and by the naked trueth to come Sander. in heauen, it is perceiued that the middle state of the newe Testament requireth the real presence of Christs bodie vnder the forme of breade.
                  
                  
                     
He groundeth vpon the 10. to the Hebrews: The Law F
                           •
                        lke. hath the shadowe of good things to come, and not the verie image of things: applying the shadowe to the Lawe, the image to the gospel, and the things themselues to the life to come. In which application, he seeth not howe he graunteth to the Gospel, but an image of things, and not the thinges themselues, and thereby in deede, denieth the verie flesh of Christ to be giuen vs, but an image thereof, For his glosse will not stande with the Apostles wordes, that we haue the verie flesh of Christ vnder the image o
                        •
                      forme of bread, the Apostle saying, we haue the image of things: which image if it be none other, but the accidents of breade, wee haue no great prerogatiue aboue the Law. In deede the Apostle meaneth, that the same things which were but rudely shadowed, as it wer with a cole, to the fathers in the Law, are in a liuely image described, and set forth vnto vs in the Gospel. For the Gospel hath not those good thinges which are to come, but possesseth them by faith. Therefore how foolish is that conclusion of Sander, vppon this text? Christ gaue vs his real flesh vnder the forme of breade, or else he gaue not the thing it selfe: and if hee gaue it without figure, out state were not an image of the things themselues. Wheras the Apostle speaketh not of these things which are giuen, but of the clearenes of the doctrine, of those things which are promised: and therefore he calleth them good things to come, and Christ an high Priest of good things to come. As madde, yea and more frantike is that conclusion, that Christ cannot be a mediator betweene the two Testaments, except he gaue his flesh vnder the forme and figure of breade. By which drunken conclusion, it should follow, that Christs mediation depended vpon the institution of the Sacrament, which the Apostle in expresse words doth affirme to haue bene made complet in his death, which was effectuall vnto all ages alike. Heb. 9. Also that Christ in Baptisme, hath not shewed himselfe to be a mediator greater then Moses, because he hath not therein giuen vs his naturall flesh, which is in heauen: And last of all, that Christ is not a mediator vnto the fathers

that liued before the institution of his supper, but onely to them that are partakers of his flesh in the supper. Againe, as vntrue it is, that because Christ came to fulfill the Law, therfore it was necessarie, that he should giue his flesh vnder a figure: which flesh was not giuen to them that liued vnder the Lawe: as though there were one meane of saluation for them, and another for vs.
                  The scripture doth often distinguish the Law, and the Gospel, shewing what is peculiar to either of them, but it neuer affirmeth, that the persons liuing in the time of the strength of Moses Lawe, were saued otherwise then by the Gospel, that is by remission of sinnes, through faith in ye mercie of God reconciled to vs by Iesus Christ. Therefore it is more then blockish, to wrest the distinction of the Testamēts, to make a difference of the saluation of the persons. Seing the new Testament was not first ordeined (as Sander seemeth to say) when Christ did institute his supper, which hee called the new Testament, but euen from the beginning of the world, but yet to take effect, vertue and strength, by the death of Christ, of which Testament, the supper is a sacrament, bearing the name of the thing whereof it is a Sacrament, as well when it is called the newe Testament, as when it is called the bodie and bloude of Christ. And therefore the example of the precept, of not killing, expounded by Christ to extend to anger, proueth not any newe trueth to be added by the Gospel, but the ancient right meaning of the cōmandement, deliuered from the glosse of the Pharisees, which expounded the precept, onely of murthering with the hand. For who will say that such anger as Christ forbiddeth, was lawfull before the time he made that exposition; or that to commit adulterie in heart, by lusting after a woman, was not sinne, before Christ did so interpret that commaundement. If it were sinne, then it was a breach of the Law: if it were a breach of the Lawe, it was of the Lawe that was giuen: therefore the Lawe was alwayes spirituall, and had that true meaning, and was so taken of all good men, before Christ reprooued the corruption of the Pharisaical glosses. That

all legall instruction, and propheticall figures, are transferred into the sacraments of Christ, as Leo saith, we agre. We denie not, that which Dionyse saieth, although wee may not acknowledge him to haue beene S. Pauls scholler: that our holy gouernement partaketh of heauen, spirituall contemplation, and of the Lawe sensible signes. Neither of both these autorities proue ye matter in question. As for the distinction of gifts, whervnto Sand. tumbleth againe, in the end of this chapter, we make not voyd by our figuratiue doctrine. But such distinction as was in deede, betweene that which Moses gaue, and God gaue, we vpholde by our figuratiue doctrine, which sheweth y• right difference betweene the auctor and ye minister, the signe &amp; the thing signified. But yt distinction betwene ye gift which ye Father gaue alwayes, and yt which the sonne promiseth to giue to be diuerse, whē Sander cā proue, we may be brought to acknowledge it: In the meane time, yt promise of continuance of that gift, in the Future temps, which Christ hath alwayes giuen, is a slender argument to proue the distinction of gifts imagined by Sander.
                  Finally in substance of the foode of eternal life, as we differ not in the life eternall it selfe, we are not preferred before ye lewes. They did all eat the same spiritual meate &amp;c: Our prefermente is more cleere sight and vnderstanding, euen such difference as is between the knowledge, obteined by a description of a bodie shadowed, and liuely set foorth in colours, which is the shadow and verie image that the Apostle speaketh of. Heb. 10.
               
               
                  CAP. XI.
                  
                     The bread that Christ promiseth to giue which is his flesh, must needs be meant of the substance of his flesh. Sander.
                     
                  
                  There is no doubt but Christ did giue the substance Fulke. of his flesh, which being crucified for vs, is made ye bread of life and spirituall meate and drinke to be receiued of vs, not after any corporall manner of eating, but by faith in spirit, not onely in the Sacrament of his supper, but in

baptisme also, and without any sacrament. But that it must stand for a trueth vniuersally receiued, that Christ saying, The breade which I will giue is my flesh, meant ye bread which I wil giue you at my last supper, that I say I denie. What Sander vaunteth he hath proued thereof, in the 5. and 6. chapters of this booke, let it bee examined with mine answere. But admit he had spoken principally of his supper, yet doeth it not followe, which Sander doth inferre, that he promised to giue his flesh to Iudas because he was one of the twelue which taryed with him at Capernaum, for his promise in offer, was as large to all that departed, and to the world, for the life whereof he promised to giue his flesh, therefore it cannot be concluded that it was not onely a spirituall gift that was promised but an externall gift deliuered by hand, which Iudas might receiue. For Christ promiseth such a gift, as if it be receiued, worketh eternall life in the receiuers.
                  Finally, it cannot be prooued, that Iudas was prsēt at the supper, who departed about his treason, before the institution of the sacrament, as appeareth by saint Iohn immediatly after the soppe receiued, wherevnto some of the ancient writers also do consent. Furthermore, yt the gift of Christ doth differ from ye gift of his father in person and time, and therfore cannot be giuen by faith only, it is no good consequent. For God gaue his sonne for the worlde, and Christ gaue himselfe for vs, yet but one gift. The difference of time, I haue often answered. As for the obiection, yt he faineth the Sacramentaries must say, that that flesh heere stādeth for the signe or figure of his flesh, is of his owne making, for as I said before, we vnderstand the flesh of Christ giuen for the life of the world, his naturall body, crucified for vs, and not the sacrament of his body giuen in his last supper.
               
               
                  CAP. XII.
                  
                     A further declaration of the reall presence of Christes body and Sander. bloud, taken out of the discourse of his owne wordes concerning the different eating of him by faith, and the receiuing of

his flesh and bloud in the Sacrament of the Altar.
                  
                  First he repeteth his three gifts. God gaue by Moses, Fulke. naked figures, as Manna: God giueth presently, the flesh of Christ to our eyes and heartes: and Christ will giue hereafter the same flesh, vnder the forme of breade. Of these giftes he maketh three diuerse workes: the first by teeth and belly, the seconde by faith and spirite, and the thirde by both. The gift of Christ differing from Manna, is expressed in the Chapter. But any difference of the gift of the father, and of the sonne, there is not expressed, nor to be gathered by any note of distinction or dissentanie argument. Yet Sander hath founde out a great number of differences, to prooue that although the Father and the Sonne giue one thing, that is the flesh of Christ, yet not one way to be receiued, the Father giueth it to bee receiued by faith onely, the Sonne to be receiued corporally.
                  The first difference is, of the time, The Father doeth giue in the Present tense, the Sonne will giue in the Future tense. This I haue often answered to be no differēte, for Christ saith in ye presēt temps, except ye do eat ye flesh: &amp;c. ergo he did presently giue it. Againe, he that doth eat often, is oftē times repeted, in ye present time, and my flesh is meate in deede: all which prooue that Christs gift, was present when he spake to be receiued, therefore it differeth not from the Fathers gift, and way of receiuing the same.
                  The second difference: the Father giueth Christ in the forme of man, by the manner of the Fathers gift, the faithfull may see yt sonne of Man, vpon whom they beleeue: as it is saide, This is the will of my Father which sent me, that euery one who seeth the Sonne, and beleeueth in him, may haue euerlasting life. And againe: yee haue seene me, and haue not beleeued. Of the Sonnes gift it is not saide, that his flesh shalbe seene, but rather insinuated, that it shalbe vnder the couering of another kinde of foode. I answere, that Christ in neither of both these sayings, speaketh of the corporall sight of his body.

But in the one which is first placed in S. Iohn, Yee 
                        〈◊〉
                      au: seene me, and not beleeued; he exprobrateth to the Iewes their wilfull blindnesse, which had acknowledged him before to be ye Messias, when he fed their bellyes, &amp; now refuse to beleeue him, when hee offereth to feede their soules. In the other place, he sheweth, yt obediēce of faith ioyned to a manifest acknowledging of Christ, by the wil of God, is the way to eternal life. For if seing, should be taken for bodily seeing of Christes flesh, it could not extende to vs which cannot bodilie behold him. Againe, this difference ouerthroweth Sanders supposed way of the fathers giuing, which is by faith and spirit onely &amp; not sensibly to the eye of the bodie. Last of all, it is a weake argument, it is not saide in this or that text: ergo it is not meant, or it is not true at all.
                  The 3. difference: The Fathers gifte is called the true bread from heauen: The Sonnes gift is called, not onely true breade, but also truely breade and meate in deede. Some true meate may chaunce not to bee truely meat, bec
                        ••
                     se it is not eaten: but nothing is meate in deede, and truelye meate, except it bee in deede eaten. If this difference bee woorth a strawe, then your consecrated hostes bee not the Sonnes gift, before they bee eaten: and except they bee eaten (as some time yee wo
                        ••
                      well they are burned) they bee not his gifte at all; if not his gift, then not flesh and bloude. The difference of a true Vine, and a Vine truelie, is sufficiently discussed in the later ende of the fourth booke answered by master Nowel. Sander cannot or will not consider ye difference of the opposition betweene truely and falsely, and truely and properly.
                  The fourth difference: The Iewes and disciples, went not away from Christe, for any thing, that was spoken about the Fathers gifte, thinking that a gifte of eating by faith, might stande with the custome of Gods people, but in the Sonnes gift, they sawe more apparant absurdity, not lacking vnderstanding, but faith, and therefore departed. I answere, they lacked

vnderstanding, as much as faith, and therefore Augustin
                        •
                      saith: 
                        Sed qui aderant plures, non intelligendo s
                              •
                           andaliazti sunt: non erum cogitabant haec audiendo nisi carnem, quod ipsi erant. But manie of them that were present, were offended for lacke of vnderstanding: For heating these thinges, they thought on nothing but fleshe, which they themselues were. It is a simple difference, that is gathered of ye Iewes ignorance and incredulitie.
                  The 5. difference, The gift of the father is called by such names only, as belong to the persō of Christ, or to his diuine nature to say, the bread of life, the liuely bread, the true bread (for God onely is absolutelie the true bread of life) or by the Pronoune I: The gift of Christ is called also by the names of his humane nature, to wit, the flesh and bloud of the sonne of men. If this differēce proue any thing, it prooueth not the diuerse wayes of giuing the same thing, but that the same thing is not giuen by the Father and the Sonne: Where as Sander saide before, that the Father giueth Christ in humane nature, to the worlde. If the humane nature of Christ bee giuen of the father, the names thereof may well agree to the Fathers gift.
                  The 6 difference, That Christ endeth his talke of eche gif
                           •
                        , with repeting the old figure Manna, betokening by both, the shadowe of Manna to be fulfilled. But Manna was more perfectly fulfilled in outward doings by the sonnes gift. This is an agreement rather then a difference, except in the last illation, which is a meere begging of the matter in question. But there is a great difference, in that it is said of the one, If any man eate, ex hoc pane of this breade; in the other, he that eateth hunc panem this breade: and heere is made a great difference, betweene eating of Christ, and eating Christ himselfe: the one is onely by faith, the other in the Sacrament of the Altar, the one is to bee partaker of the vertue and grace of Christ, the other to receiue the substance of Christ. &amp;c. But our sauiour Christ in S. Iohn confoundeth this difference, vsing the Accusatiue case and the Ablatiue: with the preposition, for all one. I am the liuing bread, which came downe from heauen, if any man shall eate of this bread, he shall liue for

euer: Here is the Ablatiue with a preposition, but what is this bread, of which he that eateth shal, liue? he answereth: The bread which I wil giue, is my flesh, whereof he saith afterward, Except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c: where he vseth the Accusatiue: by which it is plaine, that with Christ, to eat this breade, &amp; to eat of this bread, is all one. Saint Paul also ouerthroweth this difference, shewing that the Israelites did drink of ye spiritual Rock, which was Christ, vnworthily, where as none can receiue the effect of Christes death vnworthily. So he saith wee are al partakers of one bread. But Sand, not satisfied, asketh if this be ye end of our long disputatiō, yt Christ came into the world to giue a lesse token, then God had giuen before, vnder Moses &amp;c? as though Christ came into the world for no end but to giue ye sacrament. As for so many differences as he dreameth of his fathers gift, and his, we finde not any one, but that they may all agree in one gift, which was not his supper, but himselfe to death, for the life of ye world, wherof euery one of his elect is made partaker, as of spiritual foode, by faith &amp; his holy spirit.
                  But this difference is learned, saith he, out of Chrysostome, vpon Iohn. Ho. 45. &amp;c. where he noteth first the diuersitie of persons, saying: Se, non patrem, that he, not his father dare to giue (saith Sander) but he falsifieth Chrysostome, which saith dedisse, to haue giuen, which proueth that it is not giuen onely in the Sacrament, which then was not instituted. 2 That hee saith, Hom. 44. that Christ speaketh first of his diuinitie, and about the ende, of his bodie, prooueth not that he speaketh onely of the Sacrament: For Hom. 45. he saith plainely, as Sander confesseth, that ye bread signifieth either the doctrine of Christ, and saluation, and faith in him, or else his body. Wherin hee dissenteth altogether from Sanders interpretation, who will not haue the bodie of Christ promised before flesh be named.
                  But Chrysostome saith vpon these wordes: my flesh is meat in deed: &amp;c. that he so saide, to the end they should not thinke him to speake in parables; but by fleshe, to meane the signe of flesh, or by eating, to meane be leeuing

is to speake in parables. I answere, that wee say neither of both: but that Christ is verily eaten by faith, and by the spirite of God: yet Sander omitteth the other cause which Chrysostome rendreth of his so saying: A
                           ••
                         quòd is est verus cibus, &amp;c. either that hee is the true meate which saueth the soule, or else &amp;c. But he saueth not the soule onely by eating the Sacrament: therefore this meate is not eaten onely in the sacrament.
                  Finally that which is noted out of Hom. 83. in Matth. that Christ is ioyned vnto vs, not by faith and loue onely, but in verie deede: Wee confesse, but so is hee ioyned to infants that neuer receiued the supper, and so was hee ioyned to all the faithfull before his incarnation, in as much as they all were members of his bodie. And so confesseth Chrysostome, in Ioan. Homil. 46. that Abraham by eating and drinking the flesh and bloud of Christ, shall bee partaker of the resurrection, and therefore Christ saide, He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, hath life eternall and I will raise him vp in the last day. The testimonies of Theophilact, and Euthynius which are but late writers in comparison, I will not stande vpon.
               
               
                  CAP. XIII.
                  
                     The like precept made to men of lawfull age for eating Chris
                           ••
                         flesh, as was made generally for baptisme, sheweth his flesh to be Sander as really present in his supper, as water is in baptisme.
                  
                  Neither the one precept of regeneration is principally of baptisme, neither the other of the Lordes supper. Fulk. And the necessitie of eating and drinking the flesh and bloud of Christ, is not 
                        •
                     aide onely vpon men of lawfull age, because they were of lawfull age to whome Christe spake, any more then the necessitie of regeneration vppon all men, seeing Nicodemus, to whome Christe saide, Except a man be borne &amp;c. was of lawful age. For spiritual food, which is nothing else but ye body &amp; bloud of Christ, is as necessarie for al ages, as for perfect age. But that the flesh of Christ is as necessarie in the supper

to feede vs, as water in Baptisme to wash vs, it is a froward and foolish comparisō: for water washeth not our soules, nor regenerateth vs, but the holy ghost, whereof water is a signe: so the flesh of Christ is as necessarie in the supper to feede vs, as the holy ghost, to wash vs and regenerate vs, which seeing it doth without transubstantiation of the water into the spirite, likewise doth the flesh and bloud of Christ nourish vs, without transubstantiation of the outward signes into them. The right Analogie is betweene water, and breade, and wine, and betweene the spirite of God, and the flesh and bloud of Christ, not betweene outward water &amp; spirituall flesh of Christ, which is as preposterous a comparison, is if you would compare the holy ghost in baptisme, with the breade and wine in the sacrament. But of the error of Cyprian, Innocentius, and Augustine, he will prooue, the necessitie of the presence of Christs flesh in the supper, because they gaue the communion to infantes, yt coulde not receiue it with faith &amp; vnderstanding: therfore they thought ye very body &amp; blod of Christ to be really cōtained in ye sacramēt. I answere it was not because they thought so, but because they thought ye one sacrament as necessarie as the other, which might, and may in deede be ministred to infants, yt haue not faith nor vnderstanding actually. Therfore that they ministred the communiō to infants, it shewed their error proceeding of ignorance, as all error doth: but it sheweth not, yt they thought ye one sacrament to be other wise then the other, a seale or assurance of iustification, wtout any dreame of transubstantiatiō. That Sand would excuse their custom to haue bin vsed more for a security, then for necessitie, is to no purpose. It is manifest yt they thought erroniously, yt the eternall signe or seale was necessary in both, as Aug. &amp; Innocent. B. of Rome hath defined, denying eternall life to infants yt dyed without the communion and baptisme, as though the grace of God had bene necessarily tyed to the outward elements.
               
               
                  CAP. XIIII.
                  
                     That S. Augustine did not teach th

flesh &amp;c: To betoken the eating of Christonely by faith and spirit, nor yet the eating of materiall bread with faithfull remembrance of him, but the eating of his flesh, to the end we may be the better ioyned to the spirit of God.
                  
                  There is no better way to be ioyned to the spirit of Fulk. god, thē by eating ye flesh of Christ spiritually, which Aug. doth teach, not ye carnall manner of eating which Sander doth defend. S. Aug. de doct. Christ lib. 3. ca 16. as Sander doth confesse, affirmeth yt this speech of Christ, Except yee eat yt flesh &amp;c: containeth a figure. And what the meaning of this figure is, August. telleth vs: It is a figure (saith he) commanding, that we should communicate with the passion of our Lord, and that we should sweetely and profitably remēber, that his flesh was crucisied and wounded for vs. But Sander replyeth, first against ye Lutherans, yt August. calling this speach a figure, meaneth not to deny yt it appertaineth to the last supper. And which of the Lutherans I pray you, denyed, that it appertaineth to the last supper, although they deny yt it is singularly spoken of the last supper? Secondly he fathereth vpon ye Zwinglians an vntruth, that they graunt the place to be vnderstoode of Christs last supper, to prooue ye necessitie of both kinds, which is a fable: for they graunt none otherwise, then I haue often shewed, &amp; yet a good argument for necessitie of both kinds may be taken out of yt place, because Christ giueth vs a perfect nourishmēt of meat and drinke, or as Iustine saith, of d
                        •
                     ie and moyst nourishment, vnto which spirituall trueth, the externall seale must be made consormable. But nowe, will Sander teach vs to vnderstande, what S. Augustine meaneth by a figuratiue speach, which is al one as if he would teach vs to go to supper, as it is in the Greeke prouerbe. First a siguratiue speach must not denie any word in the speach, to be vsed vnproperly, but is measured by faith and good manners. Whereas Augustine telleth vs, that if in any sentence of the scripture, the words sound against faith, &amp; good manners, the words must not be taken in their proper sense, but they are a figure, and signifie some other thing, then the words in their proper taking do sound, as

diuerse examples which he bringeth in the same place, beside his plaine wordes, do declare. This saying hee affirmeth to be a figuratiue speache, Thou shalt heape burning coales on his head, which he doeth thus interprete: 
                        Vt intelligas carbones ignis, esse vrentes poenitentiae gemitus, quibus superbia sanatur eius, qui dolet se inimicum fuisse hominis, a quo eius miseriae subvenitur: That thou m

Beholde, euen as coales of fire in this text, are not taken in their proper sense, for a bodily substance of woodde incensed: so is not eating and drinking in ye other sentence, taken in the proper sense, for receiuing at our mouth, chawing and swallowing, But as Augustine interpreteth, for communicating with the flesh of Christ by faith and spirite, &amp;c. either in the Sacrament, or without it. And it is a foolish cauil of Sander, to say that charitie is not broken, when we eate Christ whole vnder the forme of breade, without hurting of him, &amp;c. For Augustine counteth it slagitium, an heynous offence, to eate the fleshe of man in proper sense of eating, that is corporally: Yea, faith Sander, to eate it in peeces, as it is solde in tho shambles. As though to eate an whole man after that maner, were not more monstrous, then to eate a piece of him. But Sander to shewe his synceritie, rehearseth a large place out of Augustine in Psal. 98. which, howe cunningly he can wrest for his purpose you shall see. 
                        Durum illis visum est &amp;c. It seemed an hard thing to the Iewes: except a man eate my flesh, he shall not haue life euerlasting. They tooke it foolishly, they thought of it carnally, and supposed that our Lord minded to cutte of certeine small peeces of his body, and to giue them. This is an hard talk, say they. They were harde, &amp; not the talke. For if they were not hard but gentle, they would say to them selues: He speaketh not this thing rashly, but because ther lieth priuie som sacrament being gentle &amp; not hard they wold tati wt him, &amp; shal learn of him yt thing which

after their departure, those learned who taried. For when the twelue had taried with him (the other beeing departed) they (as who were sory for ye others departing) warned Christ that they were offended with his word, &amp; so were departed. But Christ instructed them and saied: it is the spirite that quickneth, the flesh profiteth not, the wordes which I haue spoken to you, are spirite and life. Vnderstand yt which I haue spokēspiritually. Ye shal not eate this body which you see, wee shall not drinke that bloud which they shall shedde, who will crucifie me: I haue commended to you a certeine Sacrament, which being spiritually vnderstoode, shall make you liue. And although that Sacrament must needes be visiblye celebrated, yet it must be inuisibly vnderstanded. Three thinges Sander noteth out of this sayinge: First against the Lutherans, that Augustine vnderstandeth the precept of eating Christes flesh of the Sacrament. I answere, that Augustine in other places, and namely in his purposed commentary of that place, vnderstandeth it not to be singularly spoken of the eating in the Sacrament, but otherwise also: which is all that wee affirme and denie of referring this place to the Sacrament. Secondly he no teth against the Zwinglians, that the figuratiue speach which Augustine saieth to be in these wordes, is to be meant of the manner of eating, in the natural vnderstanding of c

                     all men, by cutting, tearing, chawing, &amp;c. not denying the substance of his flesh whole, sound, and quicke, to be eaten vnder the forme of breade. I answere the naturall vnderstanding of carnall men is by eating to receiue in at the mouth that which is eaten &amp;c. wherfore Augustine denieth that also. Thirdly he noteth that he calleth it Sacrament which in his booke de doct. Christ, he called a figure, taking the name of a figure for a holy signe of an higher trueth. This is a grosle and shameles collection, for he calleth the wordes of Christ a figure, and a figuratiue and vnproper speache, which must not be taken according to the sound of the words: 
                        S

                           . If it sound this properly, then let it be takē for no figuratiue spech.
                     
By which words you see that a figuratiue spech is an vnproper speach. But how can this snake slide away from those wordes of Augustine? You shall not eate that body which you see, nor drinke that bloud which they shall shedde, I commend vnto you a Sacrament. Therefore y• Sacrament is not his body which then was seen, nor his bloud which afterward was shedde. But Sander gliding ouer these wordes, as though he sawe them not, presuming vpon the credulity of Papistes, which must beleue that they make nothing against the carnall manner of presence, if he say so: he passeth to another saying of Augustine in Ioan. Tr. 26. &amp;. 27. to proue that the error of the lewes was not concerning the substance of ye flesh that must be eaten really, but concerning ye manner of eating of it. Because Augustine saith carnem intellexerune quomodo, &amp;c. They vnderstoode flesh, so as it is torne in a carcase, or sold in the shambles, and not as it is quickned with ye spirite of God. I answer, this was one of their errors, but not all. For Augustine in Ps. 98. bringeth in Christ, denying them his naturall body and bloud: ergo they erred in the substance as well as in the manner: &amp; in Ioan Tr. 24. he saith: 
                        Illi putabant eum erogaturum corpus suum, ille aut em dixit se ascensurum in coelum vtique integrum. Cùm videritis fiüum hominis ascendentem vbi erat prius, certè vel tunc videbitis, quia non eo modo quo putatis, errogas corpus suum, vel tunc intelligetis quia gratia eius non consumitur morsibus. They thought, that he would giue out his body, but he said, that be would ascende into heauen whole. When you shal see ye sonne of mā ascending wher he was before, certeinly euen then at lest you shall see, that he giueth not out his body after that manner you thinke, euen then at lest you shall vnderstand, that his grace is not consumed with bitinges. In these wordes, the argument of his ascension, taketh away all corporal presence as wel of Christ whole, as broken in peeces, secondly the exposition of his grace not consumed wt byting, sheweth after what manner he vnderstandeth his body to be present, namely by spirituall grace, not by corporall substance. Therefore all Sanders iangling of signes and

figures, is to no purpose. For when he hath prated what he can, a signe shall neuer be the thing which it signifieth; nor a figure the same thing that it figureth, except opposites may agree to one thing at one time, and in one respect.
                  For to vse his owne foolish example, a loafe of bread, which a baker setteth out, to signifie that bread is there to bee folde, although it be of that kinde of breade, which it signifieth to be in ye house in greater quantity, yet it is not that same bread, wherof it is the signe. No more is the Sacrament, that same thing, whereof it is a signe, and yet an assured testimonie that the thing signified is giuen to our soules and faith, as certeinely as the signe to our bodies. But because Augustine saith, except ye eate my flesh, are wordes figuratiue. Sander will reason thus: as cunningly I warrant you, as any collier in Cambridge or Oxford. The eating of Christs flesh and drinking of his bloud, being reall deades which must be performed in Christes supper, and yet being called for good respect figurat

                        e wordes, must needes be figures of somwhat, and the deedes and wordes being referred to the supper, must needs betoken somwhat, as they are considered. But the eating of the flesh in Christs supper, can betoken nothing at all, except his flesh be there eaten▪ the eating whereof maie be the grounde of this betokening. Therefore these wordes import of necessitie, that in Christes supper the flesh of Christ is really eaten, and his blood is really dr

                         bread, &amp;c.
                  
                  O what whistling and hissing would be in the Sophisters schooles, if such an argument came among them, which reasoneth ioyntly of things to be deuided! Augustine saith the words are figuratiue, &amp; not the deeds of eating &amp; drinking, which are signified by the words, Except ye eate, &amp;c.
                  The wordes I saye, of eating and drinking of the flesh and bloud of Christ, are figuratiue, betokening another thing then they sound in common and proper

vnderstanding; and what they signifie, he sheweth, the communication with the passion of Christ, and profitable remembrance of his death, which as they are represented in the supper, so may we eate and drinke his flesh and bloud without the Sacrament, by faith and working of Gods spirite. But (saith Sander) if the eating of Christes flesh be not the figure, the wordes Except ye eate my flesh, be not figuratiue. Se you not howe this fonde Sophister, confoundeth the distinction which he him selfe before had made of figuratiue speeches and figures of thinges themselues? betweene rhetoricall figures and sacramentall figures. I say the spirituall eating which is the communication, with his passion, &amp;c. is not a figure, but that which is vnderstoode by those figuratiue wordes, except ye eate the flesh, &amp;c.
                  And although there may be a reall eating to warne vs of spirituall eating; yet that spirituall eating which Saint Augustine calleth communicating with the passion of Christ, &amp;c. may be without the Sacrament, and so is Augustine discharged of Sanders Sophistry.
                  But now he will discouer the errors of the Sacramentaries in expounding these wordes: the first is, that they make the wordes of Christ to be figuratiue onely passiuely, whereas they are also figuratiue actiuely. But how I pray you are the wordes figuratiue actiuely? He answereth, the actuall eating of Christes flesh, is not onely said to be figured, but also is taught to be a figure it selfe, of another spirituall eating.
                  If Sander were as ignorant, as his argumentes are absurd, he were the most notable Asse, that euer wrote in diuinity, but I impute it not to ignorance, but to malicious deceitfullnes, that he confoundeth wordes and deedes, and reasoneth thus: the wordes be figuratiue actiuely, because the deede is figuratiue actiuely, which is such a monster, as Sophistry neuer bredde a greater. And what proofe haue you of this actuall eating of Christes flesh, to be a figure actiuely of spirituall eating?

                      1. Cor. Cap. 11. wherein hee chargeth vs with corrupting his wordes, with euil pointing or distincting, which he doth himselfe most manifestly. For vpon these words he writeth:

So often as you shall eate of this breade and drink of this cuppe, you shall shewe the Lordes death vntill he come.) Because (sayth that writer) we are deliuered by the death of our Lorde, we being mindefull of this thing in eating and drinking doe signifie the fleshe and blood which were offered for vs. But Sander readeth, in eating and drinking the fleshe and bloud, wee signifie those things which were offered for vs. Against this wresting by mispointing, first is the relatiue quae, which lacketh an antecedent, if flesh and bloud which was offered for vs, be not signified: Secondly the wordes Carnem &amp; sanguinem are put absolutely, not shewing whose theie are, and the relatiue is referred to vncertain things. For if he had ment the same to be eaten which was offered, he would haue saide not quae but eadem, last of all the accusatiue case following the verbs eating and drinking, can be reasonably none other in an expositor, but the accusatiue case which Paul vseth, that is this breade and this cuppe.
                  The second fowle error of the Sacramentaries, is that they expound the wordes of Christ: Except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, that is to say the figure of his flesh, which is breade and wine. And here he crieth what ignorance? what abusing of Gods word? what blasphemie? where is honestie? where is shamefastnes? where is common vnderstanding? I answere, that for honesty and shamefastnes, it is in the diuel, as soone as in Sander. For what honesty or shamefastnesse is it? thou a

that Christ in that place speaking of his flesh and bloud, spake of a figure thereof. But if no man haue either written or spoken so, thou wilt perhaps inferre it of other sayings or writings of theirs, which say, those words belong to the supper so truely, that they build falsely, vpon them the necessitie of both kindes. But wilt thou not vnderstande by an hundreth times repeating, that none of vs referreth those wordes or any other in that Chapter, vnto the supper, otherwise, then as the supper is a sacrament, seale, or outward token ordeined of Christ to confirme our faith in that doctrine of our spirituall foode, to be giuen by him vnto eternall life, which is giuen to the worthie receiuer in that Sacrament, in baptisme, and without either of them, by the working of Gods spirite onely in some, in men of discretion not without faith? As for the necessitie of both kindes, is proued by that analogie which ought to be betweene the things signified &amp; the signes: and also vpon your owne concession, who vnderstanding those wordes onely of sacramentall eating and drinking, may no more exclude drinking then you can doe eating.
               
               
                  CAP. XV.
                  
                     Christes flesh being meate in deede, must needes be really receiued Sander. into our bodies.
                  
                  Three things (saith Sander) must be considered of him Fulk. that wil knowe, why the flesh of Christ is called meate in deede. The first, that the Iewes asked howe he would giue his flesh to be eaten. The second, that Christ saith, the eating of his flesh was necessarie and profitable, both for bodie and soule. The thirde, that Christ confirmeth these his sayings with this reason. For my flesh is meate in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede: that is, it hath truely and in deed, those properties, that any man would wish for in true meate. But the properties of true meate are, to be receiued into the bodie, and to be a medicine against death. If none be true meate, but that which is receiued into

the body, then that which Sander so often calleth the fathers gift, the bread of life, which came downe from heauen is not true meate, for that he hath often saide, may be receiued by saith and spirit not entring into the body, yet thereof saith Christ, that he is the true bread. But Chrysostome vpon these words, My flesh is meat in deede, &amp;c. saith that it meaneth that flesh to be the true meat, which saueth the soule, or else he speaketh it to confirme them in the former words, that they should not thinke him to haue spoken in parables darkely, but that they shoulde knowe it to bee by all meanes necessarie, to eate his body, in Ioan. Hom. 46. He that granteth both these senses (saith Sander) must needes grant that the true eating of the flesh, standeth not for eating truely the signe of the fleshe, because hee spake not obscurely in parables. Verily he were worthy to weare a cockescombe, that would say true eating of the flesh, standeth for eating truely the signe of the fleshe. Against whome then doeth Sander fight, but against an idoll of his owne braine? but it is an obscure saying to put eating for beleeuing. I answere, Chrysostome speaketh of the meate, and not of the manner of eating: for if there be no obscuritie in the manner of eating, let Sander speake of his small conscience, when he saith the manner of eating to be vnder another kind, then it selfe is, which is most obscure and imperceptible. But if his flesh be called meate, because it must bee eaten bodily, wherefore then is his bloud called drinke in deed, which Sander holdeth not to be necessarie to be dronke bodily? For if his bloud in that sense be drinke in deede, it must be drunke in deede, and not eaten with the bodie. But Augustine, lib. 13. De ciuitate Dei. Cap 
                     
                        •
                     0. sayeth: Tanquam caetera, &amp;c. That other trees of Paradise were a nourishment; the tree of life, a Sacrament: So that the tree of life should be taken to be after such a sort, in the bodily Paradise, as the wisedome of God is in the spirituall intelligible Paradise. Of which wisedome it is written, It is the tree of life, to all that embraece it. What can Sander make of this saying? As corporall tasting in the tree of life, was necessarie for the spirituall effect of incorruption, so Christes flesh

must be corporally tasted that it maie be meate indeede. I denie the comparison, which shoulde be made of the tree with bread, and of life with Christe, and not of woode with the flesh of Christ. And it is certaine, that Augustine not only compareth the sacrament with the sacrament, but also calling Christ, the spirituall part of the sacrament, the wisedome of God, which is a tree of life to all that embrace him, signifieth that Christ is otherwise receiued, then with the mouth: for embracing is more aptly said to be with the armes of faith, then with the lippes of the body, who can not touch the wisedome of God. But Sander once againe to make his matter good, repeateth his ranke and rotten distinction of two giftes, two giuers, two manners of eating, true meate, and meate truely: affirming meate truely to bee because it is receiued in at the mouth, and goeth into the bodie, after such sort, as other meates doe, although it nourish spiritually. Where there is no effect of that he calleth meate truely, but it is by plaine wordes of the Chapter, ascribed to that which is called true meat, which he consesseth may be receiued onely spiritually: euen the vertue of raising vp our bodies: for which cause hee woulde make the bodily eating to be necessarie. He that beleeueth in mee, hath life eternall, and I will raise him vp againe in the last day.
                  Afterwarde, he citeth Hilarie: who presseth the word verè against the Arrians. But yet Sander translateth him falsely. For to make it seeme, that Hilarie spake of such bodily eating as hee doeth, he turneth these words, Haec accepta atque hausta efficiunt: these thinges taken and swallowed: whereas he should say, these things, that is the flesh and bloud of Christ, being taken and drunken, do cause this, that both Christ is in vs, and wee in him, which must needes be taken for eating and drinking spiritually: For eating &amp; drinking his flesh corporally, Sander confesseth to haue no such effect. Howe Christ tarieth in vs naturally, and how we truely vnder a mysterie take the flesh of his bodie, I haue spoken before, and these places of Hilarie are discussed more at large in mine aunswere to Heskins, lib. 2. Cap. 20. &amp; 2
                        •
                     .

by which it may appeare, that Hilary taught no corporall maner of receiuing, but sub sacramento carnis communicandae, vnder a sacrament of his flesh to be communicated, verè, sub mysterio, truly, vnder a mysterie, and so as therebie Christ of necessitie dwelleth in vs and wee in him.

But it is breade prouided for vs without seede, without sowing, without any other worke of man, It flowing from aboue, is founde in the earth for the bread which came downe from heauen, which is the true meate, which is obscurely ment by this Historie of Manna, is not a thing without a bodie. For by what meanes can a thing without a body, be made meate vnto the body? The thing which is not without a body, is by all meanes a bodie. Here (saith Sander) Nyssenus proueth the truth of Christes body, by the truth of the eating thereof, which must be really taken into our bodies, by our mouthes, or else Nyssenus faileth in his whole discourse: which is a shamelesse manifestly. For Gregory saith expressely, we muste take that heauenlie meat with a pure and cleane minde of taking it into our bodies, by the mouth he speaketh not. He gathereth that Christes body is a true body, not because it is bodily eaten, but because it is meate vnto our bodies, which yet as spiritual meate nourisheth spiritually, as Sander confessed euen nowe.

And by these interpretations (saith he) it cannot be auoided, but that the heauenly food which we receiue into our mouthes, is the reall substance of Christs flesh. For it is called benedictio, the blessing, which worde is not meant of an inward vertue, comming from heauen, but of that which seemeth bread, and is visibly receiued. To all this I answere, first, that the termes of mingling, and similitudes of powring waxe &amp; of leauen, must haue a spirituall vnderstanding, or else they will breede monstrous absurdities. And vnto the term

Therefore saith Cyrill, a litle blessing draweth vs into it, and filleth vs with his grace, and so Christ tarieth in vs and we in him. I aske howe, but by his grace? For Sander wil confesse, that which seemeth bread to tarie but a little while in vs: likewise, that the bodie of Christ tarieth no longer in vs then the kindes or shewes of bread and wine tarie in vs: Where▪ fore the tarying of Christ by grace in vs, proueth not his

reall receiuing of Christs flesh into our bodies. Yea, Sander saith himself: A litle of that blessed foode being receiued worthily of vs, is not so properly said to tarie in vs, as we to tari

I pray thee Sander, tell vs what is that blessed food thou speakest of, which doeth not properly tarie in vs? For of his flesh, Christ saith, that it is meate in deede, &amp; that hee tarieth in him which eateth it. And what is that which is smal in forme, the bodie of Christ, or the external sacrament, which thou callest the shewes of bread and wine, which in deede are small in forme? The bodie of Christ, I suppose thou art not so mad, to contract into smaller quantitie then it is, and as for the accidents or shewes of bread and wine, what vertue is in them? And in deede, yt onely worde of Cyrill, A litle of the blessing, meaning thereby the externall Sacrament, for the internall vertue thereof, ouerthroweth Popish transubstantiation, &amp; carnall manner of receiuing into the mouth. For by a little of the blessing, he meaneth not a litle of the bodie of Christ, nor the bodie of Christ in a litle quantitie, but a litle of the consecrated bread and wine, which by diuine and spirituall operation, is of infinite vertue to conuert vs into an heauenly and spirituall nature, aunswerable to our regeneration, which is testified vnto vs in baptisme. But Sander replyeth, that if the Sacrament were wheaten bread, it could not be true that a litle therof should drawe the whole man vnto it. I answere, if it were nothing but wheaten bread, it could do no such thing: but Cyril calleth it by the name of that which it is more principally, as it is a Sacrament, that is a blessing, which draweth the whole man to it, and filleth him with grace: E

                         modo in nobis Christus manet, &amp; nos in Christo, and by this meane doeth Christ dwell in vs and wee in him. To the terme of tarying naturally, vsed by Hilarie, I haue answered before. Theophylact I force not of, as beeing a late writter, although he say nothing in effect more thā Chrysostom and Cyrill. But Sander still vrgeth, what ioyning as of waxe &amp; leauen, what mingling can bee made of things so far distant as heauen &amp; earth? If you

say, by faith &amp; spirite, either you giue a cause of ioyning (saith Sander) which may stande with the cause alleaged by Christ, or else you correct his cause and put a better. I answere, we neither ad to, nor correct the cause of ioyning alledged by Christ, but expresse ye verie same which he doth: The wordes which I speake, are spirite &amp; life, but there be some among you that beleeue not. Nay (sayth Sander) our tarying in Christ is assigned to eating, and not onely to beleeuing. But we replie, that this eating is not corporall eating, but eating by faith &amp; spirite, which may be without eating the Sacrament, and yet eating the fleshe of Christ, not leauing the eating thereof (as Sander saith) and staying vppon feeding by faith alone, which is an absurde saying, for by faith wee feede vpon Christ through the vertue of his holy spirite.
               
               
                  CAP. XVII.
                  
                     We are made one with Christ by naturall participation of his Sander. flesh, as he being one nature with his father, hath assumpted our nature into his owne person.
                  
                  Sander alwaies reasoneth so, as he maketh eating by Fulk. faith and spirite, to exclude the fleshe of Christ and the vertue thereof, as in this chapter, he saith, Hee that eateth Christs fleshe, receiueth life of him, not by the meanes of faith &amp; spirite onely, but also by naturall participation of his flesh: as Christ liueth for the father, so he that eateth Christ shall liue for him: but Christ liueth not for his father in faith, nor by meane of spirite alone, as we take spirite for deuotion or spirituall giftes and qualities, but by his whole substance present in him. But whē wee say, that wee eate Christ by faith &amp; spirit, we meane not by spirite, deuotion, or spirituall gifts, but the working of the holy spirite, as the principall efficient cause, and faith as the instrumentall cause, by which wee eate Christ present in whole substance. The controuersie is not, whether wee must bee ioyned to Christ by eating of his flesh and drinking of his bloud, for that wee

beleue without al controuersie, that from the beginning of the world, to the end, none can be ioyned to Christ otherwise then by eating his flesh &amp; drinking his bloud: but whether Christes flesh can be eaten and drunken without eating bodily the Sacrament, that is the question. And therfore Sander maketh a large &amp; needlesse discourse, in this Chapter, to shew how Christ liueth for his father and how we must liue for him, that is by participation of his flesh and bloud, which is that naturall participation, whereof Hilary speaketh against the Arrians, which saied, we are ioyned to him onely in vnity of will, which is not so: for he by his incarnation, is naturally ioyned to vs, and we by participation of his flesh are naturally ioyned to him, so that wee are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, of which coniunction the Sacrament is an heauenly pledge and assurance. But now commeth Sander, and saith, that in foure pointes the Sacramentaries be against S. Hilary: first b

                        suppose Christes flesh not to be eaten of vs, and consequently not to be in vs, in his owne nature and substance. This is a false supposell, for we affirme Christes flesh to be eaten of al the elect of God, and whole Christ to be in them. Secondly they are against the Godhead of Christ, if we doe not liue by eating of Christs flesh as he by the father. This is the 2. slanderous cauell, answered before. Thirdly they are against the life of our bodyes, because they say that in the Sacrament, we eate nothing into our bodies, but bread and wine, which are not able to giue life to our bodies, whereby they may liue for euer. This is a peeuish Sophistry, we eate into our bodies, and we eate in the Sacrament bodilye nothing, but bread and wine, therefore we eat not at all. Yes, we eat the flesh of Christ both in the Sacrament and without it, with our soules which is of force to giue life both to bodies and soules. Fourthly they are against the foode of our bodies, which is the flesh of Christ. No forsooth, wee acknowledge that flesh of Christ to be foode to feede the whole man, body and soule vnto eternall life, but yet so to feede the body as it is not receiued corporally, nor feedeth corporally, but after a spirituall and diuine manner. And heere he maketh

the Zwinglians to affirme, that the sanctified bread in the supper, is the foode of our bodies, vnto eternall life, as water in baptisme is the instrument and meane as wel to bodies &amp; soules of euerlasting life. Which is vtterly false, for they affirme, neither ye bread to be food, nor the water to be regeneration otherwise, then as holy signes, seales, pledges, assurances of spirituall feeding and regeneration. But Sander by scripture, will destroy this comparison, affirming that God in deede may vse what meanes he will, to saue vs, but by his word, he hath testified his wil, yt baptisme hath his promise of saluatiō annexed to it, but no promise is made to material bread and wine, nor to him that eateth and drinketh them. I answere, neither is any promise made to the water in baptisme, but to him that receiueth it worthily, and to him that eateth and drinketh materiall bread and wine in the Sacrament, the like promise is made of remission of sinnes and of eternall life: not in respect of ye bread &amp; wine, but in respect of him that feedeth our faith by that Sacrament, and by faith and working of his holye spirite feedeth vs with his flesh and bloud, euen when that Sacrament is not receiued. But Cyril saith in Ioan, lib. 10, Cap. 13. Non poterat, &amp;c. This corruptible nature of the body could not otherwise be brought to incorruption and life, vnlesse the body of the naturall life, were ioyned vnto it. This is true: but the manner of the coniunction is all the matter we stand vpō, which we affirme must be such, as may ioyne euery body of Gods elect that hath bene &amp; shall be, to the body of the naturall life, which cannot be the Sacramētal coniunctiō or corporal receiuing of Christs naturall body into our bodies, which was denied to al ye fathers before Christes incarnation. And yet except euery one of their bodies had bene ioyned to the body of Christ, which is the body of naturall life, they could not be partakers of incorruptiō &amp; life, as Cyril saith. Therefore the manner of our coniunction, is not the receiuing of Christes body in at our mouthes, but an heauenlie &amp; diuine manner wrought by the spirit of God, apprehended by faith in all that haue heard the word of God 
                        ••

                  If Christ had not meant to giue his flesh in deed (saith Fulke. Sander) he would not haue cast a stumbling blocke in his disciples way, nor hindered their faith by wordes more hard then needed. I answere, he ment to giue them his flesh in deede, to be eaten, not only in his supper, but euen then presently, if they had bene faithfull to haue receiued it. And therefore he saith to them, he that eateth me, shall liue for me or by me, my flesh is meate in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede. Sander must remember, what he hath taught vs before, that Christes fleshe cannot bee meate in deede, except it bee eaten, but Christ saith it is meat in deede, before it was to be eaten in the Sacrament, therefore it was presently eaten by faith and spirite, and he speaketh not there of Sacramentall eating onely. Neither doth Cyrill say, that only in the Sacrament, Christes flesh is eaten, although he shew that Christ instructed his Apostles, when he gaue them fragmenta panis, pecces of bread, how his flesh might be eaten, in Ioan lib. 4. Cap. 14. namely spiritually and not corporally.

                  Basil, Chrysostome, and Augustine, (saith Sander) Fulke. expounde the name flesh for carnall and fleshlye vnderstanding of the Iewes: which Caluine of Luciferian pride reprocueth: And yet Augustine and Cy

to giue euerlasting life. See the ran

                     or of Sander, which condemneth Caluine of diuellish pride, for refusing one interpretation of some fathers, &amp; taking the exposition of others, and that, which one of the same fathers doth cheefely followe, as Sander doth confesse. But now (saith he) what neede more adoe? If this saying apperteine not to the last supper, it maketh nothing against our beleefe. If it doe apperteine, they are wordes propheticall, fulfilled in the supper. I haue often shewed how all this doctrine of eating the flesh of Christ, perteineth to the supper, and howe it perteineth not. And this I prooue out of this saying against your Popish opinion, wherein you holde that wicked men eate Christes flesh. Our sauiour Christe shewing whence his fleshe hath power to giue life, namely not of it selfe, but of the spirite, doth also shewe the necessary effect of his spirit, which is neuer separated from his flesh. The spirit (saith he) quickneth or giueth life: seeing therefore that no man can receiue the fleshe of Christe separated from his spirite, no man can receiue his flesh, but he that receiueth it quickning or giuing life. But where Sander saith, that when Christ gaue his body, he gaue it after a spirituall sorte, and no
                           •
                         after a fleshly manner. It might seeme that he fully agreed with vs in minde, as he doth in wordes: but when he cō
                     meth to expounde spiritually and fleshly, he declareth, that he meaneth not to exclude, all fleshly manners, but only one maner of eating his body by pieces, as though the eating of it whole according to their imagination into their bodies were not also a fleshly manner: but when he cōmeth to spirituall sort, he expoundeth it only by inuisible sort: as though he which giueth a piece of golde closed in a paper, so that it could not be seene, did giue it after a spirituall manner. As for the conuersion of bread and wine into his body and bloud, his presence at the table and in their mouthes, and in heauen, &amp;c. shew not a spirituall manner of giuing his body, but a monstrous alteration of bodily thinges, which are affirmed to be so really and corporally, and yet contrary to the nature of all thinges and bodies spoken of.

I omitt his ridiculous interpretations of Ieremies saying. Let vs put wood into his bread, which he applyeth to the crucifying of Christs flesh, where yet wodde was not put into his flesh, but his flesh put vpon wodde. But the Prophet rehearseth the saying of his aduersaries, which threatened to giue him wood in steede of bread, that is to famish him in the stockes. Likewise of Abacuks saying: Hornes are in his hands, which he meanein of the almightie power of God, often called figuratiue hornes, Sander referreth it to the corners of the crosse, which yet were not in the hands of Christ, but his hands stretched out toward them.

                      figuratiue &amp; vnproper as, I am the bread that came, &amp;c. yet were these wordes spirite &amp; life, and so are all the words of the Gospel, that is, giue h
                        ••
                     , if they be spiritually vnderstood, I say not alwayes figuratiuely, but always beleued to be true in that sense they are vttered &amp; ment by him, whether they be figuratiue or proper, as concerning the prhase. Thirdly, the wordes of Christ are spirite and life, because they make

the spiritual bodie of Christ, which is a spirituall food, as Ambrose sayth, de ijs qui myster, init. Cap. 9. Ambrose saith truely, that for asmuch as the bodie of Christ is a spiritual bodie, it is not a corporal food, but a spiritual food. Why is it not a corporall food, seeing it feedeth our bodies as well as our soules? Verily, because it is not receiued corporally, but spiritually, which is ye difference in which we stande. Wee agreefully with Augustine, in Ioan. Tra. 27. The words of Christ are to be vnderstanded spiritually, &amp; so are spirite &amp; life to vs, as they be of their owne nature, howsoeuer vnfaithful persons esteem of them, they worke whatsoeuer it pleaseth him to signifie to be wrought by them, as Basil teacheth de Bap. lib. 1. Cap. 2. We beleeue, as Chrysostom teacheth, Hom. 47. in Ioan. That they conteine no naturall course, but are free from all earthly necessitie. And therefore, when Christ promiseth to giue vs his flesh to be eaten, &amp; deliuereth the breade, calling it his bodie, we beleeue his words to be spirite and life, that is not to conteine any naturall course, but to be free from all earthly necessitie, that is, we beleeue vnfainedly to be fed with Christes bodie and bloud, although we do not eate &amp; drinke it corporally with our mouth, which is a naturall course of eating, we beleeue, that by the flesh &amp; bloud of Christ, both our bodies &amp; soules are nourished wonderfully vnto eternall life, not thinking it necessarie, that the flesh and bloud of Christ should carnally enter into our bodies, as the Papistes teache, for that is an earthlie necessitie, from which the words of Christ, are free, &amp; yet the onlie thing that Sander vrgeth so vehemently, &amp; without the which he thinketh it impossible to communicate with the fleshe and bloud of Christ.
                  But Sander cōmandeth al heretikes to cease to mocke them, for making so many myracles in the Sacrament of the altar, because the wordes of Christ, This is my body, are spirite and life. Nay verily, this argument will stirre vp all men to mocke the Papistes more then they did before: seeing they thinke it lawfull to faine what miracles they will in the Sacrament, because Christes

words be spirite &amp; trueth, &amp; yet more to laugh at Sa
                        •
                     
                     ders reason, which will prooue these wordes to be most proper, &amp; least figuratiue, because they partake most of the godhead, in which there is no change, wheras figures or tropes come of the Greeke worde, which signifieth changing. Notwithstanding this great clerk, oftentimes before hath taught vs, that whatsoeuer is spoken of bread and meat, and eating in Iohn 6. Chapter, vntill he come to this saying: (And the bread which I wil giue is my flesh) doth pertaine to the godhead of Christ, and the participation therof by faith: in which wordes he cannot denie, but bread, meat, eate, hunger, thirst, &amp;c. must bee taken figuratiuely. But what drunkennesse is it to reason of these words only? This is my body, when all the wordes of Christ, as well figuratiue speeches, as proper, be spirite and life, as well as these. Yet now now we shall see a whole world of difference betweene the wordes of the Gospel &amp; the interpretation of false gospellers, betwen the old fathers &amp; ye new brethren. For Christ (saith he) was by his incarnation made the bread of life to the end we might eate his godhead otherwise then the fathers had done before. The newe brethren bid vs feede vpon him by faith alone, as Noe &amp; Abraham did. I trust it shalbe sufficient to proue those new brethren, to be ye right children &amp; heires of those olde fathers, when they haue all one matter of saluation, the flesh and bloud of Christ, &amp; all one instrument of eating, faith alone. And why should the new brethren eate the godhead, or manhood of Christ, otherwise in substance, then the olde fathers did? But Sander asketh, where is the word of God so giuen me after his incarnation, as it could not be giuen before? And I aske Sander, wherfore it should bee giuen nowe otherwise then it was before? and why it could not be giuen before so as it is giuen now? but that he will binde the worde of God to a naturall course, &amp; not suffer his working to be free from earthly necessitie? He demandeth further, where is any euerlasting meat for his bodie? I demaund likewise, wher was any euerlasting meat for the bodie of Noe &amp; Abraham our fathers? But

Sander saith his flesh is rebellious to his spirite, and hath neede to be fedde, his bodie was the meane to poyson his soule, therefore his soule must haue a medicine, which shall be receiued into his bodie. I answere, the flesh of our olde fathers Noah and Abraham was rebellious to the spirite, had neede to be fed, were a meane to poyson the soule &amp;c, yet needed they not, that the flesh of Christ should be receiued into their bodies, that it might bee a medicine vnto their soules: no more is it needful for the newe brethren that are their children. But let vs see the other differences. Irenaeus reprooued them that denyed the resurrection of mens bodyes, because Godly men in scripture are called spirituall: the newe brethren wrest the name of spirite or spirituall bodie, to denie the real substance of flesh in the sacrament: Nay, they inferre yt the maner of ye eating must be spiritual, in which respect it is called a spirituall bodie, and not onely for the power of quickning which it hath of yt spirit of Christ. But it is a great mysterie, that where S. Paul 1. Tim. 3. woulde haue Deacons to be chosen of such men, as haue the mysterie of faith in a pure conscience, Sander thinketh, hee meaneth the Sacrament, which in their masse at the consecration of ye bloud, is called mysterium sidei, &amp; in Iustinus time was deliuered by ye Deacons. O blockish imagination! such be the arguments of poperie. But if it be so, why is not the breade so called in your Masse, as well as the cuppe? And if there bee a speciall reason why the cuppe shoulde rather bee so called, what conscience haue your Priests and Deacons to spoile ye people therof, and not to deliuer it as the Deacons did in ye time of Iustinus? The other differences that without order he heapeth and repeteth, come al to this end, yt we deny the flesh of Christ any way to be profitable; yt we affirme yt spirit to quicken vs, wtout eating of Christ in his supper; we wrest to the spirit of man, that which Christ saith of ye spirit of god: al which is false &amp; slāderous, for as I haue oftē shewed. We beleue it to be of necessity yt we shold eat &amp; drink ye flesh &amp; blod of Christ, which by vertue of his spirit hath power to giue eternal life to al them that receiue it, we

acknowledge all the words of Christ to be spirit and l

                      say that flesh and bloude signifieth bread and wine, and the same breade and wine must againe signifie the flesh and bloud of Christ: although wee say that bread and wine in the sacrament are a seale and confirmation of that doctrine which Christe teacheth in this Chapter, concerning the eating and drinking of his very true and naturall flesh and bloud, which hath power to seede vnto eternall life, them that eat and drinke it spiritually, as there is none other way of eating and drinking thereof, but by faith through the almightie working of Gods holy spirite.

                     tome, Augustine, Theodoret whom hee nameth, or any before or after their time, for 600 yeares, that euer the visible Sacrament was adored as ye very bodie of Christ. If he haue any thing to shewe, we shall haue it hereafter. But it is a follie (he saith) vpon allegation of a thing so farre beyonde the memorie of man, as the primitiue Church is, to leaue the custome of the present Church, which Christ no lesse redeemed, gouerneth, and loueth, then he did the faithfull of the first sixe hundreth yeares. I answere shortly, that is not the Church of Christ, but of antichrist, which of late yeares hath taught, the worshiping of the sacrament, as God and man. And whereas, Sander replieth, that then we shall haue no quietnes or end of controuersies, if heretikes may appeale to the primitiue Church, as the Trinitaries in Poolande, and the Circumciders in Lithuania, for these appeale to the primitiue Church, and denie writings of Fathers and scriptures, as the Protestant: I answere, the Protestants receiue all the canonicall scriptures, by which all heresie may be condemned, the autoritie or practise of the primitiue Church, they alledge but as a witnesse of trueth, which is sufficient prooued out of the worde of God. Whereas he saith, there was but one vniuersall chaunge to bee looked for in religion, which was to be made by Christ: I affirme, the trueth of Christs religion to be vnchangeable, but there was an vniuersall chaunge to be looked for from Christes religion, to Antichrist, which saint Paul calleth an Apostasie, &amp; saint Iohn in the Reuelation, the cuppe of fornication, whereof all nations should drinke &amp;c. Yet was not this chaunge so vniuersal, but that the seruants of God, though in small number and credit, with the world, were preserued out of that generall

apostasie, and called out of Babylon, as wee see it nowe come to passe, by the preaching of the eternall Gospel, then also foreshewed, Apocal. 14. 17. 18. &amp;c.
                  Another reason, why we shoulde giue none eare to them, that say the words are figuratiue, is for that then wee shoulde doubt of our former faith, and in doubting become men that lacke faith. And why should you not onely doubt, but refuse a false opinion, beleeued contrarie to the worde of God? But wee must tell Sander, whether hee that gaue eare first to Berengarius and Zwinglius, may giue eare to an other that shoulde say the Apostels had no authoritie to write holie Scriptures. No forsooth, for hee that gaue eare to Berengarius and Zwinglius, did heare them, because they brought the authoritie of scriptures, which is the onely certaine rule of truth, against which no question or doubt may be mooued. As for the opinion of carnall presence, if it had beene as generally receiued before Berengarius, as Sander falsely affirmeth, yet it was lawfull to bring it to the triall of holy Scriptures, as we doe all the articles of our faith which are true, not so much because they are generally receiued, as for that they are manifestly approued, by the authoritie of the holy scriptures.
                  But Sander will yet enter farther, into the bowels of the cause, &amp; before he heare what reasons cā be brought against the popish faith, he saith the Sacramentaries cannot possiblie haue any grounde of their doctrine, that the wordes of Christ in the supper are figuratiue, either in respect of the worde written, or the faith of all Christians, or the glorie of God, or the loue of Christ toward vs, or the profite of his Church. Yes verilie, all these fiue respects, moue vs to take the wordes of Christ at his supper to be figuratiue. And, First the word written by saint Luke, and saint Paul, This cuppe is the newe Testament in my bloude: which wordes being manifestly figuratiue, haue the same sense that the other

rehearsed by Saint Matthewe, and Saint Marke, This is my bloude: and that these wordes haue, This is my bodie, which are vsed by all fower: Therefore by the written worde, they are all figuratiue and signifie the deliuerie of a Sacrament or seale of the newe couenant established in the death and bloudshedding of the sonne of God.
                  Secondly, the faith of all Christians, for sixe hundred yeares and more after Christe, hath beene sufficiently prooued to haue vnderstoode the wordes figuratiuely, for a figure, signe, token, pledge of the bodie and bloude of Christe, and not for the verie substance contained in formes of breade and wine. Insomuch, that the verie glosse vppon the Canon Lawe, De cons. dist. 2. Cap. Hoc est, hath these wordes, 
                        Coeleste Sacramentum quod verè representat Christi carnem, dicitur corpus Christi, sed impropriè: vnde dicitur suo modo, sed non in veritate sed significante mysterio, vt sit sensus, vocatur corpus Christi, id est significat. The heauenly Sacrament which truely representeth the fleshe of Christ, is called the bodie of Christ, but improperly. Whereof it is saide to bee after a peculyar manner, but not in trueth of the thing, but in a signifying mysterie: So that the sense is, it is called the bodie of Christe, that is to saye, it signifieth it. The author of this glosse, durst not haue written thus, if it had not beene an opinion generally receiued, that the wordes of Christ were not proper, but figuratiue.
                  Thirdely it is against the glorie of GOD that the bodie of Christ, shoulde be so made present, as it should enter not onely into the mouth of wicked persons, as a deade bodie working no life, but also into the bellyes of brute beastes, which is euen horrible to name.
                  Fourthly it is not agreeable to the loue of Christ toward vs in his second comming, that his bodie by such a presence shoulde bee thought to haue lost all naturall conditions of a substantiall bodie, seeing the

scripture putteth vs in hope, that our vile bodies shall be made confirmable at his comming to his glorious body, Philip. 3. Wherefore that heresie of carnall presence, is contrarie to our faith of the resurrection of our bodies.
                  Fiftly, it is against the profite of Christes Church, which by his ascension is drawen vpward into heauen from the earth, but by this imagined presence, is mooued to looke downe vnto Christ vpon the earth. Col. 3. Therfore in all these respects, the exposition of the wordes must be figuratiue.
                  Another reason Sander hath, that seeing all figures were inuented either for lacke of words, or for pleasantnesse of speaking, and Christ neither lacked wordes nor can be prooued to haue spoken figuratiuely, onely for his pleasure, therefore he spake not figuratiuely. If there be no more causes of figuratiue speach, then these two noted by Sander, then Christ neuer vsed any figuratiue speaches, for hee neuer wanted wordes, to haue spoken properly that other men could speake properly, neither can he be prooued to haue spoken figuratiuely, only for his pleasure, and least of all, he affected the praise of Eloquence. But if it be out of question: &amp; Sander also cō
                     fesseth, that in other places, Christ spake figuratiuely, then is it out of question, that this argument of Sander is not worth the paring of his nayles. For there are other causes of figuratiue speaches, then these two by him alledged, and especially the profite of the hearers, who are more moued, and better vnderstande often times by figuratiue, then by proper speaches. And for this cause, y• holy ghost speaking of Sacraments, doth vsually call thē (figuratiuely, by the names of that they signifie &amp; seale vnto vs, as the Lamb is called ye Passeouer, baptisme regeneration, the bread his bodie, the cuppe the newe Testament. The profite that wee take by these kinde of speaches, is great, for they admonish
                        •
                     s to be as sure of the things, as we are of the signes, when the signes beare the name of the things signified and promised by them.
                  Of Saint Augustines rule of figuratiue speaches, Sander, that loueth no repetitions, hath written a whole

Chapter before, lib. 3. Cap. 14. and therefore I will say no more of it here, onely I note that by quoting the place, hee abuseth Augustines rule, against his owne example which he bringeth of eating and drinking the body and bloud of Christ, to proue that Christes wordes are not figuratiue, when Augustine saith expresly, those wordes are figuratiue which Christe spake of eating and drinking his flesh and bloud.
                  The rocke was Christ, (he sayeth) must needes be a figuratiue speach, because it can not be proper. And for the same cause, say we, These wordes. This is my body, are figuratiue, for yt they can not be proper. But Sander replieth, that if he had saide, this breade is my body, it might haue beene so thought, for breade cannot bee his body no more then the rocke be Christ. yet S. Paul doubteth not, to say, this bread, of that of which before he had said, this is my bodie. 1. Cor. 11. And I aske Sander, what was that which Christ had in his hand, and whereof he said this? It coulde not be his bodie, before the words of consecration spokē as all Catholike papists affirme: then it was bread, then, the word following Is, will not suffer the sense to be, this shalbe my body, wherefore in effect it is all one to say, hauing bread in his hand, This is my body, and to say, This bread is my body, the one is impossible by Sanders confession: ergo by necessitie of argument the other.
               
               
                  CAP. II.
                  
                     That at all other, so the wordes of Christes supper, ought to Sanden. bee taken properlie, vntill the contrarie doeth euidently appeare.
                  
                  By autoritie of Tertullian and Marcellus the Lawyer, he laboureth to proue, that all words must be taken in Fulke. their proper signification, except the contrarie be manifestly showen. Likewise Epiphanius affirmeth, that all wordes in the Scripture, neede not to be taken figuratiuelie, and that to know which is figuratiue, and which is not, diligent consideration and ancient tradition helpeth

much. All this I confesse, but withall I affirme, that these wordes: This is my bodie, both by diligent consideration, and ancient tradition, are found to bee figuratiue. Neither hath Sander any thing to the contrarie. Yes I wis: the Pronowne, This (saith he) pointeth not to a thing absent. No verilie, for it pointeth to the breade that was in his hande. Neither the Verbe, Is, can bee saide of that, which presently hath no true being: ergo it cannot bee saide of the bodie of Christe, which by your owne diuinitie, hath no being in the Sacrament, before the last syllable of Hoc est corp
                           ••
                         meum bee pronounced, then it is necessarie to bee saide of the breade in his hande, whiche had a true being. And then by your owne rule in the Chapter before, these wordes being as much, as This breade is my bodie, must needes bee figuratiue, because they cannot bee proper, for breade and Christes bodie, bee two seuerall-natures, that cannot stande together.
               
               
                  CAP. III.
                  
                     The proper signification of these wordes: This is my bodie, 
                        Sander. and This is my bloude, is, that the substance of Christs bodie and bloude is contained vnder the visible formes of bread and wine.
                  
                  If the speech were proper and not figuratiue, yet Fulke. the substance of breade being shewed, and the substance of the cuppe, and of that which is in the cuppe being shewed, it woulde not followe, the bodie and bloude to bee vnder these accidentes of breade and wine, but either with the substance of breade and wine, or rather that his bodie and bloude were breade and wine. For Sanders similitude hath nothing like to this matter, this is an Elephant, that is, the substance of an Elephant is contained vnder this visible forme. But let him bring example of any thing

which bearing visible forme of one substance, is called by the name of another substance. Might not Moses haue said truly to the Israelites in the wildernes in the behalfe of God, pointing to the Rocke: This is Christ, or the bodie of Christ, as well as Saint Paule saith, that Rocke was Christ? Therefore looke what woulde be the sense of those wordes, the same will bee the sense of these wordes, taking the speaches either as proper, or figuratiue.
                  But Christ (saith he) hath forced vs to seeke out this interpretation in causing Saint Luke and S. Paul to write, This Chalice is the newe Testament in my bloud. For of necessitie wee must interpret these wordes, This Chalice, that is to say, the thing contained in this Chalice, is my bloud. I pray you sir what necessitie? except the speach be figuratiue. You will say it is figuratiuely onely for the cuppe, to signifie that which is contained therein. If you so say, then tell mee once againe, whether these wordes, The newe Testament in my bloude, bee all one in proper speach, with these wordes, my bloude. If the newe Testament in my bloude, bee all one in sense, with these wordes my bloude, they are figuratiue: for no man properlie vseth so to speake, that hee nameth the newe Testament in his bloude, when hee nameth nothing, but his bloude naturally. If these wordes bee figuratiue, not onelie in the name of cuppe, but in the wordes following, whiche are, is the newe Testament in my bloude: then the wordes of the supper are founde to bee figuratiue, and all the babling about This, and Is, and bodie, and bloude, and mine, &amp;c. are vaine and foolish: for This and Is, are in this figuratiue speech, and that in one manner of speaking is called, My bloude, in an other, is called the newe Testament in my bloude, and by necessarie analogie, that whiche in one manner of speech is vttered by these wordes, My bodie, may and ought truely to bee vnderstoode and

vttered in these wordes: The new Testament in my bodie crucified. That the Pronowne hoc, is the Neuter gender, and hic the Masculine gender, it prooueth not the alteration of substance, for the genders followe the names, and note no substantiall propertie, where the thinges differ not in the sexe. But where you saide first, the Pronowne pointeth to the visible formes, nowe you say it pertaineth rather to the Substantiue (bodie) where it endeth, then to the formes, you are not onely contrarie to your selfe, but also to the schoolemen, which say it pointeth to neither of both, but vnto indiuiduum vagum, a singular vncertaine or wandering thing. But point it as you will, it can haue no true literall sense, if you will holde your owne principles: for if the bodie bee not present before the wordes of consecration vttered, as all papists (I thinke) except Sander, will affirme: That which hee had in his hande was breade, at that instant, when hee saide, This. And Sander himselfe saith: This which appeared to them breade, to bee in substance at the ending of the wordes, His owne bodie: Ergo it was not so before the wordes ended, and howe can, is, a Verbe of the present tense, signifie that which shall bee after, although it bee neuer so soone after? But of the Pronowne This, wee shall haue occasion to speake in three Chapters following, and diuerse times it is repeted in this booke, although hee protest in the Preface that he delighted not to speake one thing twise.
               
               
                  CAP. IIII.
                  
                     That the pronowne (this) in Christes wordes, can point neither Sander. to bread nor to wine.
                  
                  I haue prooued before, that if it can point to nothing else, if it point to anie thing, that was there Fulke. present, but vnto breade and wine, because bodie and bloude, by your owne principle, was not there present before the last syllable of the sentence vttered.
                  But Sander saith (this) signifieth a substance, because

Christ saith not, This is in my body, but this is my bodie, which is a blockish reason, for Christ saith, This is ye new Testament, which is an Accident, &amp; in my bloud, as well as This is my bloude. Well, the Protestants opinion is (saith he) that This pointeth to the bread and the wine, which signifie his bodie &amp; bloud. But that cannot be, because this cannot agree with breade and wine, neither in Greeke nor Latine, and then telleth vs, the genders of the nownes, &amp;c. But good Sir: the pronowne This, is the newter gender, put absolutely, comprehending in signification that thing, which was shewed, which needed not to bee called breade and wine, because it was so to bee iudged by the bodilie senses. But then (saith Sander) you correct the wordes of Christ, as though he had said, This which is breade, is my bodie, and then euerie substance of bread shoulde signifie his bodie. He that giueth the true meaning of Christes wordes, doeth not correct them, neither doe wee referre the Pronowne This, to the generall substance of breade, but affirme, that it demonstrateth that breade onely, which he at that time tooke for to make thereof a Sacrament. And whereas it is translated in Latine: Hic est sanguis, the Greeke retaineth the Newter gender. And an Adiectiue betweene two Substantiues of diuerse genders, maie agree with either of them, but that the Pronowne This, is to bee referred to the wine, the other Euangelistes doe shewe, which vtter it thus, this cuppe, that is, the wine in this cuppe. And whereas Cyprian sayeth, haec est caro mea, hee might aswell haue said, pointing to bread, hoc est caro mea, or hic panis est caro mea, and yet his words, as he vttereth them, haue none other meaning, euen as Moses speaking of the rainbowe in the person of GOD, saith, Hoc est signum foederis, &amp;c. This is the signe of the couenaunt, where hoc agreeing in gender, with signum, doeth yet demonstrate the rainebowe, which is there a Nowne of the Masculine gender.
                  Moses speaking to the Israelites of Manna, Exodus

16. saieth: Iste est panis, quem dominus &amp;c. This is the breade, whiche the Lorde hath giuen you to eate. In the Latine, the pronowne This, agreeth with panis, which is the Masculine gender, yet doth it demonstrate, Man, which is the Newter. Therefore this grammaticall discourse, of genders of nownes, Adiectiues and their Substantiues, serueth to no purpose, to prooue that bread and wine were not poynted in the wordes of Christ by the Pronowne This.
               
               
                  CAP. V.
                  
                     That the Pronowne (This) cannot point to any certaine acts, Sander. which is a doing about the breade and wine.
                  
                  The Pronowne (saieth hee) is of the singular number, and therefore it cannot signifie many thinges, done about the breade, as taking, breaking, blessing, &amp;c. and seeing it can point but one thing, it can point no one acte certainely. To this ridiculous argument, I answere, that the Pronowne (this) doeth demonstrate that breade, with all actions, and accidents belonging to it, so that the sense is: This breade thus taken, blessed, broken, giuen, eaten, is my bodie, that is (as Tertullian, and Augustine saye) a figure or signe of my bodie, euen as the Lambe is saide to bee the Passeouer, but not a Lambe nakedly considered, but with all circumstances and actions to it belonging: such a Lambe, so taken, killed, the bloude so sprinckled, the bodie 
                        •
                     osted, eaten, standing with staues in their handes &amp;c, this is the Passeouer, that is, a Sacrament of the Passeouer. You see that the Pronowne being the singular number, may demonstrate a singular substance, but with all actions belonging to it.

                     and particularly signifieth inChristes supper one certeine kinde of foode.
                  
                  He taketh for proued, that which is proued to be vntrue, Fulk. that the Pronowne This, pointeth not the bread &amp; wine, and thereof concludeth, that it pointeth onely the bodie and bloud: but the first is false, ergo, the later. But if you be so hastie, saieth Sander, that you will not tarie the speaking of foure wordes, to know what particular and finall substance the Pronown This, doth point vnto, then this doeth meane, this eatable thing. Sir, our haste is not so great, but we can stay a much longer time to knowe our masters meaning: But seeing you beare vs in hande, that one substance is made of another, by these wordes spoken, which aske a time in speaking, and you your selues determine at what instant the change is soudenly made al at once, and would proue the same by the Pronowne This, and euery other of the wordes, you must giue vs leaue to consider euery moment of time, in which they are spoken. For then euery worde is true, when the things whereof the wordes are signes, agree with the worde, in that time in which they are vttered: for this proposition, euery man is dead, cannot be true, because euery man shall die, before euery man be dead. And to that you saye, This, meaneth this eatable thing, I affirme, you are neuer the neere: for, if there bee not bread, what thing is there eatable before it be the body
                        •
                      and the bodie it is not, before the wordes are all vttered. If by an eatable thing, you meane Duns his indiuiduum vagum, then you renounce your former position, so often aduouched, that the Pronowne This pointeth to a certaine substance, and so you are rapped on the sco

He were a madde man that would reason so: that because Fulke. one word is figuratiue, all the rest must be figuratiue: but this is a good argument: one word is figuratiue, ergo more may be, and figuratiue speeches are net inconuenient to be vsed in the institutiō of a Sacrament. Therefore Sander might haue spared his seuen reasons, which he bringeth to prooue, that the naming of the chalis prooueth not all the rest of the wordes to be figuratiue. But the naming of the chalis, the new Testament in his bloud, doth inuincibly prooue, al ye other speeches to be figuratiue. For the same sense is of these wordes: This is my bloud: and of these, This cuppe is the newe Testament in my bloud: but ye sense of these latter words is figuratiue, not only in respect of the word chalis, but of the new Testament in his bloud: ergo the sense of the former wordes is figuratiue. And whereas Sander saieth the Apostles could not coniecture, that est, was put for significat, which fewe but great doctors can discerne, token of thinges, to be somtime called by the names of thinges themselues: I say he doth the Apostles wrong, who beeing brought vp in the daiely exercise of the Sacramentes of the lawe, could not be ignorant, that the Lambe was called the Passeouer, whereof it was a token, and circumcision the couenant of God, whereof it was a seale, and so of many other: but these two were their principall Sacramentes, vnto which with vs, baptisme and the Lordes supper doth answere.

                     That the wordes of Christes supper be proper, though many other be figuratiue and vnproper. Sander.
                     
                  
                  Why these wordes of our sauiour, This is my body, be not like other of his sayings, in which he is said to be Fulk. the dore, the way, the true vine: Iohn Bapt. to be Elias: or the rocke, to be Christ, he promiseth to declare in the last Chapiter, which is specially intituled against Master Nowels chalenge, and by him throughly confuted.

The vniuersall consent, that he boasteth of, in discerning of figuratiue speeches, can neuer be prooued, to haue receiued the wordes of Christ for proper. Two reasons yet he alleageth, why none of those propositions, doth so much as seeme to sound, like the wordes of the supper. One, for that they name two seuerall natures as Iohn baptist and Elias. That is false, for not naming Iohn Baptist, Christ saith 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , This is Helias. The other, they speake not of any certeine thing, or else they point not to it as to a thing present. This is likwise false, for Helias was a certeine thing, and hee that was pointed vnto, by the Pron
                        •
                     une, This, was present. Last of all, where he chalengeth vs to shewe, where that Proposition is figuratiue, which first instituteth and maketh any thing, I haue shewed before, that the propositions, which God vseth instituting and making the sacraments of circumcision and the Paschal, are figuratiue. For speaking of circumcsion of the flesh, he saieth to Abraham, this is my couenant, Gen. 17. And of the Lambe to bee slaine and vsed as he appointeth, he saith, you shall eate it in haste, for it is the Passeouer of the Lorde. These are words of institution, yet are they figuratiue, for circumcision was not the couenant, nor the Lambe the Passeouer, but figuratiuely seales, signes, and tokens of them.
               
               
                  CAP. IX.
                  
                     It is shewed by 27 circumstances of Christes supper, that hee Sander. made his reall flesh and bloud present, vnder the formes of bread and wine, and consequently, that his words are proper. The first circumstance of Christs last supper, is to consider who made it.
                  
                  Howe necessarie the consideration of the circumstances of euery place of Scripture is, for the true vnderstanding Fulke. thereof, euerie wise man will acknowledge, but no circumstance alone, nor all the circumstances together, do prooue these wordes of Christ to be proper and not figuratiue. As first we acknowledge ye maker of the supper

to be almighty, to do whatsoeuer it pleased him, but although he were sent in the flesh to men that were flesh, promiseth his flesh, and giueth his flesh, all which we constantly beleeue: yet it followeth not, that he purposed to giue his flesh in the Sacrament, after his incarnation, otherwise then he gaue it to the Patria
                        •
                     kes, before his incarnation. Acknowledging also the prouidence, wisdome, trueth, and goodnesse of the speaker, we affirme, that he speaketh heere most wisely, prouidently, truely, and well, but yet figuratiuely, without that he doth blind his spouse with figuratiue wordes (as Sander saith) which he doth no more, then God blinded his spowse, the Church of Israel, with figuratiue wordes; when he spake figuratiuely in the institution of the Sacramentes of circumcision, and of the Paschall lambe.
                  
                     The second circumstance may be to consider the time when Sander. the supper was made.
                  
                  The consideration of the time, which was the night Fulke. before he suffered, forbad him not, to vse figuratiue spech sufficiently to be vnderstoode, by the vsuall phrase of the scripture, speaking of Sacramentes. And therefore hee said, This cuppe is the new Testament in my bloud: neither is he to be burthened, with the misunderstanding of heretikes, which vpon colour of his words, imagine a presence, that can not stand with the trueth of his bodie, like vnto our bodies, contrary to other manifest places of scripture Heb. 2. Phil. 3.
                  
                     The thirde circumstance concerning the persons who were a
                           •
                         
                        Sander. the last supper.
                  
                  The Apostles that were present, haue sufficiently in their writinges testified those wordes to be figuratiue, Fulke. although they haue not expressedly saied, they are figuratiue. S. Mathew calling that which Christ dranke and gaue to be drunk, the fruit of yt vine, which is not bloud but wine, S. Paul. calling it bread, which is broken, &amp;c.

and the cuppe the newe Testament in his bloud, beside many other argumentes of the nature of Christs humanitie, like vnto ours in all substantiall pointes, which must of necessity inforce a figuratiue speech. And whereas Sander saith, that parables are spoken, so that men hearing doe not vnderstande: ergo Christ spake not in parables to his Apostles, to whom the mysteries of the kingdome were knowen. The argument is naught. For although parables are to blind the reprobat, yet are they to giue vnderstanding to the elect, and therefore Christ spake many thinges in parables, which are for better edifiyng of the Churche then if they had beene spoken plainely &amp; without all parable. Thirdly the Apostles, which taried at Caparnaū, by his doctrine there deliuered, had learned how to eate ye body of Christ &amp; to drink his bloud, not as Sander saith, really vnder the formes of bread and wine, but spiritually, by faith in a Sacrament or mysteric.
                  
                     The 4. circumstance, concerning the ending of the olde Passeouer, and the making of a newe. Sander.
                     
                  
                  The ending of the olde Passeouer, which was a signe, Fulke. doeth no more hinder the institution of a new signe, which is not corporally, that which it signifieth, no more then the ending of circumcision, hindreth the ordeining of baptisme, which is not actually that, which it representeth. That Sander denieth Moyses &amp; Phinees to haue eaten the flesh of Christ, because the law brought nothing to perfection, it is a slender reason: for Moses and Phinees did not eate the flesh of Christ, by vertue of the lawe, but by promise of the Gospel, by force whereof, Christ was the same matter of saluation to them that he is to vs. Augustine saith our Sacraments are signis diuersa, in re quae significatur paria, diuerse in signes, equall in the thing that is signified. In Ioan Tr. 26.
                  
                     The fifth circumstance, concerning the preface which Christ made before his supper. Sander.
                     
                  
                  
                     
The preface he speaketh of, are these words of Christ: I haue desired with desire to eate this Passeouer with Fulk. you, before I die. Which words he forceth not whether they be referred to the old Paschal lambe, or to the new. If they be referred to the newe, Christ desireth onely to eate his owne bodie with his Apostles, as Chrysostome sayeth, to encourage them not to bee afraide thereof, which he could not doe by faith onely, therefore he did it really, wherein is none absurditie to eate it, Angels feede of it, seeing other men haue eaten their own flesh in a grosse manner, either for hunger, or for anger, or phansie, &amp;c. To this I answere: first if a lyar could alwayes remember himselfe, it shoulde skill to Sanders purpose, that these wordes should not be referred to the newe Sacrament, for then Christ in calling it, this pascall lambe, or Passeouer, should begin to speake figuratiuely.
                  Secondly, I marueile, why he saith, it is a thing cleane impossible, that Christ should eate it by faith. How did he at other times eate the Paschal lambe? did he not eate it with faith? how was he baptized? did he not also beleeue? Although Christ partaking the Sacramentes instituted for sinful men, had a singular manner of partaking, which no man else had, that is for the profite of other, &amp; not himselfe, who needed them not, yet there is no doubt, but bearing our person, he did partake them with faith. For, of whome is it saide? he trusted in God, &amp;c. Psa. 22. And to that which Sander sayeth, he did eate of it, as Angels feede of it, (which cannot be corporally, but spiritually:) I agree with him, that it is no absurditie, so he will graunt mee two things: the one, that he did none otherwise eate his bodie in the supper, then he was borne againe in baptisme. The other, that it will suffise him, that we so eate the bodie of Christ, as Angels feede of it, which are thereby nourished and established in eternall life, and yet cannot receiue his body corporally into their spirites. As for the argument taken of other men, eating their owne flesh, for hunger, anger, or phansie, to prooue that it is no absurditie for

Christ to eate his owne flesh corporally, is verie absurd. For a
                        ••
                     eit, some men haue eaten their flesh for hunger, ange
                        •
                     , or phansie, yet was it an absurditie for them so to doe. Then of an argument, which is Consentaneum, to cō
                     clude negatiuely, it may be called absurdum absurdorum. Againe, if it had beene none absurditie for men to eate their owne flesh, for hunger, anger, or phansie, yet no mā did euer eate his whole bodie: and therefore the absurditie of Christ eating his owne bodie after that manner, is not by their example auoided.
                  But if the desire of Christ (saith he) be referred to the old Paschal Lambe, yet was it in respect, that at the ending thereof, the newe might be instituted, which Chrysostome calleth the trueth, that was perfourmed when the figure was past, in Psa. 37. Lo Christ desireth ye trueth, which is his owne substance, which is the onely meate, wherein God taketh pleasure. To this I answere, a desire is, of that which is absent, Christes substance of his flesh was neuer absent, since his incarnation: therefore it was not that which he desired, but another trueth of the olde figures, namely, the sacrifice of his death, of which the Apostle sayeth: Christ our Passeouer is slaine &amp; offered vp. 1. Cor. 5. Againe, where he saieth, his owne substance vnited to his godhead, is the onely meate wherein God taketh pleasure, he speaketh contrarie to Christ, which saith, My meate is to doe the will of my father, and finish his worke, which was brought to passe in his suffering, which also he nameth expressely in the wordes of ye preface. It was the last Passeouer, that hee did eate, before his suffering, so that this circumstance maketh nothing for the bodily presence.
                  
                     The sixt circumstance concerning the loue which moued Christ to institute this Sacrament. Sander.
                     
                  
                  Euen the same loue moued him, which moued him Fulke. to institute ye Sacrament of regeneration, neither in promising to giue his bodie, did he speake more, then he did perfourme. For he gaue his bodie in deede, and daily

giueth it to be receiued spiritually, vnder the sacrament of breade and wine. But that hee shoulde giue it by conuersion of the elements into his bodie and bloud, loue could not moue him to giue it otherwise, than as it might be most profitable for vs; and most honourable for him, &amp; that was to giue it, spiritually to be receiued.
                  
                     The seuenth circumstance of washing the Apostles feete. Sander.
                     
                  
                  
                     Because Christ washed his Apostles feete, the custome of the Church (saith he) hath bene, that all catholike Bishops and pri
                           •
                        si
                           •
                        
                      
                     Fulke. 
                     haue vsed before they came to consecrate, to wash the verie tops of their fingers, not to handle breade and wine, for then Christ might haue washed his disciples handes before they had eaten the Paschall Lambe, at the eating whereof was bread and wine, but cleane consciences were sufficient for eating of that bread &amp; wine, but the other must haue also the bodies purified, for the more worthie receiuing therof. This is newe diuinitiea, nd newe Logike also Christ washed his Apostles feete, therefore Bishops &amp; Priests vse to wash the toppes of their fingers before they consecrate, when it were more reason they should wash the peoples feete, who by his saying, must haue their bodies also purified for the more worthie receiuing This is a poore circumstance, to proue yt Christs words are not figuratiue.
                  
                     The eight circumstance, concerning the place of the last supper. Sander.
                     
                  
                  If the house in which Christ kept his Passeouer, had Fulk. been material, some of ye Euangelists would haue noted yt it stood in Zion, as well as Nicephorus &amp; Damascen, who could hardly know the place, seeing Ierusalem was vtterly destroyed long before their time, &amp; another city built, not standing in place of the old Ierusalem. That a great &amp; vnacustomed matter was done in the house, so found by miracle, we confesse, but that proueth not that Christs speech was proper, because it was not abroad in ye temple or synagogue, but in a close parlour. But where Sander saith, Christ gaue to euery one of his Apostles a

loafe, vnder the forme whereof, his owne substance was conteined, it is against y• scripture, which saieth, he brake the bread, he gaue them, against Cyrillus, which saith he gaue them pieces of bread, against reason, that euery one should eate a loaf of bread, although they wer but smal, when they had supped twise before in that euening, at ye Paschall Lamb, &amp; at an ordinarie supper. But if the table be real (saith Sander) much more the meat is reall. Wee denie not, but the meat is real: that is real bread &amp; wine to the bodie, and the bodie and bloud of Christ to be receiued of the soule: for, if al things be reall, why should not the bread and wine be reall?
                  
                     The ninth circumstance of the taking bread &amp; wine. Sander.
                     
                  
                  
                     Christ tooke bread &amp; wine, who neuer touched the thing which 
                     Fulke. 
                     he did not sanctifie. Yes, he touched Iudas lippes with his lippes, yet did he not sanctifie them. But he sanctified ye bread &amp; wine to the vse of his supper. Neither went the vertue from him (as Sander saieth) by touching of his garments, but by faith, for many at the same time, did not only touch him, but thrust &amp; throng him, yet they all receiued not vertue from him. Secondly, he tooke vnleauened bread, which was alreadie figuratiue bread: therfore he goeth not about to doe that was done alreadie, to make it figuratiue bread. I answer, the Paschall Lamb was eaten, and therefore the bread was common bread, although vnleauened, which was to be eaten seuen dayes after. But what letteth, if it once figured one thing, but that he might take it to make it a figure of an other thing? for Saint Paul sheweth that it figured sinceritie and trueth: nowe it is a seale of the remission of finnes, by the death of Christ.
                  
                     Thirdly, Christ taking bread and wine, pointeth not to his Apostles, as though he would consecrate somewhat in their breasts, (as Caluine dreameth) but in breade and wine, wee must seeke the first worke of his supper. And therefore, Sander dreameth, that Christ meant to consecrate nothing in the Apostles brestes. He begon with taking bread and wine, ergo he did worke nothing in the Apostles breastes. A sounde reason, I promise you.
                  
                     
Last of all, this putteth vs in minde of that great Priest Melchisedek, as Cyprian teacheth. But the Apostle writing to the Hebrues, could haue taught vs more certeinly, if he could haue seene any such comparison betweene Christ and Melchizedeck. Heb. 7. And euery sacrifice (saith he) is changed in substance from the former nature it had, sometime killed, sometime burned, sometime eaten: therefore Christ must change the breade &amp; wine into his bodie and bloud. If we should admitte a sacrifice (as most of the olde writers call the celebration of the supper a sacrifice of thankesgiuing) verily the change by eating and drinking, were sufficient to make it answere to the change required in a sacrifice, without transubstantiation, which was not vsed in any sacrifice.
                  
                     The tenth circumstance of blessing. Sander.
                     
                  
                  First, when Christ blesseth, it is not necessarie, that hee should make any outward token of lifting vp his eyes or Fulk. handes, and least of all, with making the signe of ye crosse, as Sander dreameth waking. And although, when he blesse, he speake, by the way of doing or best
                        ••
                     ing some reall benefite, it followeth not, but that his speach may be figuratiue, which is not alwayes imperfect, as Sander saith, but being well vsed, is better then comon speech. Although what blessing meaneth in this place, the other Euangelistes do declare, which call his blessing, thanksgiuing. And yet I denie not, but Christ blessed the bread and wine, which he sanctified, to be a diuine sacrament of his bodie and bloud, for the assurance of remission of sinnes, by the newe testament, which is established in his bloud.
                  
                     The eleuenth circumstance of giuing thankes.
                  
                  The best thankes (saith he) are those, that are giuen in Sander. worde and deede: therefore Christ gaue not thankes figuratiuely, Fulke. neither be the wordes of thankesgiuing figuratiue, as the Sacramentaries saye: The wordes in

which Christ gaue thankes, are not expressed, &amp; therefore ye Sacramentaries saie not that they are either figuratiue or proper. But Sander would haue these wordes, This is my bodie, to be the wordes of thankesgiuing, because Irenaeus saith, Panem, in quo gratiae act
                           •
                        e sunt, corpus esse domini, that the breade, in which thankes is giuen, is the bodie of our Lorde: as though thankes could not be giuen, but by those wordes onlie, which are not wordes of thankesgiuing to God, but of declaring to men, how to esteeme that which Christe giueth, namely as a true pledge of his bodie and bloud: as if one deliuering the broad seale to a condemned man, saie, this is a pardon for you. That Christ gaue thankes to God both in worde and deede, not onlie at this time, but at all times, there is no question: for in all things hee was obedient to his father, euen to the most curssed and shamefull death of the Crosse: neither was it necessarie, that he should make transubstantiation, so often as he gaue thankes in worde and deede. Neither are those our ancestors, which denied the sacrament of Eucharistie or thankesgiuing, of whom Ignātius spake: for wee both receiue it, and beleeue it to bee the fleshe and bloud of Christe, in such sense as hee meant it, and as Ignatius tooke his meaning.
                  
                     The twelfth circumstance of breaking. Sander.
                     
                  
                  First Sander findeth fault with the order of wordes Fulke. vsed by all the Euangelistes, in placing breaking, before the wordes of consecration, because Saint Paul sayeth the breade which we breake, is the communion of the bodie of Christ: which is no good argument: for Saint Paul thereby sheweth, that the bread is not altered from his substance, although it be vsed for a Sacrament of our spirituall communication of Christ with vs, and of vs one with another. 1. Cor. 10. But he will salue the matter, by saying, the Euangelistes first ioyne all the deeds of Christ together, and then expresse his wordes.
                  
                     
The deeds, he saith, are taking bread, blessing, thanksgiuing, deliuering: mark yt here he maketh blessing, &amp; thāks giuing to be only deeds, which imediatly before he affirmed to be by saying, This is my body. But howsoeuer our aduersaries are pleased wt all (saith he) let it go for a truth, that Christ did breake, and giue, after the words of consecration. Thus when he hath nothing to prooue it, a starke lye must goe for a truth, contrary to the order obserued by all the Euangelistes, because that order is contrary to Popery, and the Popishe custome, which first consecrateth, and then breaketh. But taking it for a truth: the breaking of that which appeared bread, doth shew Christ to be wholy conteined in euery piece thereof, whereas Christ eaten onely by faith, is receiued according to ye measure of euery mans faith, which is more or lesse, contrary to the figure of Manna. I answer, whole Christ is receiued by euery one, that receiueth the bread and wine in what quantitie soeuer, although Christ bestowe not his graces equally. For Christ doeth dwell in our hearts by faith: ergo he is wholy present by faith, Eph. 3.
                  And this meaneth Hieronyme in the place by Sander cited aduers. Iouin li. 2. after he had spoken of Manna. Et not &amp;c. And wee also take the bodie of Christe equally. There is one sanctification in the mysteries of the master and seruant, &amp;c. although according to the merites of the rec
                           •
                        iuers, that is made diuers, which is one. By merites, Hierom meaneth not workes, but worthines of faith, by which the grace of God is effectuall vnto good workes, in some more than in other. Neither hath Eusebius Emissenus aniething contrarie to this meaning, Homil. 5. in Pasch. Hoc corpus &amp;c. This bodie when the prieste ministreth, is as greate in the small peece, as in the whole loafe. Of this bread when part is taken, euery man hath no lesse, then altogether: one hath all: twaine hath all: moe haue all, without diminishing.
                  These words (saith Sander) cannot be vnderstanded

of materiall bread, nor of inward grace, neither of which are equally receiued. But yet Christ and a seale of this redemption is equally receiued, without change of the bread into Christ. For Eusebius speaketh of breade and a whole loaf, as Sander himselfe translateth, bread is not the name of accidentes, neither was there euer heard of a loafe of accidentes of bread: nor of breaking of accidentes of bread, before the Laterane Councell. But what saith Germanus Archb. of Constantinople? Post eleuationem, &amp;c. after the eleuation, by &amp; by, a partition of the diuine lody of is made. But truly although he be diuided into partes, yet he is acknowledged and found vndiuided, vncutt, and whole in euery parte of the thinges, that are cutt. Where he saith, the diuine body is parted, he meaneth the bread, which is called his body, for the Greekes to this day, doe not acknowledg transubstantiation. Although the authoritye of Germanus bee not worth the standing vpon, beeing but a late writer of a corrupt time.
                  But what speake I of fathers, saieth Sander? The breade which wee breake, is it not the communicating of our Lordes body? Because wee being many, are one bread, one body. For so much as wee all partake of the one breade. If the breade bee broken, (saith he) how partake wee all of one breade? that which is broken, is not one in number. No sir, but it was one in number before it was broken, whereof when euery one receiued a parte, wee vnderstand that wee all pertaine to one whole. But the Corinthians (saith he) haue more then one loafe broken among them. How prooue you that, sir? the wordes of Paul seeme otherwise, and if they had twentie loaues, yet was it al one bread in kind, wherof the Apostle saide, wee all partake of one breade: which if it be not materiall breade, how is it broken? for the body of Christ is not broken. And Saint Paul, saying wee partake all of one bread, which is broken, meaneth not yt the visible Sacrament, is nothing els but many accidentes, and no breade at all.
                  
                     
                        The thirteenth circumstance of giuing. Sander.
                     
                  
                  Sander will haue the words of consecration to goe before the deliuerie of the bread, contrary to the order of Fulke. all the Euangelistes: for else Christ should not giue a sacrament, and he promised to giue his flesh, &amp;c. I answere, he gaue a Sacrament, and his flesh at his supper, although the Sacrament were not perfect in euerie singular action that belonged to it, but in the whole. Where he sayeth, the meate of Christes supper came from his hands, and that it is horrible blasphemie, to say it came another way, because he onely sayeth it, it shall suffice plainly to denie it. He gaue bread and wine from his handes, but he gaue his flesh and bloud, from his eternall spirite, which giueth life vnto his fleshe, and the working of the holy ghost, the thirde person in Trinitie, maketh it to be effectuall, which God the father by his sonne Iesus Christe, giueth vs in his supper.
                  Nowe hee alleageth Saint Mathewe, Saint Marke, Saint Luke, and Saint Paul, which saye, he did giue with his handes, and seeing in Saint Iohn he had promised to giue his flesh to be eaten, what other perfourmance of his promise is there, then this gift by his hande? and here he asketh what other Gospell wee can bring forth, wherein Christ fulfilled at any time his promise there made? and here he craueth pardon to crye out vppon false preachers; Ye cruell murtherers of Christian soules, where is that meate giuen, but at Christes table, &amp;c? Thou false hypocrite and errant traytor, &amp; murtherer both of Christian bodies and soules, we haue no Gospell, but the Gospell of Christ, written by his Apostles and Euangelists. But thou contrarie to the order of all the foure witnesses, which thou namest, thou, I saye, defendest the giuing to be after the saying. And whereas they all saye, he gaue that hee tooke, and hee tooke the substance of breade, thou denyest that hee gaue the substance of bread.
                  Thirdly, where Christ sayeth, The bread which hee

will giue, is his flesh, which he wil giue for the life of the world, which was on ye crosse, thou affirmest, that hee giueth it only at his supper. And last of al, wheras he gaue presently, which then presently was eaten, when he said, he that eateth me &amp;c. thou restrainest his gift onely to his supper, wherin, although he gaue that before he promised, yet he gaue it not only there, nor first there, nor there with his hands, but with his spirite ioyning with his handes, that gaue the externall signes. For of giuing by hands onely, without his spirit, it may be truely said, The flesh profiteth nothing, Ioh. 6. And therfore the Apostle speaking of the oblation of Christes bodie on the crosse, saith, he offered himselfe by his eternall spirite. Heb. 9.
                  
                     The fourteenth circumstance of saying. Sander.
                     
                  
                  Wordes are vsed for profite, and for necessitie, therefore the wordes of God are greatly to be regarded, and Fulk. especially, the wordes concerning the sacrament, which is an hidden mysterie, and therefore hath neede to be declared by wordes: but the Sacramentaries looking to Christes deedes, as taking bread, &amp;c. trust not his words, saying, This is my bodie, testified by foure of his disciples. Yes master Sander, those whome you call Sacramentaries, trust them better, &amp; more certeinly beleeue them to be true, in that sense which Christe did speake them, than you popish transubstātiators do in your popish error, which to make your selues godmakers, of arrogancie and couetousnes, you defend among the ignorant. But deedes, except they be expounded by words (saith he) may haue many interpretations: And the deedes of the last supper, seeme to him to be vndoubted parables, which the words expounde, and therefore be no parables: for meere figuratiue words expound nothing. Who is so madd to grant to Sanders see

                     ings, that the deeds of Christ in taking bread, blessing, thankesgiuing, breaking, giuing, are parables? but ad
                     
                        •
                     itte they were parables, why may not meere figuratiue wordes, expound parables? Christ himselfe expoundeth

                  But he will bring a greater reason: the wordes of the supper, giue substance to the deedes, for no Sacrament can be made without wordes, ordeined of God.
                  If I should vrge this rule against fiue of your Sacramentes. I might easily prooue them to be no Sacraments, because they haue not wordes ordeined of God to giue substance of Sacraments to the externall deedes. Well, the worde of Sacrament (saith hee) must be common and knowen, therefore not figuratiue. I haue shewed often before, that Circumcision, and the Paschall Lambe were instituted by such figuratiue speeches, as these wordes, This is my body, This is my couenant. This is the Passeouer, baptisme is regeneration, &amp;c.

Our Lorde suffereth Iudas to receiue among the innocent disciples, that which the faithfull knowe, our price.

                  Against Sanders exposition of these wordes, our price to be nothing else, but the bodie of Christ, and not onely a Sacrament thereof, I oppose Augustine himselfe to expounde his owne meaning, who sayeth of the rest of the Apostles, and of Iudas, Illi manducabunt panem Dominum, ille panem Domini contra Dominum. In Fuan. Ioan. Tract. 59. They did eate the breade which was our Lorde, he did eate the breade of our Lorde against our Lorde.
                  
                     The sixteenth circumstance of eating. Sander.
                     
                  
                  Christ sayeth, eate ye once onely, meaning that they should eat bodily, that he gaue them, and eat it also spiritually. Fulke. This I allowe, for vnder the signe of bodily eating, 
                        •
                     e willed them to be assured of spirituall participation of his flesh and bloud and all benefites of his passion. But this will not satisfie Sander, but seeing hee sayth, eate ye, but once, hee would haue them to eate bodily the same substance, which they should eate spiritually, which is no good argument. And therefore hee is shamefully graueled when he saith, the verbe eate, by this meane, standeth not vnproperly (for hee can abide no figures) because eating, belongeth naturally, both to the soule &amp; the bodie, which would make

any Philosopher blush to heare, but the reason more: because the cause of eating principally belongeth to the soule, and the meane principally to the body, which hath instrumentes to eate; for a dead body can not eate, nor a soule without a body can eate properly. What say you Sander? is the soule the principall cause of eating, and the body the instrumentall cause? By this meanes the soule goeth, rideth, lieth, speaketh, leapeth, daunceth, and all whatsoeuer a dead man can not do. Well, grant then this speculation: what then? what other spirituall eating can be meant by this word eate ye, then by any other eating, for euery man eateth whatsoeuer he eateth, by this reason spiritually and bodily. Wherefore in spight of your nos

                     , if Christ commanded his Apostles to eat spiritually, as Christians vse to speake, and not according to your physicall argument, either he commanded it by an other worde, or els this worde is vnproper. For to eate by faith, is to eate vnproperly, and not to eate physically, as all other meats are eaten.

                     ion of that in question, for we

denie the Sacrifice pretended: yet Christ at other times, gaue thankes for bodily meate, much more nowe for spirituall food of the soule, as the Sacrament is, beeing worthily receiued.
                  As for Melchisedek his Sacrifice in breade and wine, we finde none that he offered to God, but a refreshing to Abraham, whome in deede he blessed as the Priest of God, and so hath Christ blessed vs with eternall happines. Therefore all this babling of Sander, that Christ offered bread and wine, to his father, which were all one as if a man should offer to a Prince a fatte Oxe, and giue him in a paper writen, this is a fat Oxe, &amp;c. is not worth one Goates heare. Christ offered but one Sacrifice propitiatorie, and that but once, shedding his bloud, the great mystery of which redemption, he deliuered to his Apostles in the outwarde creatures of breade and wine. But let vs see, howe he prooueth, that these wordes are not figuratiue.
                  First Ambrose saith: In the diuine consecration, the selfe wordes of our Lorde and Sauiour doe worke, and Chrysostome saith, that by this word, This is my body, the thinges set forth, are consecrated. but figuratiue wordes worke nothing, therefore they are not figuratiue. This minor is a starke lye often times confuted: These wordes in the very institution of the supper, are figuratiue, This is the new Testament in my bloud, and yet worke as much as these, This is my body. Likewise the wordes of Christ, are spirite and life, therefore not figuratiue, is a beastly argument, vnworthy answering, which wold denie al figuratiue speches to be ye words of Christ. As blockish and brockish it is, that in these 4. words Hoc est corpus meum, we leaue neuer a one in his own signification, plucking them from their gender and case, when we expound it thus: This doth signifie my body, which is a toy to mocke with an Ape. For who can expound a sentence in other wordes to keepe the same case, and gender, and kinde of wordes alwaies?
                  But it is a weighty matter, that Sander hath obserued

in Saint Paules order of wordes, placing the Pronowne 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      next to the Pronowne 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , vttering the wordes after this manner. This of me is the bodie: whereas the other Euangelistes say, This is the bodie of me. Verily, there is not here so much oddes, as betweene a milhorse, and an horsemill. But what is the great mysterie, that lyeth in this obseruation? forsooth it giueth coniecture (such as in the order of words may be had) that the Pronowne This, onely resteth and endeth his signification in the substantine Bodie, and cannot be referred vnto Bread. For it were an hard speech to say: this bread of me is the signe of bodie. But if I say, this bread doeth signifie of me the bodie, what other sense hath it, then if I saye, this bread doeth signifie the bodie of mee? I blame not Sander for scanning narrowly whatsoeuer is vttered in the scripture: but in vrging the composition of the Greeke speech, which is not like the English tongue, where there is no difference in sense, seeing the Latine composition w
                        •
                     l wel admitt that which soundeth hardly in the English speeche, Hic panis mei signum est corporis.
                  
                  
                     The eighteenth circumstance of these wordes, which Sander. is giuen for you.
                  
                  Sander playeth the foole out of measure, to vrge the Fulke. accidents of grammar in a figuratiue speech. Saint Luke sayeth, Hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis datur. If you take corpus figuratiuely (saith he) then the sense must be, Haec est figura corporis mei, quae pro vobis datur: This is the figure of my bodie, which figure is giuen for you, and so not his true bodie, but a figure thereof was giuen for vs. Sander thinketh he hath to do with young laddes, that learne their accidentes of grammar, which may perhaps wonder at his learned collections. But what if wee expound it thus, Hoc est corpus meum, id est, figura corporis mei (as Tertullian doeth) and reteining the gender of the Relatiue, say, quod pro vobis datur, This is a figure of my bodie, which bodie is giuen for you?
                  
                     
Sander hath his answere readie, that the relatiue must repete his whole antecedent, which cannot haue at once both a proper and vnproper meaning. What coulde Priscian, or Aristarchus haue vttered more learnedlie?
                  But when God saith in Gene. 17. Hoc est pactum meum quod obseruabitis inter me &amp; vos &amp;c. This is my couenant which you shall obserue betweene me and you: &amp;c. If pactum be taken for signum or sigillum pacti, the signe or seale of the couenant, as it must needes be, for circumcision, whereof he speaketh, was not the couenant, how doth the relatiue repete the whole antecedent? howe hath one word a proper and vnproper vnderstanding? Againe Exodus 12, Haec est religio phase, Omnis alienigena non comedet ex eo. This is the religion of the Passeouer, No straunger shal eate of it. Heere co is a relatiue agreeing in the newter gender, with phase his antecedent, and yet phase the passeouer, signifieth a Lambe, which was the signe of the passeouer. Againe when it is saide, Hoc est postr
                           •
                        mum pascha quod comedit Iesus cum discipulis: This is the last▪ passeouer that Iesus did eate, with his disciples: hath not quod the same relation which it hath in these wordes quod pro vobis datur? But to cut off all these nice questions of Grammar, what if the figure bee laide in the verbe est, after this manner, Hoc est, id est, significat corpus 
                           ••
                        um quod pro uobis datur, this signifieth my bodie which is giuen for you? Where is then our Aristarchus become with his antecedents, and relatiues? But hee hath founde another mystery in the Greeke worde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which must needes be reserred to corpus, and cannot be referred to figura corporis. And heere hee obtesteth, that he may be instructed, wherein he doth misconstrue the wordes. I haue already satisfied his requeste, and further I say, he doth without all Grammar, Rhetorike, Logike, Philosophie, and Diuinitie, referre hoc to corpus, which is to bee referred to that thing which hee had in his hande, which by their owne Popishe diuinitie could bee nothing but breade before hee had spoken out the wordes of consecration.
                  
                     
As for him that will lay the figure in the Verbe 
                        〈◊〉
                     , to take it for significat, Sander counteth him an ignorant man, because it must bee resolued by est significant, and then the reason of signifying shall be founde in the nowne (bodie) rather then in the verbe (Is:) for which cause Occolampadius admitted either ye one or the other that is est, for significat, or copus, for signum corporis. In deede the matter is not great, for the sense, but when you call vs to construing the words by Grammar: But taking the proposition thus: Hoc est significans corpus meum, I saye the reason of signifying consisteth not in the worde Bodie, but in the subiect of the proposition, which is the signe of the bodie, although significans followe the Verbe est: For the action of signifying pertaineth to the bread, the passion signified pertayneth to the bodie. Where Sander challengeth all the Grammarians in Christendome to finde another construction, I appeale to all the Grammarians in the worlde, whether these wordes, Hoc est corpus meum quod provobis datur, may not be construed grammatically, as wel as these other examples out of Genesis, Exodus, and a thousand more of like, that might be added.

For euerie thing that he did, was the best, in all respects, that he did it. But to prooue that facere signifieth sometime to offer sacrifice, he quoteth two places of Scripture, but reherseth neither of both for shame: the first 3 Reg. 18. Where Elias saith to the Baalites, ego faciam bouem alterum: Where facere signifieth not to offer sacrifice, but to prepare or dresse, or make ready an oxe; or at the least, is taken for interficere, to kill an oxe, which afterwarde is laide on the wo

The other place Leu. 15. is of two turtle Doues, faciet vnum pro peccato, &amp; alterum in holocauslum, he shall prepare the one for a sinne offering, and the other to be a burnt offering, where facere signifieth, as before, to make readie by killing, drawing washing, and dressing as the Lawe prescribed. The same Hebrewe verbe

                        nam, or some such like worde. But in our texte the circumstance of deedes and words (saith he) do make it so to signifie. First because the 14. day at euening hee began the blessed sacrifice of his passion. Secondly, hee hath offered the olde Paschal Lambe, the chiefe sacrifice of the Lawe. These two circumstances, shew it was time to go about his only sacrifice on ye crosse, they proue not yt he offered another sacrifice at ye table. Thirdly hetoke breade and wine into his handes, part of the sacrifice of Melchisedek. I answere, the scripture telleth vs not of any such sacrifice of Melchisedek. Fourthly, he blessed and gaue thankes, wherein he consecrateth his owne bodie, the onely sacrifice of mankinde. I answere, his owne bodie had no neede of consecration: hee consecrated breade to bee a sacrament of his bodie, which was not the onely sacrifice for mankind, which was but once and no more offered, or to be offered. Not that he should oftentimes offer vp himselfe, saith the Apostle. Heb. 9. ver. 25. wherefore his commaundement hoc facite, doe this, is

not to make a sacrifice of Christs bodie, which hee made not. But Cyptian (saith Sander) taketh the verbe facere so, lib. 2. Ep. 3. Iesus Christus &amp;c. Iesus Christ our Lord and God himself is the hiest priest of God the father, and first hath offered sacrifice vnto God the father, Et hoc fieri 
                              〈◊〉
                            sui commemorationem praecepit, and hath commaunded this thing to be done in his remembrance. That fieri signifieth heere not offerri, but generally hath relation to all yt Christ did: not onely the whole argument of the Epistle which was against ministring with water onely, but also the verie wordes following, which Sander hath fraudulently cut off, declare sufficiently, 
                        vtique ille saccrdos vice Christi verè fungitur qui id quod Christus fecit, imitatur &amp;c: Verily that Priest doth truely supply the roome of Christ, which imitateth that which Christ hath done: and then he offereth a true and full sacrifice to God the father in the Church, if he so begin to offer, according as he may see Christ himselfe to haue offered. Nay, that Cyprian meaneth not that Christ in his supper did offer his owne bodie in sacrifice to his father, for redemption of he worlde, but onely a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, and commaunded the same to bee kept in remembrance of his passion. Cyprian himselfe testifieth in the same Epistle. 
                        Et quia passionis eius mentionem in sacrificijs omnibus facimus (passio est enim domini sacrificium quod offerimus) nihil aliud quàm quod ille fecit facere debemus. And because wee make mention of his passion, in all sacrifices (for the sacrifice which wee offer, is the passion of our Lorde) wee ought to doe nothing, but that which hee himselfe did.
                  
                  Note heere the sacrifice which Cyprian offered, was the passion of Christ: as well as the bodie of Christ, but it was not the passion of Christ properly, therefore it was not the bodie of Christ properly. I might alleage other places out of that Epistle, to refell the impudencie of Sander: but this is sufficient, that neither facere in Cyprian, signifieth to sacrifice, neither the bodie of Christ was otherwise sacrificed of him, then as it suffered in his sacrifice.

                        Sander.
                     
                  
                  Christ saith, doe, or make this thing, or as Haymo Fulke. saith. Make this bodie, for he saith not, sic facite, doe so, but hoc facite, doe or make this thing: I haue answered sufficiently this making in the first booke, where Sander findeth fault with our translation, wherevnto I adde that which Cyprian writeth, in the Epistle last mentioned. Nam si in sacrificio quod Christus est, non nisi Christus sequendus est, vtique id not obaudire &amp; facere oportet, quod Christus fecit, &amp; quod faciendum esse mandauit, cùns ipse in Euangelis suo dicat, si feceritis quod mando vobis, iam non dico vos seruos sed amicos. &amp;c. If in the sacrifice which is Christ, none but Christ is to bee followed: verily that wee ought to obey and to doe, which Christ did, and commaunded to bee doone, seeing hee himselfe saieth in his Gospel, if you shall doe that which I commaunde you, nowe doe I not call you seruants, but friendes. In this saying, Cyprian referreth the verbe facere, to all thinges that Christ did, and not to making his bodie. But if wee shoulde graunt facere to signifie onely to make, yet coulde Sander get no more of vs by making, but a sacrament of his bodie: yet for his exposition, hee saieth, hee hath Iustinus Printed by Robert Steuens at Paris, Anno Dom. 1551. where hee writeth thus. The Apostles in their commentaries which are called Gospels, haue deliuered, that Iesus gaue them thus in commaundemēt, who when he had taken bread, and giuen thanks, said, Doe and make this thing, for the remembrance of mee

                  First Sander hath put in more wordes then Iustinus, for hee hath

of the institution, he rehearseth the verie words of Christ. This is my bloude, wherefore there is no doubt, but lustinus telling what Christ saide, doth not onely rehearse these wordes, Doe this in remembrance of me, but also these: This is my bodie, and so haue all the translato

This processe therefore declareth, what Christe said, as wel in the one part, as in the other, and therefore excludeth the vaine cauillation of Sander, grounded vpon a letter missing in one print, which in other copies is not omitted, as all the translations declare.

                        Sander. for the remembrance of me.
                  
                  The ende of the institution was the remembrance of Christes death, but that is best remembred by the Fulke. presence of him selfe, ergo he is really present: for Christe would make the best remembrance that could be. I answere, Christe saith in the remembrance of me, and not onelie of his dying, but of me dying and redeeming. It is against the nature of recordation, or hauing in minde, to haue the thing remembred actually present, &amp; therefore Christ ordained the best memorial that could be reteining the nature of recordation, and considering other circumstances to be considered, as he did in al tokens yt euer he made, which were ye best that could be deuised, for God in al things doth ye best: wherfore this reasō of Sand,

would proue ye reall presence of Christ in all sacraments, yt were before his incarnatiō, as wel as in this. And whereas Chrysostome saieth, Christ himselfe is daily set before vs, that we shoulde not forget him: he meaneth as saint Paul to the Galathians, where he saith, he was crucified among them, and to the Corinthians, saying: his glorie shewed vnto vs, with vncouered face which is by doctrine, more cleare then the figures of the Lawe. Gal. 3. 2. Cor. 3. and not in the Sacrament onely. Last of all, whereas a potte of Manna, was commaunded to be reserued for a memoriall, vnto the children of Israel, with what breade the Lord had fedde their fathers in the wildernesse, to prooue that a thing may be the remēbrance of it selfe: I answere, that it is nothing like. For there a part of that visible foode was reserued, for a sensible token of remembrance, not of it selfe, but of that which was eaten being of the same kinde. But in this sacrament, there is no such matter, except wee shoulde beleeue the tales of a bloudie finger seene in the patten &amp;c. as a part of the whole bodie, &amp;c. and the Papistes confesse, that Christ is not sensiblie present, as that Manna was.
                  
                     The 22. circumstance of these words, drinke yee all of this. Sander.
                     
                  
                  They all dranke of one cuppe, Iudas and al (saith hee) Fulke. for if two or three had drunke vp all, either Christ must haue consecrated the cuppe againe, or the rest must haue receiued a drinke not consecrated, as they do in Englande, when one cuppe is drunke vp, an other is filled out of a prophane potte, that standeth by: therefore this circumstance doth shewe, that more then wine is drunke. This conclusion shalbe graunted, of them that drinke worthily, without this circumstance, and of them that drinke vnworthily also, for they drinke iudgement to themselues. But concerning consecration, Sander imagineth it to be a magicall murmuring of wordes ouer yt wine which is present in one cuppe. Whereas the consecration of Christ, and the ministers of England, is a dedicating

to the holy vse of the supper, of so much bread and wine, as shalbe occupied in the celebration, and neither more nor lesse. But because he saith, it is not the will of Christ, that one Priest should consecrate in one ma

                     eany more then once, each kinde of the sacrament, because Christ dyed but once, and then both kinds together, because his bloud and soule must be signified, apart from his flesh and bodie. I aske him what large cuppe they had, or howe often in a day they said masse in the time of Leo, bishop of Rome, when a great Cathedral Church, as bigge as Paules Church in London, was diuerse times in one day filled with communicants? Leo Ep. 79. I meruaile what vessell of wine was consecrated to serue them all, if it be necessarie to haue it in one cuppe when it is consecrated, as Sander seemeth to affirme, or else howe manie cuppes they had standing on the table, that could suffice so great a multitude, that all must drinke of the bloud of Christ, though there be diuers chalices which hold it, when the people are manie as Sander saith, I doubt not, vnderstanding the bloude of Christ sacramentally: but I meruaile wt what face he can reprooue our ministration with prophane wine, if we did minister so as he slandreth vs, when hee and his fellowes doe altogether rob the people of the sacrament of Christes bloude, and giue them nothing but prophane wine.
                  
                     The 23. circumstance of these wordes, this Sander. is my bloude.
                  
                  Because it is in the common vulgar translation, Hic est 
                     Fulke. 
                     sanguis meus, Sander maketh not a litle adoe, that hic can agree with none, but sanguis: but when the Greeke is

                      this cup, that is the wine in this cuppe: for bloude it cannot be, before the words of consecration, if they will holde their owne principles. And therefore the best interpreters, to take away cauilling, turne it, Hoc est sanguis meus, This

thing is my bloud, as this thing is my body, where est may still stand for significat. And yet I denie not, but hic est sanguis and haec est caro, may well be vsed, as Cyprian doth in the same sense: for a relatiue betweene two antecedents, or an adiectiue betweene two substantiues of diuerse genders, may agree with either of them without any change of the sense, as in Genesis. Cap. 2. Adam saith of the woman: Hoc nunc os ex ossibus meis &amp; caro de carne mea, haec vocabitur virago. This is nowe bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, she shalbe called woman. Here the Pronoune is of both the genders, and yet there was conuersion of a bone into a woman. Likewise God speaking of the Rainebowe, which is there the Masculine gender, Gen. 9. saith: hoc est signum foederis, where hoc agreeth with signum, yet the sense is hic arcus est signum, this bowe is the signe. Absolom. Sam. 2. Cap. 18. erected a piller, called in the vulgar translation ti

                        lum, which is of the masculine gender, and thereof saith: Hoc erit monimentum nominis, this shalbe the moniment of my name, meaning this pillar, and yet hoc agreeth not in gender with it. I might multiply examples, infinitely, if these were not sufficient to shewe the vanitie of Sander, which of the gender of the pronowne, would prooue the speach not to be figuratiue. Where hee saith, we builde a roofe without walls or foundation, as Hierom saith of heretikes, that neglecting ye literal sense, builded al their fantasies vpon allegories: I answere, we doe not so but rather the Papists, which builde a sacrament without an element, denying breade and wine to remaine in the supper, as for the literall sense of scripture, we beleeue to be the onely true sense, although the words many times bee vnproper and figuratiue, euen as Sander himselfe both in his rotten Rocke, and in this booke taketh, this to be the literall sense of these words, I will giue thee the Keyes of the kingdome of heauen, meaning authoritie.
                  What the new testament is whereof the holy Sander. scripture speaketh.
                  A testamēt (he saith) is a solemn ordeining of a thing by Fulke.
                     
words confirmed by death of the testator, dedicated with a sacrifice, offered to God bloudily. The newe Testament is a couenant or truse made by Christ with vs, to haue forgiuenesse of sinnes, if we keepe his lawe. The bloude of the old Testament was put in a basen, the bloude of the newe Testament in a Chalice. I omit, that hee saith, the promise of the old Testament was but of a temporall inheritance, for keeping the lawe. But to returne to the newe Testament, which he so handleth, that there is neither rime nor reason in his argument. Three things (saith hee) are required in a solemne Testament, the couenant, bloudshedding, and application of the bloude. When Christ saieth, This is my bloude of the newe testament, either all these, or one of these may bee called the newe testament. But when saint Luke, and saint Paul reporte Christ to haue saide, This cuppe is the newe testament in my bloud, they seeme (saith hee) to take the worde Testament, for the substance of the thing which doth confirme the new testament, &amp; not properly for the newe truse or promise thereof. What say you, Sander? is there any vnproper speech in the words of consecration? is a substance expressed by the name of an accident? where be the nownes, pronownes, verbs, &amp; paticiples; where be the relatiues, antecedents, cases and genders, that fight for the proper sense of hoc est corpus meum? why serue they not heere? But heare a little more. This that is in the Chalice (saith he) is not the promise of remitting sinnes, but it is ye new testament in Christes bloud: That is to say, it is the thing that confirmeth the newe lawe. Why sir? euen now you told vs that it might be called a new testament, as it is a law, couenant, or promise. Will you make vs beleeue, that the Euangelistes reporting one saying of Christ, which can haue but one sense, in the one of them the newe testament is taken for a promise; in the other it is not taken for a promise? But let it bee the thing that confirmeth the promise: what thing is that I pray you? His bloud, you will say. Why then, the sense of these words, the newe testament in my bloude, is my bloude in my bloude. This cuppe is my bloude in my bloude: What sense is this? But Sedulius

I trow helpeth you much in 1. Co. 11. Ideo colix &amp;c. Therfore the Chalice is called the testament, because it did beare witnesse that the passion should bee soone after, &amp; now it testifieth that it is done: although you are faine to alter the common reading, &amp; to put in testamentum for testamenti. How prooue you by these wordes, that Sedulius was of your minde? Alas he hath nothing to say, but being taken with a figuratiue speach, he slinketh away like a Dogge that is whipped, with his taile betweene his legges. For these wordes of Christ, This cuppe is the newe testament in my bloude: if all the Grammarians in the worlde haue them in hande, to construe, cannot haue a Grammaticall sense, but must needes bee taken figuratiuely, and being so taken, chaseth transubstantiation out of the doores, for the true sense of them can be none other, but this. This cuppe is a seale of the newe testament established in my bloude, which is shed for the remission of sinnes, and the like vnderstanding must needes be of these words, This is my bodie.

                     t confirmeth the newe testament, but that is reall bloude, Fulke. therefore this is reall bloude, saith Sander. I answere, the argument is naught, because in one proposition, the speach is figuratiue, in the other proper. But he replieth, that the olde testament, had none other thing to signifie the bloude thereof, but the bloude of Calues, therefore the newe testament hath nothing but the bloude of Christ. I answere, the bloude of Calues and Goates was it selfe a figure of the bloude of Christe, by which the newe testament is confirmed, and therefore, there was no figure of that bloude to bee made. Heb. 9.
                  But S. Luke and S. Paul, by reciting the words otherwise, doe so euidently name bloud in the proper signification, that no reasonable man will say, that the name

of bloude standeth figuratiuely for the signe of bloude, saying, this cuppe is the newe testament in my bloude. In deede I confesse in this sentence, the worde bloud, signifieth properly, the bloude of Christ, shedde vpon the crosse, which is that bloude which answereth the bloud of the olde Testament and not that which is in the Chalice. But then the former wordes: This cup is ye newe testament, are figuratiue, for in proper manner of speaking the cuppe was not, 
                        •
                     e is not, the new testament, but a sacrament or signe thereof, which newe testament was confirmed by the bloude of Christe powred forth in sacrifice vpon the crosse. This one sworde is sufficient to cut the throate of transubstantiation &amp; carnall presence: for as much as Saint Luke and Saint Paul, giue the true sense of these wordes, This is my bloude, which is shedde for you, which in effect is thus much to say, this is the sacrament or seale of the newe testament established by shedding of my bloude on the crosse. But Sander can see nothing in Saint Luke and Saint Paul, but bloude taken properly, whereby he woulde prooue, that in the speech reported by the other Euangelists, bloud should not be taken figuratiuely, which is as good an argument as this. Bloud in the exposition of a figuratiue speech, is taken properly, therefore in figuratiue speech it selfe, it is not taken figuratiuely.
                  
                     The 25. circumstance, of these wordes: This

                  The cuppe (saith he) is named to shewe the manner Fulke. of fulfilling the olde figures, in which the bloud was put in a cuppe, as Chrysostome and Oecumenius affirmed, and presently sprinkled. I deny not that the cup might shewe the manner of fulfilling the old, figures of sprinkling of bloude in the sacrifices, but that was referred to the passion of Christ, and not to the sacrament, for those bloudie sacrifices, were figures of Christs bloudie sacrifice, in which was fulfilled whatsoeuer they did signifie, and not in the supper. The supper, as Augustine sayeth

of all our Sacraments, is diuerse in signe, but equall in signification, with those auncient Sacraments in Ioan. Tra. 26. The putting of bloud in the ba
                        •
                     en, did not shew the powring of wine into the cuppe, as Sander trifleth, but they both did signifie the powring foorth of the bloud of Christ vppon the crosse. But Oecumenius saith, that in steede of the bloud of beastes, our Lorde giueth his owne bloud, and that well in a cuppe, that hee might shewe the olde Testament to haue shadowed this thing before. I answere, that Occumenius a late writer, to whose authoritie I am not bound, of the Sacrament, speaketh sacramentally, ascribing to the signe, that which is proper to the thing signified. Otherwise, there is nothing in his writing to warrant transubstantiation.
                  
                     The 26. circumstance of the verbe est, left out in S. Lukes words. Sander.
                     
                  
                  Saint Luke leaueth out the verbe 
                        •
                     s, according to the Fulk. phrase of the Hebrewe tongue, what verbe will you bring in his place? (saith he) the verbe significat you cannot, because 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is the Nominatiue case, then must you needes haue the verbe est: but as soone as it is in his place, shal it immediatly be cast out and changed into the verbe significat, &amp;c?
                  And here he amplifieth ye matter with such eloquence as Rhetorike wil aford him. But when you haue spoken your pleasure of taking in, and casting out, of compulsion &amp; enforcements, of verbs substantiue and adiectiue &amp;c. I pray you, what great piaculum is it, if being compelled to take in the verbe substantiue to make perfect the grammaticall sense, we be also enforced to vnderstand est for significat, to make good the logical sense? And how in Gods name doe you vnderstande the verbe substantiue est, in these wordes of Saint Luke: This cup is the newe Testament, in your 23. circumstance, when you expound it so, that you say, that which is in the cup, is not the newe Testament, which is the newe truce or couenant of remitting sinnes, but the thing which witnesseth it to be confirmed? You will say, the figure is in the words newe Testament, and not in the verbe es
                           •
                        .
                     
Then must I sett vpon you, with your owne weapons which you fight with all in ye 18. circumstance. I would faine see the brasen face of Sander, with what countenance he would defend this shamlesse stuffe.
                  
                     The 27. circumstance of these wordes, which is shedde for you.
                  
                  This cuppe is the new Testament in my bloud, which Sander. is shedd for you, saieth S. Luke. Here (saith Sander) the Fulke. relatiue, which, is referred to the Nowne Cuppe, and not to the Nowne Bloud, because 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is the nominatiue case, and can not agree with 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which is the datiue case, wherefore the sense must be the cuppe, that is, that which is in the cuppe, was shedd for vs. but the onely reall bloud of Christ was shedde for the remission of our sinnes, therefore the onely reall bloud of Christ was conteined in the cuppe. And heere he asketh what answere can be framed to this argument, if hell were lett loose. To the grāmaticall construction I haue answered sufficiently, in confutation of his rotten rocke of the Romish Church, vnto the g. his 9. marke of an Antichristian. That if he wil neither admit the coniecture of Beza, that those wordes might, by error of the writers, be taken into the text, nor that S. Luke vseth the figure of Soloecophanes, in that place, as in diuerse other: yet at the lest, that the article prepositiue standeth for ye relatiue 
                        〈◊〉
                     , as often it doth, and that the verbe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is here vnderstoode, being left out as in the former part of ye sentence, For howsoeuer it be, it can not be translated nor vnderstood thus: This cuppe, that is to say this bloud, which is shedde for you, is the newe Testament in my bloude. For what sense can these wordes haue? This bloud is the newe Testament, and this bloud is in my bloud. And nowe to the argument in which seing he vnderstandeth the speech to be proper, I denie the maior or proposition. This liquor in the cuppe of Christes banket was shedde for vs, and I prooue it to be false euen by the wordes of Christ vttered by S. Luke and S. Matthew. The fruite of the vi
                        •
                     e was not shedd for vs, the liquor in the cuppe of Christs banket, was the fruite of the vine: therefore the

liquor in ye cuppe of Christes banket was not shed for vs. That Euthymius a late gatherer, referreth these wordes of shedding for vs, to the cuppe, I force not, and yet hee meaneth the cuppe to be his bloud not really, but Sacramentally, euen as his bloud is not there shedde really, except the Papistes will now giue ouer their old distinction of vnbloudy Sacrifice, to saye that the bloud of Christ is shedd forth in the Sacrament, as Sander saieth it was presently shedde in a mysterie, and the next daye shedde naturally. What misty speech is this? The naturall bloud of Christ is shedde in a mystery, if we speake after that manner, the reall body and bloud of Christ is present in a mysterye, eaten and drunken in a mysterye, &amp;c. he crieth out that we build a roofe without a foundation of the naturall maner of presence and receiuing. But he must be admonished that the Greek word is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , signifying which is shedd forth, and simply shedd, and therfore the word hath relation to the bloud which in his passion was shedde forth of his bodie. which shedding forth of his bodye, if Sander will confesse to be in his Masse, he must vtterly renownce the vnbloudy Sacrifice, so much prated of among the Papistes, for what els is a bloudy Sacrifice, but that whereof the bloud is powred out or shedde forth?
                  
                     The last circumstance of the hymne saide at Christes supper.
                  
                  We neuer read of any hymne saide or song after any Sander. feast, but this, and yet Christ gaue himselfe by faith and Fulk. spirite at the supper time, to some of his disciples, before that night as to S. Marie at Bethanie, Ioan. 12. therfore the hymne externally song or saide, was dewe to this externall worke of God, wherein with his owne handes, he gaue his owne body and bloud, &amp;c. Because Sander confesseth that this circumstance aboue doth not prooue the reall presence, I will take his confession, It may not be denied but that Christ song or saied the hymne at other times, although it be expressed but this once. And if it were certeine, that this was the first and last that he song with them, yet there might be greate and sufficient cause

of his ioyfull thankesgiuing at this time, wherein hee made an ende of the old ceremonie, and hauing instituted a newe sacrament of thankesgiuing, was euen the same night to beginne his passion, which was the principall caufe of his cōming into the world for the redemption of mankinde. As for these circumstances which hee confesseth, doe not euerie one by them selfe prooue the reall presence: when hee can make an argument of them altogether able to proue it, I wil take in hand to answer it. In the meane time, as he hath set them down seuerally, I haue answered, that neuer a one of them hath ani force of argument to proue that he entendeth by them.
               
               
                  CAP. X.
                  
                     The reall presence of Christes bodie and bloud, and the proper meaning of his words, is proued by the cōferēce of holie scriptures, Sander. taken out of the newe testament, and speaking of our Lords supper.
                  
                  The places that he will conferre, are three: first, Iohn. 6. The breade which I will giue, is my fleshe: and my Fulke. fleshe is meate indeede. The second, Math. 26. Take, eate, this is my bodie, and, this cuppe is the newe testament in my bloude. The thirde, 1. Cor. 10. The chalice of blessing which wee blesse, is it not the communicating of Christs bloud▪ And the breade which wee breake, is it not the communicating of the bodie of our Lord? Of these sentences Sander will conferre euerie word together which is not the right order of conference of scripture, to conferre the wordes whereof some are proper, some are figuratiue: but to conferre the Logicall sense of diuers places together, which either are both manifest in their seueral senses, or else may be made open by the circumstances of the places. But to folowe Sanders conference. In the first sentence he saith, The bread which I will giue, is described in the supper, by these wordes, Take, eate (this:) and in S. Paul is called, The breade which wee breake. But I vtterly denie, that the wordes of Christ in Saint Iohn, are all one with those of the supper. And therefore the referring of this to an eateable thing or foode &amp;c is not shewed by that conference. But S. Paul and Christ. Matth. 26. speake in deede both of one

matter, namely by the sacrament: Christ in S. Iohn speaketh of that meate which tarrieth to life euerlasting, but the sacramentall meate doth not so: for according to the earthly parte of it, as Origen affirmeth, it goeth the same way that all other meates doe. 
                        Ille cibus qui sanctificatur, &amp;c. That meate which is sanctified by the word of God and prayer, according to that which it hath material, goeth into the bellie, and is cast out into the dunghill, Origen, in Matth, cap. 15.
                      And according to the heauenly part which is the body of Christ, by the Papists confession, it tarieth not in the wicked, nor in the godly in substance, but in effect as Sander tolde before, therefore Christ in S. Iohn speaketh not of the sacramentall meate.
                  Secondly, the breaking of the bread, which is done before the wordes which the Papistes account the onely wordes of consecration can shewe the pronowne this, to signifie no materiall substance but breade: although Sander affirme, the breaking to be after, because it is so vsed in the popish Masse. Againe when the Apostle saith the bread which we break, he speaketh plainly of a thing that is broken actually, but so is not the body of Christ: as for Sanders shift of that foode, and that eatable thing, which we breake, is but a cloake of words, for if yt foode be the natural bodie of Christ, and that foode is naturally broken, then the naturall bodie of Christ, is naturally and really broken. Last of all, ye conference of this and this cuppe, to prooue that this, meaneth generally ye substance vnder this, is not worth a chippe, for these wordes this cuppe, do not meane a generall metaphysicall substance, but the wine in this cuppe which is also called the fruit of the vine, and therfore This in the other saying, signifieth yt substance only, which was in his hand, which was bread, and by their owne doctrine could be no other substance but bread, before hoc est corpus meum were saide all out, ouer it. The verbe, is, in the words of Christ, The bread which I will giue, is my flesh, although it respect the naturall flesh of Christ, yet it prooueth not, that the verbe, is, in the supper must be referred to the sonne, more then the same verbe in Saint Paul the Rocke was Christ: yet because you may see what a foolish

conference Sander maketh of wordes, I will reason with him in his owne sense, and ouerthrowe him in his owne conference.
                  I say not (saith Sander) that the bread shalbe, but the bread is my flesh. If the bread is his flesh, then his flesh is the bread: and if the worde, bread, signifie an eatable thing, as we haue bene often told, then ye flesh of Christ is an eatable thing, when he so saith: and consequently, the flesh of Christ, which he said he would giue for the life of the world, might be eaten before the institution of ye Sacrament. The word cōmunicating, is the next matter of conference, which being vsed of S. Paul, doeth interprete the verbe Is, to signifie a substantiall, and not an accidentall being: for communicating doeth shewe, that all thing is common betweene it and Christes flesh: no diuision, no separation, no distinction commeth betweene these two, but a bar
                           •
                         signe of bread can make no such communicating, because it is cleane of another kinde, &amp;c. That Sanders argument may be the stronger, he disputeth against that often times, which wee vtterly denie. For we neuer saide, that naturall bread or a bare signe, can make vs to haue communion with Christ, but the verie bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, yet not corporally but spiritually ioyned vnto vs, of which communicating, the bread and wine are effectuall seales &amp; sacraments. As for Sanders assertion, of communicating to signifie all thing common betwene Christ and vs, not only without diuision, but euen with out distinction, is horrible heresie, and detestable blasphemie. Saint Iohn, Ep. 1. Cap. 1. vseth the same worde often, saying, that wee haue 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      communicating with God the father, and his sonne Iesus Christ, haue wee then all thing common with God the father, so that ther is no distinction betweene vs and him? O intollerable blasphemie! The same Apostle saith, wee haue 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      communicating one wt another, by which he not only sheweth, that the worde of communicating, signifieth not all that which Sander saith it doeth: but also teacheth, that our communicating with Christ, and with ye members of Christ, is spirituall, whereof S. Paul speaketh,

1. Cor. 10. We being manie, are one bodie, &amp;c. And last of all, that wee haue this 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      or communicating by other meanes then by receiuing the Sacrament. That wee haue seene and heard, saieth Saint Iohn, wee preach vnto you, that you also may haue communicating with vs, &amp; that our communicating may be with the father and with his sonne Iesus Christ. Againe, if we walke in the light, as he is light, we haue communicating one with another, and the bloud of Iesus Christ his sonne, doeth purge vs from all sinne.
                  The last wordes of conference, are bodie and bloud, for which he heapeth vp so many texts, as they are named in, and more then either they are named &amp; meant in, to proue that bodie and bloud stand not for signe or figure of bodie and bloud, and in the ende concludeth, that because these wordes are taken properly, therefore, to defend the wordes of Christes supper to be figuratiue, is ignorance in Grammar and Logike, blindnesse in diuinitie, malice inexcusable in the day of iudgement. But so long as it is but Sanders sophisticall conclusion, it is little to be regarded. what Logike, diuinitie, or conscience he hath that reasoneth thus, let all the Logicians, diuines, and men of good conscience consider, vntill Christ come and iudge all things. The worde bodie in this saying: This is my bodie, is not figuratiue, therefore the whole saying is not figuratiue. This, signifieth a generall thing, and not that thing in his hand: Is, declareth that to be presently, which is not vntill all the wordes be said: bodie, is taken properly: Therefore the sense of this whole saying, vttered together, cannot be figuratiue. But nowe we shall see conference of other places of scripture. It is euident (he saith) that Iohn is not Elias, and vseth many arguments to proue it: yet will he admitte no arguments out of the present words, This is my bodie, to prooue that the saying is figuratiue, as well as, This is Elias. And yet there is more oddes betweene the bodie of Christ, and naturall bread, then (hee saith) is manifest betweene Iohn and Elias. Secondly, The rocke was Christ, must needes be figuratiue,

because it speaketh of two diuerse natures: as though bread and ye body of Christ were not two diuerse natures. But there is no conuersion of any rocke into Christ: for Christ did neither say of the rocke, This is my body, nor cōmand vs so to say. Seeing the holy ghost saieth, the rocke was Christ: who doubteth, but that it was so by the word of Christ, although not expressed by Moses? And seing the Apostle speaketh so, in the time past, who will denie but that Moses or any man by the authority of Gods wordes, at such time as the Israelites did drinke of it, might haue said of the rocke: This is Christ?
                  The other places which proue, ye absence of Christ in his humane nature frō the world, as the poore ye shall haue alwaies, but me you shall not haue alwaies, He is risen, he is ascended into heauen, he sitteth at the right hand of God, &amp;c. Sander saith, they denie not his inuisible presence in the Sacrament, nether is any thing impossible to God, and Christ sitting in heauen is almighty, &amp;c. But Christ doth not only tell his Apostles, yt they shal see him no more after his ascension, saying, I goe to my father, and you shal see mee no more, Iohn 16. ver. 10. but also he telleth them plainely, and without any parable, as they confesse, that he leaueth the world and goeth to his father. Io. 16. ver. 20. whereas if he had saied, I departe out of the worlde, when he onely departed out of sight, and purposed still to be present inuisibly, he had not spoken plainely, but very darkely. Whereas Chrysostom de sacerd. lib. 3. saith, it is a great miracle, that he which sitteth with his father in heauen, at the same instant is touched with the handes of all men, and deliuereth him selfe to those that will touch and embrace him. It is manifest, he speaketh of the heauenly mystery figuratiuely. For immediatly before he saith: when thou seest turbam circumfusam, pretioso illo sanguine intingi ac rub
                              •
                           fieri, &amp;c. the people standing about to be dipped and made redde with that precious bloud: doest thou thinke thou art still among mortall men, and standest vpon the earth? Art thou not rather immediatly remoued into the heauens? Doest thou not casting away

all cogitation of flesh, with naked soule and pure minde, looke rounde about vpon those thinges that are in heauen? These wordes declare plainelye, that Chrysostome dreamed not of transubstantiation, but spake of a spirituall handling and receiuing of Christ, as of a spirituall dipping and making redde the people with his pretious bloud, and of feeding on Christ in heauen by faith. And so it is more wonderfull, that wee in body remaining on the earth, doe feede on Christ sitting in heauen, not by bringing him downe vnto vs, but by lifting vs vp vnto him. The places of scripture that Sander quoteth, as perteining to the supper, although they all pertaine not vnto it, yet when he can make any argument out of any of them for his carnall manner of presence, I shall easily answere it.
               
               
                  CAP. XI.
                  
                     Why the Sacrament is called breade Sander. after consecration
                  
                  If Master Sander had first prooued, that the Sacrament Fulk. is not bread after consecration, wee might easily haue yelded to the reason that might be brought why it is called, that which in nature it is not. As wee can yeld many reasons, why the Sacrament is called the body of Christ, although it be not the body of Christ in the nature of it: yet it is meete, that first wee prooue that it is not his body after that manner, that the Papistes defend, and then shewe reasons why it is called by the name of that which it doth signifie. But let vs heare Sanders reasons.
                  First the Hebrue tongue, which the Euangelists &amp; Apostles writing Greek, doth follow, vseth ye name bread for all maner of food. Secondly, a thing is called by the name of yt which it was, and not which it is, as Aarons rod is said to haue deuoured the roddes of the coniurers,

yet was it turned from a rodde to a serpent. Exod. 7.
                  Thirdly, a thing is called not onely as it is, but as it seemeth outwardly to be: so the Angell which the woman sawe at the sepulchre, is called a yong man. Marke 16. And in all these three respectes, the Sacrament is called bread, when it is not naturall bread. For it is a kind of foode, it was bread, and seemeth to be breade. But I will prooue, that in none of these respectes, it is called bread, but because it is naturall bread in deede, without conuersion of the substance.
                  First, whatsoeuer is saide in Saint Iohn. Cap 6. is not particular to the Sacrament: for bread is there taken figuratiuely for spirituall foode, which wee haue without the Sacrament.
                  Secondly, when S. Paul calleth the Sacrament bread, after consecration, there is no reason why the name of bread should not be taken for materiall bread, changed in vse, not in substance as the name of breade taken before consecration 1. Cor. 11. and where the Apostle saith the breade which wee breake, he sheweth plainlie, that he speaketh of material breade, for the bodie of Christe, nor spiritual foode, nor general foode are not broken. Secondly, in the conuersion of Aarons rodde, there was a sensible change, there is none such in the Sacrament. Thirdly, as the Angel had some appearance of a man in externall shape of bodie, so he had other manifest tokens in him that declared him to be an Angell, and no man: but the Sacramentall bread hath in it all tokens of material bread, and no sensible token of the bodie of Christ, therefore the comparison is nothing like. The water turned into wine, was iudged by the taste to be wine &amp; not water. There can be no such iudgement in the Sacramentall bread: for as materiall bread it tasteth, and partaketh all accidents: yea, it nourisheth, and corrupteth, which neither bare accidents, nor ye bodie of Christ doeth or can doe.
                  The authorities that Sander citeth, to proue, that the Sacramentall bread, is called the bodie and flesh of Christ, do not denie that it is material bread: yea, many

of the old writers, expressely affirme, that it is so. Yet let vs consider his authorities. Ignatius, Ep. 2. ad Rom. saith. Panem Dei volo, quod est caro Christi: I desire the bread of God, quod, which thing is the flesh of Christ. Verily, Ignatius saith no more here, then Zwinglius saide, which was no friend to transubstantiation. Secondly, Iustinus saith, Hic cibus, &amp;c. this meate is called with vs the Eucharist, or thanksgiuing: &amp; after he saith: We take not these things as common bread &amp; drink, but wee haue learned that the meate which is consecrated by the words of praier, taken of him, to be the flesh &amp; bloud of Christ. He that denieth the Sacrament to be cōmon bread, doth not denie it to be naturall bread. And Iustinus interlaceth that which Sander omitteth, 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . That meat, of which our bloud &amp; flesh, by transmutation are nourished, we haue learned to be the flesh &amp; bloud of yt Iesus, that was incarnate. That which nourisheth our flesh &amp; bloud, is material bread, although it be not cō
                     mon bread. Thirdly, Hilarie saith: Nos verè &amp;c. we truly take the word flesh, in our Lordes meate. The same Hilarie saith afterward: verè sub mysterio, truely, vnder 2 mysterie, we receiue the flesh of his bodie. Fourthly, Cyprian, lib. 2. Ep. 3. saith, Christ offered bread &amp; wine, that is to say, his owne bodie &amp; bloud. Here Sander cutteth off ye beginning of Cyprians words, which manifestly proue material bread &amp; wine: Obtulit hoc idem quod Melchizedech obtulerat, id est, panem &amp; vinu, suum scilicet corpus &amp; sanguinē: He offered the selfe same thing that Melchizedek had offered, that is to say, bread &amp; wine, namely his bodie &amp; bloud. Speake Sander, &amp; tel vs, was it not material bread &amp; wine which Melchizedek brought forth? the selfsame thing, saith Cyprian, offered Christ, which yet was his bodie &amp; bloud, after a certeine maner. After what maner you may learne,   In these wordes, you haue not onely the spirituall manner, after which the breade and wine are called his body and bloud, but also the same breade and wine, to be made of cornes &amp; grapes, which I trow cā be none other but material bread and wine. Fifthly, Irenaeus saith it is not now common bread, but the Eucharisty. lib. 4. C. 34. The same Irenaeus in the same place saith: that Eucharistia ex duabus rebus constant, terrena &amp; coelesti, the Sacrament consisteth of two things, an earthly thing, and an heauenly. Likewise he saith, yt of the bread &amp; wine, being made the Eucharisty, auge
                           •
                        ur &amp; consistit carnis nostrae substantia, the substāce of our flesh is increased and consisteth. lib. 5. that is not of accidents, nor of the reall body of Christ. Sixtly, Ambrose de Sacr. lib. 5. calleth our daiely bread, supersubstantiall breade, and yet I weene, it be still naturall food of the body. But he saith more. Non iste panis est qui vadit in corpus: sed illa panis vitae aeternae qui animae nostrae substantiam fulcit: It is not the bread which goeth into the body, but that bread of euer lasting life, which holdeth vp the substance of our soule. I like this saying of Ambrose, or whosoeuer writ that booke, very well. The Sacrament is not that bread which goeth into the body, ergo the Sacrament is not the naturall body of Christ, which the Papistes affirme to be a kind of bread, that goeth into ye body. Seuenthly, Gregory of Nyssa saieth, in vita Mosis, panis est, &amp;c. It is bread prouided for vs, without seede, without plowing, without any other worke of man. But he saith immediatly before, that it is receiued with a pure and cleane mind, and is an heauenly meate, therefore a spirituall food, spiritually to be receiued, and not bodily Eightly, S. Augustine Tra. 26. in Io

                         he called bread flesh? In deed the spirituall manner of nourishing, is not possible to be vnderstood of the flesh, but ye fleshly transubstantiation may be vnderstood of euery fleshly man. Ninethly, Isychius in Leuit. li. 6. C. 22. nameth the bread which S. Paule saith, is eaten vnworthily, nutritorem substantiae nostrae intelligibilis, the nourisher of

our spirituall substance. He meaneth, if it bee worthily receiued, otherwise it is damnation to him that eateth vnworthily. Lastly, Sedulius in Op. Pasc. saieth of the bread which Christ gaue to Iudas. Panem cui tradidit ipse, Qui panis tradendus erat. To whome he himselfe gaue bread, which bread was to be betrayed. A great miracle, if a Poet speake specially. But nowe directy against transubstantiation, speake many doctors. Origen saith in Mat. Cap. 15. The sanctified meat, by that which it hath materiall, goeth into the belly, and is cast foorth into the draught. Likewise, the matter of the bread profiteth not, &amp;c. Theodoret Di

                  Gelasius, a bishop of Rome, cont. Eutich. writeth of the bread and wine in the Sacrament: Et tamen esse non definit substantia &amp; natura panis &amp; vini. The substance and nature of the bread and wine ceasseth not to remaine.
                  These sayings with diuerse other, are direct against transubstantiation, and therefore lewdly doth Sander abuse the readers with a number of places of the old writers, to proue it, of which, not one of them hath a reasonable colour, when it is examined.
               
               
                  CAP. XII.
                  
                     The presence of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christin his last supper, is Sander. proued by the conference of holy scriptures taken out of the old testament.
                  
                  In deede of scriptures he bringeth ether vaine allegories Fulke. &amp; fantastical figures of his own brain, or els shamefully racketh ye sentences of the old testament, to make them prophecies of transubstantiation, which were not once spoken of the Sacrament. And first he slandereth S. Paul to haue said, yt to the Iewes al things chanced in figures, where he saith of such things, as came to passe in the wildernes: all these things happened to them, as figures or examples, &amp; are written for our instruction.

And although Saint Paul had so saide, as hee reporteth, yet it followeth not, that he may drawe their figures whither he will. He beginneth with the figure of Abel, whom he maketh the first shepeheard, Priest, Martyr, and perpetuall Virgine, in all which he would haue him to be a figure of Christ. Although that hee was the first shepeheard, it is not like, for it is not to bee thought that Adam altogether neglected the feeding of Cattell, before Abel tooke it in hand: no more then it is like, that he occupied no tillage, before Cainefell vnto it. But that he calleth Abel the first Prieste, it is vtterly false. For Adam was the first Prieste, and receaued or God the lawe of sacrificing, which hee taught vnto his sonnes: except Sander thinke, that Adam liued so many yeares, without exercise of religion, vntill Abel and Caine were made Priestes. For Caine is named to haue offered sacrifice as soone as Abel. Whereby it is probable, that neither of them both, was Priest, but Adam the heade of the familie, to whom they brought their seuerall oblations, vnto that place, which was called the presence of the Lorde, from whence Caine was bannished after his murther committed. Concerning Abels virginitie, I will not contend, although if I should followe the Iewish traditions, as Sander doth in his allegoricall comparison in diuerse pointes, I must say, he was a married man, hauing to wife his sister Delbora. But to the comparison Sander saith, that Abell first offered himselfe vnder the shape of other things, and after went forth to be offered in his owne person, being traiterously slaine. This is nothing else, but a drousie dreame of Sanders sleep
                        •
                     e heade. The sacrifice of Abel was a figure of the sacrifice of Christes death, and not of his last supper. Neither did he offer himselfe, vnder the shape of his satte lambes, but he offered his lambes in signe, that God by the mediation of Christs death, should accept him. Neither did Abel go forth of purpose to be offered in his own person, when he was murthered, as Christe did, neither was the death of Abel a sacrifice, whose bloud cried vengeance, whereas the bloud of Christs sacrifice

crieth mercie Heb. 11. Wherefore this is nothing else but a grosse abusing of the Scriptures, to faigne such foolish figures which haue no grounde in the worde of God, but are such as euerie one will inuent out of his own imagination. Euen as yt iest of Sander, yt Caine did beare a figure of the English communion, in which nothing but a few bsse fruits of the earth are offered: when much rather, I might say, that Cain did beare a figure of ye murdering church of Rome, which hath slain so many Abels, because her sacrifice of ye fruits of ye erth, is no better accepted. But what should I trifle after so vaine a ma ner? The second figure is of Melchizedek, which in deed seemed plausible to many of the old fathers. Against all which, I oppose the credit of the Apostle to ye Hebrewes, who omitting nothing that in Melchizedeks priesthood might be referred to Christ, maketh no mention of the sacrifice of bread and wine, which Melchizedek brought forth of princely liberalitie, &amp; not of priestly dutie. And yet it is a vaine thing for the Papists to brag of Melchizedeks bread &amp; wine, when they in their sacrifice wil acknowledg to remain, neither bread nor wine. But of al yt euer I heard, it is a most impudent comparison, yt Sander maketh of Melchizedek consecrating Abrahā by blessing of him, yt was really present, as it were in his hāds: And Christ consecrating his owne bodie &amp; bloud present in his hands at ye time of his blessing &amp; consecrating, and tanteth the Sacramentaries for acknowledging the one &amp; denying the other. Although he speake contrary to poperie, which teacheth the presence to be after consecration, and not at the time of consecrating. But what bridle may hold in the shameles furie of Sander?
                  The third figure is of the paschall lambe, which was a figure of Christs death, and so applied by S. Iohn in that saying, you shal not break a bone of him. Ioan. 19. &amp; S. Paul. 1. Cor. 5. &amp; not a figure of the supper, from which as it differeth in signe, so it is all one in the thing signified. The fourth is the prophesie and figure of Manna, which as the Apostle teacheth 1. Cor. 10 was the same spirituall meate, that we eate, &amp; not a figure thereof, but a sacrament

of our spirituall feeding by the flesh of Christ, like as the water of the rocke, which was Christ, was a Sacrament of our spiritual nourishment by the bloud of Christ. Wherefore the partes of this comparison, as they haue ben all answered before in the third book, so they are of no force to prooue ye real presence or transubstantiation, but the contrary, seing the differēce of these two Sacramentes, Manna and the Lordes bread, is only in the signes, &amp; nothing at all in the vertue of the things signified, according to S. Aug. rule. The fist figure is of the bloud of the old Testament, wherunto ye bloud of Christ shedde on the crosse doth answere, as the Apostle manifestly teacheth Heb. 9. therefore these wordes of the supper: This is the bloud of the new Testament, of necessity must be figuratiue, euen as these which are of the same sense: This cuppe is ye new Testament in my bloud. For we may not so farre aduance the Sacrament, that we abase the death of Christ, which is the only Sacrifice for our sinnes. The sixt is the prophecy and figure of Iob, which is a manifest peruerting of the scripture, from the true meaning: for either Iob complaineth of the cruelty of his seruantes, that would euen eate his flesh in his aduersity; and speaketh not of the loue that his seruantes had to be ioyned vnto his flesh, as ye context of that place Iob. 31. doth euidently shew; or els he sheweth the complaint of his seruantes, that were so occupied in hospitality, that they had no leasure to eate their meat, and therefore desired to eate the meare that was prouided for the stranger. Or if with Chrysost. we should vnderstand their desire to be of eating of Iobs flesh, yet it perreineth not to transubstantiation, seing we may eate the flesh of Christ without eating of the Sacrament. The seuenth conference is of prophecies taken out of Dauid and Salomon, whereas neither of both speaketh of the Sacrament, Dauid saith, Psa. 22. Thou hast prepared a table in my sight▪ against them who afflict me. By which wordes, he sheweth how bountifully God had bestowed his benif
                        •••
                      vpon him, both in this life; and also with assurance of the 
                        〈◊〉
                      to come, without any special regard vnto the supper of Christ, or any Sacrament yt was of the same signification

vnto him. The saying of Salomon, Pro. 9. I haue an swered in the beginning of this work, where it was placed by Sander. The 8. conference, is another Prophecie of Dauid, where he saith, all that be fat vpon earth, haue eaten &amp; adored. Sander saith, they haue adored yt which they do eat, but Dauid saith not so, Ps. 21. but that they shal worship God ye author of their food, as it followeth immediatly: They shall all fall down &amp;c. And whereas Sander quoteth Aug. in Ps. 98. to iustifie the adoratiō of the blessed Sacrament of ye altar, the footstoole, wherin the fulnes of ye godhead corporally dwelleth: you shall vnderstād yt Augustine vtterly denieth the Lords supper to be yt bodie yt was crucified, but a Sacrament, which being spiritually vnderstood, shall quicken vs. The last conference is of many prophecies &amp; figures, ioyned together, as he saith, for breuities sake. The first is of Noe being naked, after he was drunk, &amp; laughed to scorne of his sonne. So saith Sander was Christ after he had drunke his owne bloud in his supper, which he planted for him selfe in ye virgins wombe, hanged, naked, &amp; laughed to scorne, not only of the Iewes, but also of the Sacramentaries, for so grosse a deede, yt he drank his owne bloud, vnder ye form of wine. What shal I say to this monstrous blasphemie, wherein he compareth yt filthie drunkennes, &amp; shameles nakednes of Noe, to the holy mysterie and passion of Christ? After this he ioyneth ye cakes, that Abraham set before ye Angels, as figures of yt mystical cake which was to come in Christs supper: but whereof then were ye butter, milk, &amp; calues flesh, figures? O madnesse more then folly: for now wheresoeuer bread, corn, wine, vines, fruits of ye earth were named, all were figures of the sacrament, wherin yet he saith, is neither bread nor wine nor substance of any earthly fruit. Isaac blessed Iacob wc corne &amp; wine, saying to Esau, what cā I do more to thee
                        •
                      Iacob prophecied of the fat bread of Aser, yt should giue deinties to ye faithful kings of yt church. God promiseth as ye highest reward, for keping of his cōmandement, to blesse the loaues of his people, &amp; to giue abundance of bread &amp; wine. If it be lawfull for Sander on this sort to play wt the holy scriptures, he may proue what he list.

And more probably might we proue ye substāce of bread &amp; wine to remaine in ye Sacramēt, of which the scripture speaketh so often wt so great cōmendation, if we should reason after his maner. As for the meat of ye sacrifice, the she we bread, ye priests Ioaues: they were in deede figures ofye spiritual feeding, yt both they &amp; we had &amp; haue of y• flesh of Christ. But the curse of Elies house, that his posterity should come &amp; beg a morsel of bread, at the successors of Sadoc, it is a grosse prophanatiō of Gods word to apply it to a submission of the Priests of the Church, to obteine the Sacrament. And the dissembling of Dauid, before Achis, which came of infidelity, is blasphemous to apply to our Sauiour Christe, and especially with such termes, as Sander vseth, At his last supper he driuel
                           •
                        d like a child, to their seeming, that be wise in the world. he changed his countenance, and caried himselfe after a sort, in his owne handes, when holding and giuing to be eaten, that whith seemed bread, he doubted not to say, this is my body, &amp;c. For Christ carying him selfe after a sort in his owne handes, Augustine is cited in Ps. 33. who being deluded with that fond translation, &amp;ferebatur in manibus suis, (which is neither according to ye Hebrue text 1. Sam. 21. which saith, he plaied the mad man in their handes, nor according to the vulgar Latine, which saith, &amp; collabebatur inter manus eorum, he fell downe among their handes) troubleth himself to find how Dauid as a figure of Christ, should be caried in his owne handes, and at length concludeth that Christ, ipse se portabat quodammodo he caried himselfe after a certeine manner, when he said, This is my body. The meaning of Augustine is, when he caried the Sacrament of his body. To this Sander ioyneth, the ioy that Dauid had by the fruit of corne and wine Ps. 4. where contrariwise, he preferreth ye light of Gods countenance before all temporall benefites: but it is ynough for Sander, that he nameth corne and wine. Likewise the bread that strengtheneth, and the wine that comforteth the hart of ye spiritual man, Ps. 103. the meat that God giueth to them that feare him: these (if wee beleeue Sander) were prophecies of the Sacrament, in which is neither bread nor wine. But of all other, mee

thinke Sander should haue held his peace, of the Goodly chalice that maketh Christians drunke, Ps. 22. seing he wil not suffer Christiās, so much as to quench their thirst of that chalice, much lesse to be made drunk with it. Peraduenture it is, because the Papistes will keepe true Christians sober, that they will not suffer them to drinke of that goodly chalice that maketh men drunk. O shameles hypocrites! My soule yrketh to rehearse these grosse mockeries of Gods worde. Elias is fedde from the ayer with breade and flesh, and walketh 40. dayes in the inwarde 3. Reg. 17. 3. Reg. 19. strength of a peece of bread. Yet in the first there was bread and flesh, which would make well for the Lutherans; in ye other, there was bread and water, which would serue the turne of the Aquarians, if these places were figures of the Sacrament. The wheaten corne Es. 62. which Hieronyme interpreteth to be the corne of the Church, shall no more be giuen to her enimies, &amp; that vine wherin she hath labored, shall no more be drunke of strange children, the corne of the elect and the wine that ingendreth virgins, as the vulgar text translateth, Zachary Cap. 9. If they perteine to the Sacrament, doe rather fight against transubstantiation then for it. As for the bread in Ieremie 11. wherein the wodde is fastened, is a palpable error of ye translator, as I haue shewed before. The cleane Sacrifice of Malachie is to be offered of euery one of the faithfull, and therefore is not the Popish Sacrifice of the Masse. The bread of Angels was Manna, Psa. 77. which spiritually was ye body of Christ, as ye Sacramental bread is to vs. Last of all Salomon saith and repeteth often: No other thing to be good vnder the sunne, besides eating &amp; drinking with gladnes and mirth, where vnto Sander addeth, that ye best thing vnder the sunne, may be eaten and drunken, which Salomon neither said nor meant, but yt amongst the troubles and vanities of the world, nothing was better for a man, then quietly to enioy those things, which God giueth, and to lead his life peaceably &amp; iustly. Eccle. 3. v. 12. Finally where Sander concludeth, that the custom of ye scripture, in commending so much bread and wine, sheweth yt the body &amp; bloud of Christ should

be giuen vnder their forms: I say it may more probably be gathered to shew, yt bread &amp; wine are appointed to be the seals of our spiritual feeding, wt the body &amp; bloud of Christ. For it is a strange maner of cōmending, to praise the substance for ye only bare shewes &amp; accidents therof. Although the scripture in most of these places cited, intendeth in deede, neither the one conclusiō, nor ye other▪

                      out of question, rehearsing the wordes of Christ perteining to ye cup, saith: This cup is the newe Testament in my bloud: Hoc facite, doe this thing as often as ye shall drink, for the remembrance of me. And telling vs what they should do, he addeth a reason of yt saying: For as often as ye eat this bread, &amp; drink this cup, you shewe the Lords death vntil he come. Behold, what it is to do this thing in remembrance of him. In eating &amp; drinking of this bread &amp; cup, to preach the Lords death. Sander will reply, that This is general to all the Church: but Christ saying Hoc facite, speaketh onely to his Apostles and in them to all priestes. I aunswere, Christ speaketh to his whole Church, neither can it be proued, that the apos
                        •
                     l
                        •
                     s only were present. And yet it followeth not, that euery priuate man hath authoritie to minister the communion, seeing God hath chosen special persons, for the administration

of all publike actions in his Church.
                  As for the saying of Dauid, memoriam fecit, &amp;c. He hath made a remembrance, is to no purpose, for although he spake of the sacrament as he doth not, yet there is great difference betweene making the bodie of Christ, and making a remembrance of his meruailous workes. But Sander will faine the consent of the old fathers, to proue that Christes bodie is made. I will not denie, but the fathers sometime vse so to speake, when they vnderstande the sacrament, signe and figure of Christs bodie, and not as Sander doth his reall bodie to be made of breade: yet none of them expoundeth hoc facite, to be of a making, as well as of a doing. First hee alleageth the Liturgies of Iames, Clemens, Basil and Chrysostome, although none of them is his, whose name it beareth, yet are they of some antiquitie, and what say they? Fo
                        •
                     sooth there is a prayer in them, that God would send his holy spirite vpon them, and the holy giftes, which may sanctifie and make this bread the bodie of Christ. Heere breade is made the bodie of Christ. Very good, but by whom? by ye priest, or by ye holy ghost? If by the holy ghost, then it is not by vertue of these words, Hoc facite, which were not spokē to the holy ghost but to men. I omit, that this prayer in the old Liturgies, is vsed after ye words of consecration rehearsed, by which is giuen vs to vnderstand, that the bread is made the bodie of Christ, by the holy ghost in the faithfull, that receiue the bread, and not as it lyeth on the table. The like prayer he citeth, out of Cyrillus of Ierusalem: That the holy ghost woulde make the breade the bodie of Christ, and the wine the bloud of Christ, in Cate. myst. 5. But this is merueilous, that Sander saith: hee is desired so to doe, of the priest: who were not otherwise able to make so great a mysterie, if Christ had not commaunded him to make this thing: But I replie, if Christ had commaunded the priest to make his bodie, what neede he desire another to make it? And in that ye holy ghost must make it, it is certaine that Christ commaunded not the priest to make it. Out of Dionysius the counterfeit Areopagite, hee vrgeth the wordes 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      to

signifie a making or working of holie thinges, which may well stande with making and working of the sacrament, although there bee no making of Christes hodie commaunded. To lustinus we answered before in the 
                        〈◊〉
                      circumstance. But Irenaeus hath these wordes. Quando mixtus calix &amp;c. when the Chalice mixed with water, and the breade being broken, taketh the worde of God, then the Eu
                           •
                        harist of the bodie and bloude of Christ is made. It is made, saieth Sander, Yea verily, but it is one thing to say, ye Sacrament of Christes bodie and bloude is made, another thing to say his naturall bodie is made. But what is the Eucharist with you Papistes? the verie bodie and bloude of Christ. Then the sense of Irenaeus wordes must be thi
                        •
                     : the verie bodie and bloude of Christ, of the verie body and bloud of Christ is made: which were more then ridiculous.
                  Tertullian against Marcion saith, lib. 4. Acceptum panem &amp;c. The breade which he had taken and distributed to his disciples, hee made it his owne bodie. Loe saith Sander, he made the breade his bodie. Yea sir, but within six wordes following, he sheweth howe breade was called his bodie: namely, because it was a figure of his bodie. Ambrose de iis qui mysteriis init, saith Cap. 9. Sacramentum &amp;c. This sacrament which thou receiuest, is made by the worde of Christ. And hoc, quod conficimus, corpus ex virgine est. This thing which we make, is the bodie taken of the virgine. But let Ambrose expounde himselfe in the words following, soone after,

He himselfe calleth it his bloude, before consecratino it is called another thing, after consecration it is called bloude. Likewise when Hierom in Ep. ad Hel. saith that Priestes doe make the bodie of Christ with their holy mouth, hee meaneth the sacrament of his bodie, as he saith immediately after,

                  Out of Chrysostome are cited diuerse places, al which are rather against Sanders making, then for it, as these: The priestes make the oblation, which Christ gaue to his disciples. in 2. Tim. 2. He meaneth the sacrament vnproperly called of the old writers, an oblation, or sacrifice. Againe: The sacraments are begun and made perfect by the priest, de sacer. lib. 3. Againe, Non homo est qui corpus, &amp;c. It is not a man which maketh the bodie and bloude of Christ, but the same Christ, which was crucified for vs &amp;c. Yet Sander saith, Christ saying. Hoc facite, commaunded men to make his bodie. Aug. Cont. Faust, Manich. lib. 20. cap. 3. saith that our breade &amp; chalice is made mysticall vnto vs, not borne, made I say: Therefore hoc facite signifieth make this thing. I deny the argument, especially vnderstanding this thing for the naturall bodie of Christ. The same Augustine contra Adimantum saith: Our Lorde doubted not to say, This is my bodie, when hee gaue a signe of his bodie. Wherefore if hoc facite be, make that thing, which Christ gaue, it is make a signe of his bodie. The rest of the authorities of Theophilact, Damascene, Euthymius, Anselmus &amp;c. I will not stande to rehearse, because they being late writers, speake often more neere vnto the Popish heresies: And some of them were ranke papists: yet in this matter, for the signification of hoc facite, make this thing, not one of them speaketh directly, as Sander defendeth. But that the olde writers vse often the worde of making the bodie of Christ, &amp; the sacrament &amp;c. It proueth not that they vnderstoode facere in Christs wordes to make one substance of another, although by doing as Christ commaunded, such a bodie as he spake of, and such a sacrament was made.

                     What these wordes doe signifie, For the remembrance of me: and that they much helpe, to prooue Christes reall presence, Sander. vnder the formes of breade and wine.
                  
                  To the obiection that the remembrance of a man, differeth Fulke. from the man himself: Sander answereth, yt Christ said not onely, do this, but also, make this thing, because facere signifieth both to doe and to make: and the remē
                     brance of Christ is the shewing of his death, as S. Paul teacheth by facte and by making Christs bodie vnder diuerse kinds, to shew ye separation of the bodie from the soule, the breaking and eating of it in signe, sheweth the breaking of it on ye crosse &amp;c. To this I reply, that facere can haue but one signification at one time, and seeing facere in commemorationem is expounded by S. Paul (as Sand, also confesseth) to shew the Lords death, which is by doing &amp; not by making, except you meane, the making of ye sacrament, hoc facite is still do this thing. In deede, ye verie ministratiō of the sacrament according to Christs in stitutiō is a preaching of the Lords death: but it followeth not therof, that the Lord is present, whom ye Apostle, by implication saith to be absent: for he addeth, vntill he come, which were not properly saide, if in person he were present, but rather vntill he be seene, which is there present inuisible. To come, is to remoue, from one place to another place, where ye remouer was not before he came. But Sander saith, the presence of the benefactor, is the best meane to make his good deede remembred, as the scarre in a mans face being seene, is the best remembrāce of his fighting for his friends defence. I haue often shewed the vanitie of this kinde of reasoning, by which it shoulde followe that Christ left vs not the best token of remembrance of his death, because he is not seene, with the print of his wounds. But we must esteeme, the best remembrance, according to his wisedome, that hath

ordained it, who in all respects no doubt, hath appoin
                     
                        •
                     ed the best that might be for confirmation of our saith. Yet in Sanders example, or any that hee can deuise, a remembrance will alwayes differ from the thing remē
                     bred, as the scarie and the fighting, are not all one: so the remembrance of Christ crucified, and Christ crucified himselfe, are not all one. Neither must Sander baffu
                        •
                      vs, with the remembrance of an action onely, for wee are to remember the person with his benifites, in or for the remembrance of me, saith Christ, vntill he come, saith Paul. That a thing may be present, which is not seene, as to a blinde man, Sander needed not to proue, but that a thing may be both absent, and present, in the same substance, visibly or inuisibly, that is the matter, which would require Sander to shewe his witte, in giuing vs either a reason or an experience. But the reall presence of Christ, saith he, causeth the people to come with due preparation and mortification, which as Basil affirmeth, is a peece of the remembrance, whereas in eating and drinking breade and wine, Christe is so remembred, that sinnes be neither confessed, nor amendement minded, nor faith exercised, nor charitie vsed, as nowe a daies in England it is handled, by meanes of the newe preachers. What fruitfull remembrance of Christes death, the popish doctrine doth worke, wee lament to see the remanents, yet in diuerse places, where the people are not taught, that spend their time as they were wont to doe in poperie, when they had receiued their maker, as they were taught to speake. Contrariwise, where true doctrine and good discipline haue preuailed, enuie her selfe may see examples sufficient, to confute the shamelesse slaunders of Sander. As for the glorious monument of the Masse, which Sander describeth to shewe what remembrance of Christ is made therein: he doeth well to compare it to a sepulchre, which hath outwardly goodly painting &amp; carning, but inwardly is ful of rotten bones &amp; corruptiō. As good a shewing as yt and better too, may be made vpon a stage

with puppets. For what doctrine is there in the masse for the comfort of an afflicted conscience, but dumbe shewes and idle ceremonies▪ in exposition whereof the popish doctors themselues cannot agree, in which if there were any profitable doctrine, it were hidde from the people, as it were with the grauestone of an vnknowen tongue. But that which of all other is worst, what remembrance of Christes death and sacrifice call you that, which sacrilegiously challengeth vnto it selfe that which is singular and proper to the death of Christ? But Sander hauing once entred into the allegorie of a sepulchre, cannot so lightlie leaue it, but teacheth, that Christ hauing ordained the sacrament for a sepulchre, woulde not make it an hearse or sepulchre without his bodie lying therein. To this I answere, that sepulchres are to laye in deade carcases, but Christ is risen from death, and ascended into heauen, hauing left his sacraments as monuments of him that was deade, but nowe liueth eternally, not as graues wherein his deade bodie still shoulde remaine. But Chrysostome is charged to call Christes bodie 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      a carcase, because it is present, after the same rate, as it was deade in the sepulchre, not without life, but without sensible mouing as Epiphanius hath noted.
                  I answere, hee doth impudently charge Chrysostome to render that reason, why hee calleth Christes bodie a carcase, in 1. Corint. Homil. 24. because hee is present without sensible moouing. For there is no such thing in that homily, although there bee some excessiue and hyperbolicall speaches, as that Christ suffereth to bee broken in the Sacrament, which was not broken on the crosse. And euen as false it is that hee affirmeth of Epiphanius, for hee saith not that Christ is without sensible moouing. But speaking of the sacramentall bread Hoc

                     n the tombe of Saint Iohn, as the fable of Abdias sheweth: Therefore Christ woulde not bee inferiour to them, in leauing his bodie. But Christ himselfe telleth vs, that it is profitable for vs, that hee departe from the worlde in his humanitie, to prepare vs a place in heauen, and to supplie his bodily presence, most comfortablie with the presence of his holy spirite. Ioan. 16. It is most comfortable therefore for vs, that Christ hath carried his bodie into heauen, and placed vs in heauen with him, Ephe. 2. sending vnto vs his holy spirite, with all profitable graces from heauen.

If thou looke to that remembrance whereof, our Lorde saide, Doe this in the remembrance of mee, thou shalt finde, that this is the onely remembrance which may make GOD mercifull to men. Marke (saith Sander) this propitiatorie kinde of remembrance. Naye, marke the treacherie of Sander, that cutting off a sentence by the middle, applyeth the conclusion to the latter parte onely, which of the author is meant of the whole matter together. For Origen shewing the insufficiencie of the shewebreade, to make propitiation thus writeth.

And marke, whether ille and iste, That and this, can be referred to one and the same commemoration.

Most stedfastly beleeue thou, and nothing doubt, that the onely begotten sonne, God the worde, being made fleshe, hath offred himselfe for vs, to bee a sacrifice and oblation of sweete sauour vnto GOD: to whome with the father and the holy ghost, by the Patriarches, Prophetes, &amp; priests in time of the old testament, beasts were sacrificed: and to whom now that is in time of the new testament, with the father and the holy Ghost, with whom he hath one diuinitie, the holy Catholike Church thoroughout the whole worlde, ceaseth not to offer the sacrifice of breade and wine, in faith and charitie.

                     illing. In deede it is good to marke the writers wordes. Shall we then skippe ouer the authors wordes, which calleth this newe sacrifice, whereof he speaketh so much sacrificium panis &amp; vini, the sacrifice of breade and wine? Therefore when he saith, In this sacrifice: I aske, what sacrifice he telleth me, in the sacrifice of bread and wine, is euidently shewed, what is alreadie giuen vs? You see Fulgentius meaneth euident shewing, otherwise then Sander doth, which thinketh it cannot be by breade and wine. And as to Sanders reason, that flesh sheweth flesh, more euidently then breade: I answere that Fulgentius compareth not so much the euidence of the signes, as the difference of the times, which then was to come, nowe is past, concerning the passion of Christ. Although that which is shewed to be perfourmed already, is more euidentlie shewed, then that which is darkely promised to be perfourmed hereafter. And the doctrine of the Gospell in preaching Christes death, is a more cleere and euident demonstration of his benefites, then the doctrine of the sacrifices was.
                  
                     
But Sander compareth the flesh of the olde sacrifices, and the breade of the Lordes supper, as though it were none otherwise shewed to bee the remembrance of Christes death in the Church of Christ, then it is in their popish masse: whereas Fulgentius speaketh not of the bare ceremonie of the Sacrament, but of the Sacrament with the doctrine there vnto belonging, which is tence times a more euident shewing of Christes death then the olde sacrifices were. Otherwise he might say, that circumcision was a more euident shewing of mortification, and regeneration, then baptisme, because that which was done in the member, naturally made for generation, did more euidently shewe those mysteries, then dipping or sprinkling of water. But as their ceremonies were more sensible demonstrations, so the doctrine of our sacraments, is wonderfully more cleere and euident.
                  Finally, seeing this writer, entendeth to teach Peter the Deacon most plainely: why doth he call the sacrame
                        ••
                      the sacrifice of breade and wine, if there be no breade and wine in that holy office or seruice? for so hee taketh the worde Sacrifice, and not properly, as his whole exposition doeth shewe. For if he had meant a popish reall presence, why doth hee not once name any thing sounding there to? if hee had meant a propitiatorie sacrifice, why doth he so manifestly distinguish it from the sacrifice of Christ, and place it onely in thankesgiuing and remembrance of Christ crucified? Verily this place, whether it was written by Augustine or Fulgentius, it is vtter enimie to transubstantiation, and the propitiatorie sacrifice of the popish masse. But what neede I bring the fathers, one by one, saith Sander, sith the whole seconde Councell of Nice, doubted not to say▪ A worshipfull Councell, of vnlearned Idolaters: And what say they? 
                        Nemo sanctorum &amp;c. None of the holy Apostles, which are the trumpet of the holy Ghost, either of our glorious fathers, hath said our vnbloudy sacrifice, which is made in the remembrance of Christ our Lord and God, his passion and of his whole

conuersation, to be an image of that bodie. If this Councell say true, that none of the Apostles haue so said, then Sander is condemned by this Councell, for falsifying the Scripture. Heb. 10. when vnder colour of the Apostles wordes, he affirmeth the sacrament not to be a shadowe of thinges to come, but to be the image of the thing it selfe. Lib. 3. Cap. 10. But that all these fathers do lie, when they say none of our fathers, haue said the sacrifice to be an image of his bodie, it might be proued by diuerse ancient witnesses: among which I will name Ambrose, Offici. lib. 1. ca. 1. who speaking of the sacrament, which he calleth the sacrifice, wherein Christ is offered, saieth, Hîc in imagine, ibi in veritate, heere in an image, there hee is offered in trueth, where as an aduocate hee maketh intercession with the father for vs. In this saying, what is the image, but the sacrament? and whereof is it an Image? of his bodie: where the image is also perfectly distinguished from the truth. Also Theodoret Dialog. calleth the sacrament an image, opor
                           •
                        es imaginis esse exemplar arche

                        ypum. The chiefe paterne must bee an example of the image, meaning by the paterne, Christ; by the image, the sacrament of his supper.
                  Finally to the authoritie of this seconde Nicen councell, I oppose the Ephesine Councell, which determined against images, and affirmed the Sacrament of the bodie and bloude of Christ to be the onely image of his passion, that is left for Christian men to imbrace.
                  The last Chapter of this booke, being entituled by name against that reuerende father Master Nowels challenge, is so plentifully, and substantially confuted by himselfe, against whom it was written, that I neede not once to meddle with it. Onely I note that Sander vrging Master Nowel to replie, promiseth a speedie reioynder, yet Master Nowels booke hauing beene so manie yeares abroade, Sanders reioynder is not yet come to light.

                  IN this fift Booke, he laboureth to peruert, what soeuer saint Paul hath written of the sacrament, to drawe it to his reall presence. And that he might be more bolde, without all shame to reiect the scripture, he would haue it to be considered, that Augustine affirmeth Sainct Paule to dispute (according to the apostolike manner) more plainelie, and rather to speake properly, then figuratiuely. In deede Augustine affirmeth (as Sander saieth) that the Apostle in these wordes, He that will not labour, let him not eate, speaketh rather properly, then figuratiuely: but that all his wordes of the sacrament, be proper and none figuratiue, he neither saide not thought. And yet he saith, that manie thinges, and almost al things in the Aposto like writings, are after that manner, de Oper. Monac. cap. 2. But Sander of meere fraude to deceiue the ignorant, left out those wordes, because he woulde haue men thinke, that Augustine speaketh either peculiarly of the sacrament, or generally of euerie worde that is in the Apostles writing. Wherefore although the Apostle vse more commonly to speake properly, then figuratiuely: yet it followeth not, that speaking of the sacrament, which is afigure in his owne nature, he shoulde not speake rather figuratiuely then properly: and yet God be thanked, he hath spoken so plainely, that all the transubstantiators in the world, shall not be able to cleere themselues from his authoritie.

                  The like figuratiue speaches are in the blessinges of Moses the man of God, Deut. Cap. 33.

Our Lorde Iesus himselfe crieth out, This is my body; before the blessing of the heauenly words it is called one kinde, after consecration, the body of Christ is signified. He himselfe calleth it his bloud, before consecration it is called another thing, after consecration it is called bloud.
                  
                  But now▪ concerning the worde of communicating, Sander saith that it sheweth both the effect wrought by blessing, which is the presence of the bloud of Christ, and the finall cause why it is made, verily to communicate vnto vs the merites of Christes death, where the said bloud was shedde for the remission of sinnes. If the chalis after blessing; had no bloud in it: how did it communicate to vs the bloud of Christ? This is Sanders deepe diuinity. As though the bloud of Christ, is not communicated to vs in baptisme, for the remission of sinnes, by the merites of Christes death, where yet the bloude of Christ is not really present. But seing the Apostle saith, that the cuppe of blessing which wee blesse, is the communicating of the bloud of Christ, it followeth that the wicked, which haue no fellowship with Christ, receiue nor the bloud of Christ in the cuppe, and consequently, that the bloud of Christ is not really present. Yet Chrysostome giuing the literall sense, (saith Sander) of those wordes, writeth thus, Eorum autem huiusmodi est sententia, quod est in calice, id est quod a latere fluxit, &amp; illius sumus par

                           •
                        . Of these wordes this is the meaning: The same which is in the chalice, is that which flowed from the side, and thereof we are partakers. I answere, Chrysostom doth so giue the literal sense, that he meaneth the bloud of Christ to be no otherwise then sacramentally in the chalice: for in the same Hom. 24. in 1. Cor. 10. he affirmeth, yt Christ suffereth himselfe to be broken in the Sacrament, which he suffered not on the crosse: That wee are the selfesame body, that we receiue. Finally, to shew where we are partakers of Christes body, he saieth that by this Sacrament, we are made eagles, and flye vp to heauen, or rather aboue heauen, for where the dead body is, thither will the eagles be gathered.

                  He brabbleth much, of breaking, forgetting that it is Fulke. bread which Saint Paul saith to be broken: but common bread (saith he) cannot haue such vertue, yt Christ might be knowne thereby, as he was of the two disciples, in the breaking of the bread which S. Augustine thinketh to be the communion. I answere, the Sacrament, although it be very bread, yet is it not common bread, but consecrated, to be a seale of our spirituall feeding by the body of Christ, and therefore as sufficient to testifie our communication with Christ, as water in baptisme, the cleansing of our soules with his bloud.
                  In handling the word of communicating, he bringeth in a distinction of 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , out of Chrysostom, which is vaine and to no purpose, seeing the Apostle vseth both the wordes for one. For when he had said, we are one bread, and one body, being many, he giueth a reason thereof: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : For we all are partakers of one bread. Now concerning the matter of communicating of Christ, Sander saith, it can not be by a bare signe and token. And wee say euen the same, but by a Sacrament, wherein Christes body and bloud is not really present, it may be. For els how are they that are baptised only, made members of Christ, and haue a true communicating of his body and bloud? yea, how had all the fathers before Christes incarnation, this communicating of Christes body and bloud? without which they were no members of Christ, the like I say of raysing of our bodies, not by a figure of Christes body, but by the vertue of his body it selfe, which vertue if it could not be communicated to our bodies, otherwise then by reall presence in the Sacrament, as Sander falsly dreameth, that Irenaeus shoulde meane, by what meanes should the resurrection of all them be wrought

which haue not receiued the Sacrament? O shameles, and yet most blockheaded kinde of reasoning! As for Irenaeus, hee prooueth the resurrection of our bodies against the heretiks, by that they are fed with the body &amp; bloud of Christ, in the Sacrament, by their owne confession. But he doth not hold it necessary, that who so euer i
                        •
                      partaker of the resurrection of the righteous, must receiue the Sacrament, or the naturall body of Christ, really present in the Sacrament. For we haue communication with God the father &amp; with Iesus Christ by faith, as S. Ioan teacheth, 1. Ioh. 1. in the Gospell preached and receiued. And whereas Sander saith, that S. Irenaeus neuer dreamed of bloud, that should be receiued from heauen: I demande what is the heauenly part of the Sacrament? When Irenaeus affirmeth that it consisteth of two thinges, an earthly thing, and an heauenly thing, lib. 4. Cap. 34. I suppose yt the heauenly thing, can be nothing but the body and bloud of Christ, which seing he affirmeth it to be a heauenly thing, verily it can not be conteined in an heauenly vessell, nor be receiued but from heauen.

For by the spirite of God, wee are as verily vnited vnto ye body of Christ in baptisme, as in the supper: therefore the reall presence is not necessary for this vniting. I passe ouer how ignorantly Sander abuseth ye example of fire conuerting all things into it selfe, to shewe how Christ which is a consuming fire, turneth vs into his body, whereas God in respect of his

Iustice, and not of his mercy, is in scripture called a consuming fire. Where he saith, the vnion can not be made by wheaten bread, I agree with him: but wheaten bread and the fruit of the vine, receiued according to Christes institution, may testifie that vnion vnto vs, as well as elementall water in baptisme, which is made by the spirit of God. So saith Cyprian, lib. 1. Ep. 6. ad Magnum: that Quā
                        do &amp;c. when Christ calleth bread which is made of many graines, his bodi, he signifieth our people which he bare, to be vnited vnto him; and when he calleth wine, which is pressed out of many grapes and bunches, and brought into one, his bloud, he signifieth likewise our flock, coupled togither by commixion of the multitude, that is ioyned in one. Cyprian saith, bread and wine made of graines and grapes, and not the forme of bread, which was made of graines, &amp; is now no bread, as (Sander saith) doth represent this vnion. Neither did any auncient writer say, or thinke, that by the accidentes and not by the substance of bread, and wine, our coniunction is represented.

                  Now must we haue a further tast of Sander his tedious Fulke. Sophistrie, in ioining the wordes together. The bread which we break, is the communicating of Christs bodie, because we being many, are one breade, and one bodie, for we all partake of the one breade. Here bread being thrise named (saith hee) is put to expresse one and the same mysterie. But that is false: for in the first and last place, breade is put for the earthly matter of the mysterie, or sacrament. Against this Sander replyeth, and saith: that if we once take the substance of common bread, to be the thing which is broken, neither is that substance the communicating of Christes bodie, nor wee are all one materiall breade.
                  
                     
I might likewise reason thus: if the bread that is broken, be the substance of the bodie of Christ, neither is 
                        〈◊〉
                      the communicating of the bodie of Christ, neither a

                     bstance. Wherefore, to auoide all cauilling: the bread which we breake, is the communicating of Christes to
                     
                        •
                     ie spiritually &amp; sacramentally: not really, corporally, &amp; substantially. Against this, Sand
                        •
                     r riseth vp and saith, that if to bee, is interpreted to signifie, then in the next verse, where it is saide, we that are manie, are one bread, and one bodie, we are said to be the figure of one bread, because it is one verbe and one nowne in both places. A simple cause, as though one verbe and one nowne in diuerse places may not be diuersly taken. And yet we can not be called one bread, but figuratiuely, that is like vnto one loafe of bread, made one of many graines, &amp; one bodie, that is like vnto one bodie, consisting of diuerse members spiritually vnited together. But Sander vrgeth vs further by the wordes of breaking and partaking: if the bread broken be materiall bread (saith he) wee partake of the materiall bread, and yet the bread whereof we partake, is by Saint Paul named one, for seeing it is broken, it is not still one. I answere: wee partake all of one materiall breade, which is either one in lumpe, or kinde, to signifie, that wee doe spiritually communicate with the onely bodie of Christ by faith. As for Sanders cauill, that the bread is not one still, seeing it is broken, is an impudent Sophisme. For neither can Christ at one time, and in one respect be called whole and broken. Do not they all eate of one sheepe, which eate of it after it is deuided in partes? The lawe commanded one sheep for euery houshold, which was the same Sacrament in spirituall signification and effect, that the one bread and cup is vnto vs. So we all eate of one material bread, and are spiritually made one mysticall bread and bodie, not so many a
                        •
                      eate the materiall bread, but so many as eate

it worthily by faith. Wherefore the vertue of coniunctio is not in that which is eaten with the mouth, as Sander would haue it seeme, but in the mightie working of the spirite of God, who not onely in this Sacrament, but in all Sacraments of all times, haue wrought the same spirituall vnion, in all the faithful of all ages, who al make one Church and one bodie, whereof Christ is the head, and euery one of the elect is a member.

                  Sander maketh two meanes of our coniunction in Fulke. this mysticall bodie, faith, and the Sacraments. but in verie deede, the spirite of God, is the only principal meane which worketh this incorporation in Gods elect, sometimes, not onely without the Sacraments, but also without actuall faith, as in infants which perteine to Gods election. Faith in men of yeres, is an assurance of this coniunction: The Sacramentes are a confirmation of faith. Wherefore the bread which we breake, is so a cō
                     municating of the mysticall bodie of Christ, as it is an vndoubted seale of our faith, by which we are assured of this communication, before wee come to the communion: and therefore no necessitie of the bodily presence, vnder the fourme of bread. For the bread that we breake is none otherwise the bodie of Christ, then wee are made one bodie, and one bread. But wee are made one bread and one bodie, spiritually and sacramentally: therefore the bread is the bodie of Christ spiritually &amp; sacramentally. Sander asketh, Howe could one bread and one bodie be put to signifie one thing, but that in deede bread and bodie are here in substance the selfe same thing? I answere, if bread and bodie be the selfe same thing, and the selfesame thing that the Sacrament is: then is not the Sacrament the naturall bodie of Christ, for wee are not made the naturall bodie of Christ, but his mysticall bodie, by

                     rall bodie of Christ, which I doe not deny, but I affirme that the naturall body of Christ is communicated vnto vs by spirituall and heauenly working of his spirite, and not by corporall mingling or ioyning of the same to our bodies: which also Augustine in serm. ad infantes a
                           ••
                        d Bedam, cited by Sander, doth plainly testifie. 
                        Nulli est allquatenus, &amp;c. No man ought by any meanes to doubt, but that he is then made partaker of the body and bloud of our Lorde: when he is made a member of Christ in baptisme, neither is he alienated from the company of yt bread and that cuppe, although before he eate ye bread &amp; drinke that cuppe (being placed in the vnity of Christes body) he depart out of this world. For he is not depriued of the partaking and benifite of that Sacrament: for so much as himselfe hath found that thing, which the Sacrament doth signifie, whereas Christ said, except ye eate my flesh and drinke my bloud, ye shall not haue life in you. Out of this place, although it be directly against transubstantiation, yet Sander is able to prooue it. If the body of Christ (saith he) were not really vnder the forme of bread, how could he that is baptised, be partaker of the benifit of this Sacramēt? was he made partaker of bread and wine? No forsooth, but he is made in baptisme partaker of the bodie and bloud of Christ, which is signified by that bread and cuppe. So saith Augustine, or who so euer was author of that sermon, and therefore the bodie of Christ is none otherwise present, in the supper then in baptisme.
                  But take away that bodie of Christ (saith Sander) from the forme of breade, and there is no signe of vnitie in Christ: for euery loafe betokeneth vnitie, but not in Christ. Againe, let the substance of breade remaine, and signifie the mysticall bodie of Christ, which is absent, the vnion of Christ and his members is signified to be as farre asunder, as heauen is distant from earth. I answere, this is poore Sophistry, yet much vsed by Sander, disioyning thinges yt ought to be ioyned togither: beside yt this wise reason would proue likewise,

that baptisme is no signe of perfect vnitie in Christ, because Christ is not really present with the forme of water, but the substance of water remaining on earth, and 
                        •
                     he bodie of Christ to whom wee are incorporate, is in heauen. Howe be it wee teach the presence of Christ in his mysteries, such presence I say, as is meete for his glorious maiestie, namely by his spirite, which ioyneth heauen and earth together, and maketh our vnitie to be perfect, although in nature and place wee bee neuer so farre distant. And such presence of Christ in his sacraments wee acknowledge, as may stande with the truth of his naturall bodie, which if hee haue not like vnto ours in all thinges, except sinne, and such infirmitie as our bodie is subiect vnto through sinne, in vaine, should wee looke for the redemption of our bodies by him, and the conformation of them vnto his glorious bodie.
                  The vnitie that saint Hilarie spake of, wee allowe. lib. 8. de Trinit. If Christ assumpted truely the flesh of our bodie, and wee take truelie vnder a mysterie, the flesh of his bodie, and by this wee shall bee one, because the father is in him, and hee in vs: howe is the vnitie of will affirmed, when the naturall propertie by the which Sacrament is a Sacrament of a perfect vnitie?
                  
                  In this saying, Hilarie reprooueth the Arrians, which affirmed that the vnitie of Christ with his father, was not an vnitie of nature and substance, but of will only. But seeing the vnitie that wee haue with Christ, which is prooued by his taking of our flesh truely, and by giuing his flesh truelie vnto vs vnder a mysterie in ye Sacrament, to bee an vnitie in substance, and not in will onely, it is absurd to say, that the vnity of Christ and his father should bee one lie in will. Now let vs see, what poyson the Spider sucketh out of this wholsome flower.
                  First he noteth, that we truely take the flesh of Christ: I graunt vnder a mysterie, as Hilarie saith, so many as receiue ye Sacramēt worthily, for els wicked men should be

vnited to Christ, as he is to his father. Secondly, the mysterie with Sander, must be the forme of bread, but that I denie, for the forme of bread is no secrete, but a visible and naturall thing. Wherefore, the mysterie vnder which, we truely take the flesh of Christ, must be that secrete and wonderfull manner, by which Christ doeth communicate his flesh vnto vs. Thirdly, he sayeth, that worde Proprietie, doeth signifie a person, because Augustine saith, Christ is a vine by similitude, non per proprie
                        
                           •
                        atem, not by propertie, where by propertie, Augustine meaneth properly, and not a person. Wherefore Hilarie meaneth, that the naturall propertie of incorporating yt meate that is eaten in the Sacrament, is a Sacramento
                        •
                      holy signe of a perfect vnitie, such as is made betweene the meate and the eater, and not such an agreement only, as is betweene friends, that are of one mind. Therefore Sander doeth openly and violently falsifie Hilarie, where he saith, the naturall proprietie of Christ by a Sacrament is a sacrament, interpreting property for person. After he hath thus abused Hilarie, he commeth to Augustine,  
                        
                           de ciuitate Dei, lib. 10. Cap. 5. This is the Sacrifice of the Christians, we being many, are one body in Christ: the which thing also the Church celebrateth in the Sacrament of yt altar, knowne to the faithfull: where it is shewed to her, that in that sacrifice, which he offereth, her self is offered.
                  
                  Here Sander maketh a foolish Dialogisme, betweene Christ and his father reprouing him, that he hath gotten such a goodly mysticall bodie, of the bakers making, &amp;c. But Augustine speaketh of an Eucharisticall sacrifice, offered in the celebration of the Lordes supper, by the Church, in which the Church her selfe is offered in a mysterie, or holy signe of our coniunction with Christ, which is celebrated in the Sacrament. And so doeth Augustine interpret hemselfe Cap. 5. Sacrificium ergo visibile inuisibilis sacrificij sacramentum, id est sacrum sigr

                        •
                     one of his bone, without that grosse and fantasticall presence in the Sacrament: and this communication is sealed vnto vs, as well by baptisme as by the supper. Sander citeth Irenaeus, Chrysostome, Cyrill and Theodoret, to prooue, that it is the naturall flesh and bones of Christ, whereunto we are ioyned: and further vrging the similitude of mariage, whereunto our spirituall coniunction is resembled, not more grossely then filthily, compareth our perfect vnitie with Christ, vnto the acte of generation in marriage, about which matter he spendeth two or three leaues. Whereunto I answere, shortly, that we do acknowledge, that we are truely vnited to the naturall bodie and bloud of Christ, which he tooke of our nature, by such meanes as is common to all the elect of God, which can be nothing else but his spirite, although ye same be assured vnto vs by faith, &amp; our faith therein effectually confirmed by all the Sacraments of God, and especially, by the supper of our Lorde, but not onely thereby.
                  As for the presence of the bodies to be ioyned, which Sander requireth, is no naturall presence in one proper

place, more of Christes bodie comming downe from heauen into euery one of our bodies, then of al our bodies comming from all partes of the world into one. But the bodie of Christ keeping his owne proper place

                     nd mysterie, that is by the visible sacrament, taught to bee truely, but yet after a spirituall manner, Likewise where Chrysostome saith in Ioan. 24. It is brought to passe by the meate which Christ hath giuen vs, that we may bee conuerted into that fleshe, not onely by loue but in deede. No Christian man can vnderstande this conuersion that is made in deede or in the thing it selfe, to bee carnall, but onely spirituall. For what madnesse were it to say, that wee are turned into the naturall fleshe of Christ, after a corporall manner? To conclude, Sander cannot prooue his fleshly presence, without manifest falsifying of Cyrillus both in words &amp; sense. For thus he citeth him in Ioan. lib. 10. cap. 15. iu deede it is cap. 13.

of the fleshe of Christ? It is therefore the vertue of the mysticall blessing, and not the reall presence of Christes bodie in the Sacrament, that maketh Christe

                  But it is a daintie matter, that Sander vppon the wordes of Saint Paul: ye cannot be partakers of the table of our Lorde, and of the table of Diuels; saith, Our

                     ewe brethren, granting the diuels a reall table, will

                     ot allowe anie such to Christ. What meaneth our olde enimie, thus to bable in his instrument and spokesman Nicholas Sander? Doe not wee allowe Christ a reall and visible table, wheron the visible sacrament is ministred? If he meane that Christ is really present, at his table, as the diuells are at their table, let him aduise himselfe, whether they that are partakers of ye diuels table, are incorporate to the diuell, by eating the diuell actually, into their bodies, or by communicating with his idolatrous ceremonies: if onely by the latter, what neede haue we of his often vrged reall presence to bee made partakers of the Lordes table, and to bee incorporated vnto him? When for a sacramental coniunction the ceremonie is sufficient, for a true incorporation the spirit of God onely bringeth it to passe, both with the sacramentes, and without them, in euery one of Gods electe which is a member of Christ.
               
               
                  CPAP. VI.
                  
                     The reall presence is prooued by the example which Saint Sander. Paul vseth concerning the Iewes and Gentiles.
                  
                  
                     
First, he would prooue, that the Christians haue a sacrifice, Fulke. because Saint Paul vseth the examples of the sacrifices of the Iewes and Gentiles: but he seeth not the analogie. S. Paul cōpareth not the sacrifice of the Christians with the sacrifice of the Iewes and Gentiles, but y• feast of the sacrifice of the Christians, with the feastes of the sacrifices of the Iewes &amp; Gentiles. Nowe the Lordes supper, is the feast of the onely sacrifice of Christ, once offered by him, which maketh vs to communicate with his sacrifice, if we receiue it worthily, as the feasts of the Iewish and idolatrous sacrifices, made the partakers cō
                     municate with their sacrifices, &amp; them to whom thei are offered. And whereas the Apostle saith, we haue an altar wherof they haue no power to eat, that serue in the tabernacle: he meaneth yt the ceremoniall Iewes, can haue no participation of the sacrifice of Christ, except they renounce their Iewish obseruations. Or if you wil vnderstand it of such sacrifices of praise, as the Apostle within fewe lines after speaketh; or of the Lords supper, which is a remembrance of Christs onely sacrifice, as some haue done, the cause of the real presence is neuer awhit holpen. Yes (saith Sander) This then being the meat of our altar, it followeth, that this meat is no lesse present vpon his holy table: then that which the Iewes or Idolaters did eate, was present a
                           •
                         their sacrifices: but that which they did partake, was really presēt, and receiued into their mouthes. Therfore, likewise Christes fleshe is really present, and receiued into our mouthes. I denie the minor or assumption of this syllogisme. For the diuels, wherof the Gentiles did partake, were not really present in the meate which they did eate, nor receiued into their mouthes. The like I say of the altar of the Iewes, wherof they were partakers which did eat of the sacrifice. Wherfore this argument may be rightly turned backe vppon Sanders neck. The diuels and the altar, whereof the Gentiles and Iewes were partakers, were not really present in the meate, nor receiued into their mouthes: therefore the flesh of Christ, whereof the Christrians are partakers, is not really present in the bread, nor receiued into their mouthes.

                     ent was eaten before he died, which that Theophylact might salue, he saith, that Christ sacrificed himself from 
                        •
                     hat time wherein he deliuered his bodie to his disciples: which is all one, as if he said, that Christ died more then once, directly contrary to the scripture. Heb. 9. But seeing in the determination of God, and in respect of the effect of his death, he was the lambe slaine from the beginning of the worlde, the institution of the Sacrament shewed his death before he died, as wel as after. But how the bloud of Christ was really separated from his body, before his passion, otherwise then in a Sacrament, or mysterie, let Sander tell, if he can. And where he saith, a figure eaten, can shewe but a figuratiue death past, it is vtterly false: for the figures of the lawe, shewed not a figuratiue, but a reall death to come. And doeth not baptisme, where is no reall presence, shewe the Lordes death, buriall, and resurrection truely past? But Sander will helpe the matter, by false pointing a place of Ambrose in 1. Cor. 11. Quia enim morte Domini liberati sumus: huius rei memores in edendo &amp; potando, carnem &amp; sanguinem quae pro nobis oblata sunt significamus: Because we are deliuered by the death of our Lorde, being mindfull of this thing in eating and drinking, wee signifie the fleshe and bloud which were offered for vs. Which Sander thus englisheth: Because we are made free, through the death of our Lorde being mindfull thereof, wee in eating &amp; drinking flesh and bloud, shewe the things that were offered to death for vs.
                  
                     
The example he bringeth out of Damascen, of them that defended the carying of dead mens bones, because they put them in remembrance of death, is friuolous, &amp; maketh nothing to the purpose: for I will demaunde of Sander that vrgeth so egerly the real presence for shewing of Christes death: is the bodie of Christ in the Sacrament dead or aliue? if it be aliue, as I am sure he wil say, what similitude hath it with ye dead bones, and howe doeth it shewe his death which is eaten aliue, except it be in the dead figures of bread and wine, which haue no life? If the death be represented only in outward shewes, seing the bodie that is receiued is aliue, what is become of Sanders diuinitie and Logike, yt the figures or shewes of a dead bodie cannot shewe but a figuratiue and imagined death. As for the argument, a consequentibus, holdeth aswell of the Sacrament, as of the matter therof, ye eate the Sacrament of Christ crucified, ergo Christ is crucified. But Sander would separate all doctrine from the Sacrament, and knowe howe we should shew him to haue died, by onely eating it. I aunswere, by onely eating of a liuing bodie, we could not knowe that he had died: therefore doctrine of necessitie must be ioyned with the outward action.
                  And further, where he would knowe, whether Christ did institute this Sacrament, to shewe his death past in deede, or past
                        〈…〉
                      a bare shadowe: I answere, he instituted it before his death, and therefore not so much to shewe the historie of his death to come or past, as to shewe the vertue of his death, by which his bodie was broken, and his bloud shed, that it might be meate and drinke vnto vs. And when the Apostle saith, wee shewe the Lordes death, he meaneth not onely the bare storie thereof, but the fruit and effect thereof: wherefore Sander playeth the foole egregiously, to bable so much of Christs death past in deede, or in shadowes to come: For the olde Sacraments, did not only prophecie of an action to bee done, but also did confirme the faith of the godly, in the fruits &amp; effects of the passiō of Christ. Finally, Chrysostome in 1. Cor. 24. speaketh figuratiuely, where he

saith, when thou feest this bodie set before thee, say with thy selfe: This bodie nailed and beaten, was not ouercome of death. This bodie, the sunne seeing crucified, turned away his beames, &amp;c. but he expoundeth himselfe sufficiently in the same Homily, where he saith, we must be Eagles, &amp; flie into heauen, where the bodie of Christ that died for vs, remaineth. In the same sense, that it is called the bodie of Christ, he applyeth to the Sacrament such things as were proper to the bodie of Christ. But as for transubstantiation, which the Papists woulde gather out of this place, in many places he sheweth, that he acknowledgeth not, and ad Caesarium monachum, he doth expressely denie it.
               
               
                  CAP. VIII.
                  
                     The reall presence is proued by the illation which S. Paul maketh Sander. concerning the vnworthie eating &amp; dr
                           〈…〉

Hee that dispitefully abuseth, or negligently cōtemneth ye princes seale offered vnto him, offendeth against the maiestie &amp; person of the prince, &amp; yet the maiestie and person of the prince, is not really present vnder the formes of parchement and waxe. But Sander saith, the vnworthie shewing of Christs death, is the vnworthie eating. Who will graunt him, that shewing of Christes death, is nothing but eating of the Sacrament? Neither doth S. Paul confesse (as Sander impudently affirmeth) that euil men may haue the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ in their mouthes. He saith: who so eateth this bread, &amp; drinketh this cup of the Lord vnworthily, (for so much as the same is honoured with the names of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, is guiltie of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, which he despiseth in these mysteries. But it is not bread &amp; wine whereof S. Paul speaketh, because he doeth name it, This bread (saith Sander) For seeing the Pronown This doth shewe a thing present to some sense or other. S. Paul being absent, could not shew
                           •
                         any thing by any corporall action: then it remaineth, that the thing whereunto (This) doeth point, is the bodie of Christ, whereof he spake before.
                     
This Grammaticall Logike, is meete for Papisticall diuinity. I thinke there was neuer man, that set his penne to the paper, that wrot more impudently. What say you, Master doctor Sander? Doth the Pronowne This, alway shewe a thing present to some sense or other? To what sense is the body of Christ present, in that thing, whereof it is saide: This is my body? And doth the absence of Saint Paule hinder him to speake of breade in saying, This bread; and further him to speake of Christes naturall body, in saying, this is my body. This learning, Master Sander, passeth my vnderstanding. What saied I, this learning? I knowe not how to speake, seing the pronowne This, doth shew a thing present to some sense, or other, but the learning, shewed in this. Tush, I must say in such kind of reasoning, is an higher matter, then can be conceiued by any sense, witt, reason, or vnderstanding. Neither is his sharpnes lesse in answering obiections, then in making of argumentes. For if you obiect, that Christ meant the signe of his body: he answereth, that seing Saint Paule named no signe, as (This) can not point to that which was not named, so it must point onely to the thing named before, which was the body of Christ broken for vs, therefore this bread, meaneth that body of Christ and none other substance. I blame not Master Sander, if he will not haue. (This) to point to a signe, which was not named, seeing he will not haue it point to bread, which wt ye Pronown This, is named, but to the body of Christ, which in another sentence was named. So that by this bread, he doth not mean this bread, but that body. But seing he can allowe, but one substance present, and that body in the same truth is named, this bread: what reason is there, that the thing which the word of God calleth bread, and al reason and euery sense confirmeth to be bread, should not be naturall breade, but taken figuratiuely: and that which is by the word of God onely, called the body of Christ, all sense and reason reclaiming, that it should be his naturall body must neuerthelesse be his naturall body, and by no meanes must be thought to be taken figuratiuely?
               
               
                  
                  CAP. IX
                  
                     The reall presence is prooued, because vnworthy receiuers are Sander. guilty of Christes body and bloud.
                  
                  A man is guilty (saith Sander) either for doing an euill Fulke. deede, or leauing a good deede vndone: or doing a good deede after an euill manner, and after the last manner is he guilty, that receiueth vnworthily. I will not deale with his diuision, nor inquire whether euery one that receiueth vnworthily, doth a good deede after an euill manner. But to the purpose of the reall presence: his deede (saith Sander) is eating, which thing he so really doth, that S. Paule affirmeth him to eate and drinke damnation to him selfe. Why so, Sander? is that which he eateth and drinketh really damnation? if it be, then surely he eateth nor drinketh really the body and bloud of Christ, which are in an other predicament then damnation. But if to eate and drinke damnation, be spoken figuratiuely, where the sense is by eating to deserue damnation, why may not eating and drinking of the bodie and bloud of Christ, be spoken figuratiuely, where the sense is by eating and drinking, to be assured of saluation, wrought by the body and bloud of Christ? But no man is guilty (saith Sander) for doing more then he actually doth: therefore the vnworthye receiuer actually doth eate the bodye and bloud of Christ, whereof he is guilty. I deny the argument, which is a balde petition of ye principle, for the vnworthye receiuer is guilty of the bodye and bloud of Christ, not for eating and drinking it, but for eatig this bread vnworthily, &amp; so contemning the body of Christ, or not discerning the Lordes body, as the Apostle saith. The antecedent is also false: for a man is guilty especially in the sight of God, for his euill mind, purpose, affection, which often are more then actually he doth. As in ye similitude of abusing the Princes seale, which I vsed in the Chapter last before. But Sander exclaimeth against the shamelesse interpretation of heretikes, which imagine that S.

Although we say, that he is guiltie of Christs bodie, which contemneth the same in his Sacrament: and either receiueth it negligently, or els refuseth to receiue it contumeliously. For, not only the reprobates receiue vnworthily, but sometimes also the elect, of whome the Apostle especially speaketh, disswading them from receiuing vnworthily, wherby, as by other sinnes, they pro uoke God to punish them, &amp; deserue eternal damnation, if god should deale with them according to their deserts. But to condemne a man for eating the bodie of Christ, who did eat only the figure of it, semeth great vniustice to Sander. And yet the scripture neuer saith, that any mā is condemned for eating the bodie of Christ, but for eating the Sacrament vnworthily, he is guiltie of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, wherof that is a Sacrament. Tush (saith Sander) if it were so meant, the talk of Saint Paul would no more hang together, then if it were said: he yt toucheth vnworthily the kinges garment, is guiltie of murthering his person. I answer, first the Sacrament of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ is a thing yt more neere cō
                     cerneth Christ, then ye kings garment doth concerne the king, &amp; therfore the similitude is nought: but yet he yt wt contempt toucheth the kings garment, is guilty of cō
                     tempt of the kings person. And he that of malice, thrusteth his weapon through the kinges garment, might iustly be guiltie of murthering his person: euen so, and much rather, as the neglect or contempt of the Lords sa crament is lesse or more, so much is the guiltines against ye Lords person, although his bodie &amp; bloud be no more touched by the contemners, then the kings person, by ye abusers of his garment, image, crown, scepter, seal, or instrument. Sander after this, professeth, that he is loath to heap vp in this place the manifold witnesses of the auncient fathers, cōcerning that euil men eat Christs body, whose words he hath partly touched before, li. 2. Cap 3.

                        uell feareth the vertue of the consecration or blessing, lest perhaps it might haue kindled a sparke of grace, or of repentance in his minde. But the words of Cyrill, howsoeuer it bath pleased M. Sander to mangle them, are thus: 
                        Timet, vt credo, diabolus ne morando locus poenitentiae detur: &amp; quasi a temulentia mentem suam rectius cogitans homo cripiat, hac de causa festinat &amp; impellit. Nam etiam Iudam cùm post panem omnino se parauerit, tum moram tum benedictionis virtutem timens, ne scintillam in animo eius accenderit, ac inde illuminauerit, &amp; ad meliora retraxerit, magna praecipitem agit ecleritate. The diuel, as I think, feareth, lest by tarying place might be giuen to repentance, &amp; the man thinking better, might deliuer his minde, as it were from dronkennes. For this cause he maketh haste &amp; driueth forward. For with great celeritie, he driueth euen Iudas hedlong, when after the bread, he had altogither prepared himself, fearing both the delaie, and the vertue of ye blessing, least it hath kindled a sparke in his minde, and thereof hath lightened him, and drawen him to better thinges. This saying of Cyrillus doth no lesse differ in sense and vnderstanding from Sanders slanderous report of him, then it doth in forme &amp; context of wordes, from that which Sander affirmeth to be his saying. For Cyrill plainly caleth it bread which Iudas had receiued. Again it was the vertue of the blessing, and not ye presence of ye body of Christ, which the diuel feared. What is this for the reall presence?

                  First, he laboureth to proue that the fault of the Corinthians, Fulke. was not malicious contempt of Christ, but such contempt as riseth of negligence and lack of discretion. Thē he reasoneth thus: because S. Paul chargeth them to be guiltie, not onely of Christes worship and name, but also of his owne bodie and bloude, with which fault he neuer burthened any other then the vnworthy receiuers, or the Iewes that laide iniurious hands vpō Christ at his death, it must needes be, that such a communicant receiueth Christs naturall bodie. I answere, not onely they are guiltie of Christes bodie and bloude, which receiue the communion vnworthily, and which laide violent handes on Christes person, but euen they also, that crucifie the sonne of GOD againe, of whom the Apostle speaketh, Heb. 6. verse. 6. and corrupt the bloud of his Testament, by which they are sanctified wholy. Heb. 10. vers. 29. Neither are they burthened with a greater fault, then they committe, which vnworthily receiuing the pledge of Christes presence, are saide to offend against Christ himselfe. But Sander vrgeth the argument of discerning further: because the Apostle biddeth them put a difference betweene Christes bodie and all other meates or creatures in the world, it is euident, that none other mea
                           •
                        e or creature is present besides the bodie of Christ. I deny the argument, which followeth as this. He that despiseth circumcision, hath broken the couenant of God, as God saith Gen. 17: ergo circumcision, is nothing but the couenant of God, and not an outward seale and signe thereof. He that despiseth Baptisme, despiseth the bloude of Christ, and the spirit of God, by which baptisme is sanctified: therefore the water of baptisme is the bloud of Christ or the holy Ghost really. Wherefore he yt discerneth not the Sacrament, which is called, and to the worthy receiuer is in

                     hough intreating of so high a mysterie, hee speaketh many times figuratiuely and hyperbollically. as Hom. 6. he saith, The Church in which the sacramentes are ministred, is the place of Angels, the place of Archangels, the palace of heauen, heauen it selfe. Nam &amp; hîc

                     No figure which is not in substance Christes body, can make Sander. any man by eating it negligently, guiltie of Christes naturall bodie.
                  
                  Sander confesseth, that when a man by willfull contempt Fulke. doth breake or defile ye kings image, it is reputed all one, as if he had striken the prince himselfe, not because the deede is one, but because his will is vttered no lesse in abusing the signe, then if he had iniuriously touched the prince himselfe. But he saith, this similitude is not like, because saint Paul maketh his argument rather vpon the reall fact it selfe, then vpon the will or minde of the dooer. I answere, there is no worde in saint Paul, to prooue that he maketh his argument vpon the reall fact, which is eating and drinking, but vpon eating

and drinking vnworthily, which is with a will and mind not discerning the Lords bodie. Secondly Sander obiecteth that the Apostle speaketh not, of wilfull contempt, but of negligent doing. I answere, the argument holdeth as well or neglecting, as of contemning, yt which Ch
                        〈…〉
                      commaunded to be regarded, although it be a greater fault to contemne, then to neglect.
                  Secondarily (saith Sander) they yt say the signe, image, or figure of Christs bodie is abused, must shewe wherein yt figure doth consist, and then he maketh a metaphysical discourse of figures and images, external &amp; internal &amp;c. But I wil plainly shew him wherin the figure doth consist: not that breade and wine in any thing that the eye discerneth, in forme or shape, are like to Christs bodie and bloude, but in the vse and ende of them, which is to nourish bodily, as the body and bloud of Christ broken and shedde for vs, is made spirituall meate and drinke to feede and nourish vs spiritually, of which spirituall feeding and nourishing, the bread and wine, being sanctified to that vse, are not a bare, naked or emptie signe, Image, or figure, but a fuil perfect, and effectuall seale, confirmation and assurance to as many as receive y• same bread and wine, being nowe made so high a sacrament worthily. Neither is there any other presence or Christs natural body required therin thē in baptisme of his body and bloud, where vnto we are incorporated thereby, then in any of the sacraments of the old Testament, namelie, then in Manna, or the shewbread: of which Sander speaketh. But it is a thing neuer heard of (saith Sander) that either Manna or the shew breade vnworthily eaten, or baptisme vnworthily taken made any man guiltie of Christs owne bodie and bloud: therefore there is some other substante vnder the formes of bread and wine, then was in Manna &amp;c: Although ye scripture saith not in so many words, yt he that did eate Manna vnworthily, was guiltie of y• body of Christ, yet in effect it saith the same, and the same by necessarie consequence, may be inferred. He that did eate the same spirituall meate, yt we do, vnworthily, was so guiltie: the fathers did eate the same spiritual meat vnworthily, for God was not pleased

                        b 3. cap. 34. saith, that Christ by the figure of Manna was giuen vnto those old fathers. The like by Analogie, is prooued of all other sacraments. But Sander replyeth, the

                     ewes must then haue prepared &amp; examined themselues

                     uerie day, which is not reade of: who doubteth, but the Godly Iewes so did, that receiued Christ by the figure of Manna and the Rocke? and it is reade, yt they which did not receiue those sacraments worthily, were therefore ouerthrowne in the wildernes. Why then (saith Sander) if it were so, it had required more perfection in the law, then nowe is vsed forsomuch as we receiue our maker perhaps but once a yeare, and surely at the most but once a day, wheras they did eate Manna as often as hunger prouoked, for 40. yeares. The Law which is spirituall, requireth more perfection then any man can performe: but to argue what perfection is required of vs by that we vse corruptly, is as grosse a fault in reasoning, as theirs was in vnworthy receiuing. The scripture requireth oftner communicating then once a yeare. In the primitiue Church they receiued euerie day, &amp; so often they were to prepare and examine themselues. And what if I say, that euerie day, although a man doe not receiue, hee ought to vse as great preparation and examination of himselfe, as when he doth receiue? But wee receiue but once a day, at ye most (saith hee,) verily they receiued oftner, because it was not onelie a spirituall meate, but a bodily meate also necessarie for the maintenance of their liues, as our Sacrament is not, wee may eate breade which is not the Sacrament, so coulde not they at that time. Howe be it, when so euer wee come into the presence of God to pray, which wee ought to doe more then once a day, I would know, what preparation or examination, is necessarie for them that receiue

the Sacrament (excepting the onely relation of receiuing) but a Christian man is bounde to vse the same as precisely when he offereth his prayers vnto God. I speak not (as Sander doth) howe vnreuerently men vse to pray, but how they ought to behaue themselues in the sight of God.
               
               
                  CAP. XII.
                  
                     The reall presence of Christs bodie is confirmed by the oft repeating Sander. of the name of flesh, bodie, bloud, eating, drinking, and such like wordes.
                  
                  And why is not the reall presence of breade and wine Fulke. prooued by the oft repeating the names of breade and cuppe, and the fruite of the vine: as for eating and drinking, are more proper for breade and wine, then for the bodie and bloude of Christ, of which they cannot be saide, but figuratiuely: especiallie, seeing you hold, that the bloud of Christ in the cuppe, is not really separated from his bodie, howe can you properly say, that the bloude of Christ is drunke, when onely the bodie with the bloude in it, is swallowed downe the throate? Saint Paul calleth the Sacrament breade at the least sixe times, after consecration. As for the often repetition of flesh and bloude, in the 6. of saint Iohn, pertaineth nothing to the Lords supper. But let vs see master Sanders autorities, for this argument of repetition. First Euthymius borrowing the saying out of Chrysostome, saith: Hoc dixit, This he saide, confirming that he spake not obscurely, or parabolically. Yea sir, but Euthymius saith otherwise, if it had pleased you to cite his saying whole:  
                        Caro mea verè est cibus. Verus est cibus siue aptissimus, vtpote animam qu
                              •
                            propriissima hominis pars est nutriens. Et similiter de sanguine. Aut hoc dixit confirmans quod nō aenigmaticè, neque parabolicè loqueretur. My flesh is meate in deede, it is true meate or most apt meate, as which nourisheth the soule, which is the most proper part of man. And likewise of the bloud. Or else he saide this confirming that hee spake not obscurely

or in parable. Chrysostome in Ioan. Hom. 46. Quid autem significat: caro mea verè est cibus, &amp; sanguis meus verè est potus? Aut quod is est verus cibus, qui saluat animam: aut ut eos in praedictis confirmet, ne obscurè locutum in parabolis arbitrarentur. What meaneth this: my flesh is meate in deede, and my bloude is drinke in deede? Either that he is the true meat, that saueth the soule: or else that hee might confirme them in that was saide before, lest they shoulde thinke that hee had spoken darkely in parables. By both these places, which are disiunctiue sentences, it is plaine that the flesh and bloude of Christ is meate to feede the soule, which must needes be spiritually, because the soule cannot eate carnally, and then you see howe plaine and without parable the speach of Christ is to be taken.
                  Next these are cited Oecumenius 
                        
                           in. 1. Cor. 11. Per hoc quod frequenter ait (corporis &amp; sanguinis domini) manifestat, quod non sit nudus homo qui immolatur, sed ipse dominus &amp; factor omnium: vt videlicet per haec ipsos exterreat. By this yt he often saith (of the bodie and bloud of our Lord) he sheweth that he which is offered, is not a bare man, but ye Lord himselfe, and maker of all thinges: to the ende verilie that he might put them in a terrour by these thinges. This writer affirmeth nothing, but that the breade, and cuppe is not the sacramēt of a bare man, but of him that is both God and man: therefore not the bare substance of breade (saith Sander.) I confesse, but a Sacrament of the flesh and bloude of the sonne God.
                  Thirdly he citeth Saint Basil de Baptism. lib. 2. cap. 3. Vehementius simul
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         horribilius &amp;c. The Apostle setteth forth and declareth more vehemently, and more fearefully, the condemnation, by repetition. What is this to the reall presence? But Augustine de opere Monachorum cap. 13. saith: Neque enim &amp;c. For it is not said in one place or shortlie, so that it may be drawen or peruerted into another meaning by the ouerthwarting of neuer so subtil a Sophist. But what, I pray you? that mē ought to work with their hands. Doth not this make much for the reall presence, confirmed by oft repeating of the names of bodie and

bloud? when bread and cuppe &amp;c. be as often repeated?
                  But to conclude, Cyrill in Ioan. lib. 4. cap. 11. writeth in the same sense (saieth Sander) Non obdurescamus &amp;c. By Master Sanders leaue, I will repeate the wordes of Cyrillus, a little more at large, that wee may see in what sense he writeth.

Wherefore our sauiour by diuerse kinds of speach, sometimes enigmatically and obscurely, sometimes cleerely and plainely, hath set forth the same thing vnto the Iewes, so that they cannot bee excused if they start backe: but being euill men, might be destroyed euilly, as they that with their owne hande thrust a sworde into their owne soule. Therefore he cryeth out againe plainely: I am the breade which came downe from heauen. That was a figure, image, and shadowe onely. Heare you this which is clearely spoken: I am the liuing breade, if any man shall eate of this breade, hee shall liue for euer. Therefore let vs not harden our selues, hearing the trueth so ofte of Christ. For it is not to be doubted, but they shall suffer most extreme paines, who receiue not these things so often repeated of Christ.
                  
                  Out of this place first I note, that sometimes Christ spake in this Chapiter obscurely, and figuratiuely, contrarie to that which Sander before woulde seeme to affirme out of Euthymius and Chrysostome. Secondly, that Cyrillus speaketh not of the wordes, whose repetition Sander vrgeth, but of the matter of our spirituall feeding by Christ onely, often repeated in the sixte of Iohn. Thirdely that Cyrillus vnderstandeth the

matter of this Chapiter to bee all one, contrarie to that which Sander before hath stoutly defended, that Christ speaketh not of the Sacrament, vntill hee come to that saying, And the breade which I will giue, is my flesh.
                  Fourthly, that Cyrill affirmeth Christ to haue beene the breade of life which was receiued of the godly Fathers, vnder the figure of Manna: And last of all, that the wordes following, And the breade which I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the worlde, Cyrill vnderstandeth of the death of Christ, and not of the sacrament, for which Sander straue so much in the thirde Booke.
                  The saying of Cyrillus vpon the wordes of Christ: And the breade which I will giue, is my fleshe, &amp;c. is in the 12. Chapiter of the same Booke.  
                        Morior inquit pro omnibus, vt per me ipsum omnes viuificem, &amp; caro mea omnium redemptio fiat: morietur enim mors morte mea, &amp; simul mecum natura hominum resurget. I dye saieth hee for all men, that by my selfe I may giue life to all, and my flesh may bee made a ransome of all: For death shall dye by my death, and the nature of men shall rise againe together with me. You may nowe iudge in what sense Cyrillus writeth, and howe farre the sense of Sander is from the meaning of Cyrillus.

               BEcause the adoration of the Sacrament doeth most of all conuince the reall presence, Sander pretendeth that he hath appointed this booke seuerally to proue that poynt, whereas in deede hee laboureth for the most part to prooue the adoration by the presence, which is a beggerlie crauing of the principle, or that which is in question.

                  The adoration of Christes bodie, is no question betweene vs, but whether the sacrament is to be adored, yt 
                     Fulke. thereby the reall presence might be proued. The place of the Psalme 22. after the Hebrewes, is this, verse 26. I will paye my vowes before them that feare him. The poore or meeke shall eate, and be satisfied, they shall praise the Lord seeking him: your soule shall liue for euer. All the ends of the earth shall remember, and be conuerted vnto the Lord. And all the families of the Gentiles shall bow themselues before thee. Because the kingdome is the Lordes, and he hath dominion among the Gentiles. All that be fat on the earth, shal eate, and bow downe themselues, before him they shall all fal downe, which descend into ye duste. In this prophetical Psalme Christ proseth three things, that the faithfull shall bee sedde and nourished by him, that they shall praise God and that they shall haue eternall life. But for as much, as Christ nourisheth the faithfull, otherwise then by the sacram
                        •
                     t, it is great violence to draw this prophecie, only, or chiefly to the sacrament, as Sander doth. As for adoration of the sacrament, heere is no colour for it. Christ promiseth plainely, that such as he hath redeemed shall praise Iehoua, shall worship him, fall downe before him: but of worshipping the meate whereof they eate and are satisfied, there is no mention in the worlde. I passe ouer his fantasticall application of the words of the Psalme, and meddle onely with yt which is pertinent to the question. But the kingdome of God requireth an inuisible presence (saieth Sander) concerning the person of the king. But yet visible concerning the formes of bread &amp; wine, to the end his mebers may know where to worship him. And must wee haue ye visible formes of bread and wine, that we may know where to worship him? Why, doe wee not knowe, that he is ascended into

heauen, and sitteth on the right hand of God the father? shall wee not worship him sitting at the right hande of god in heauen? S. Paul willeth vs to seek those things that are aboue, where Christ is, and not those things that are on earth, because Christ is in heauen. Col. 3. But that this interpretation of the Psalme, to be meant of the sacrament, is not of Sanders inuention, we must heare the iudgement of the elder writers. And first he beginneth with Hierome in Psal. 21. Vota Christi: 
                     The vowes of Christ are his natiuitie, and passion: the vowes of the church are good workes: or els I will offer the mysterie of my bodie and bloud, with them who celebrate those things in his feare. Although this writer referre the text partlie to the mysterie of the bodie and bloud of Christ in the Sacrament, yet hath he no worde of adoration of the Sacrament: but reserreth it altogether to God and Christ, beside that his exposition farre differeth from Sanders explication. The like sayings he alleageth out of Augustine, Cassiodorus, Beda, &amp; Euthymius, all which affirm this prophesie of eating, to perteine to eating the body of Christ in the Sacrament, although not onely to it. But what say they to adoration of the Sacrament? Forsooth (saith Sander) manducauerunt &amp; adorauerunt, are both referred to one thing, they haue eaten the Sacrament, therfore they haue adored the Sacrament. I deny the maior: the text is plaine, that they haue adored, bowed, and fallen downe to God, &amp; not to that which they haue eaten. If I say, Sander hath eaten &amp; giuen thanks: do I mean that he hath giuen thanks to his meate, or to him that gaue him meate? This is a miserable argument. But S. Augustine doth fortifie it. For he saith vpon that Psalm, Euen the rich of the earth haue eaten the body of ye lowlines of their Lord, neither are they so filled as y• poore, euen vnto imitation, sed tamen adorauerunt, but yet they haue adored. I heare that they haue worshipped, but I heare not that they haue worshipped or adored the Sacramēt. And if you say they haue worshipped or adored the bodie of their Lords humilitie: how proue you, that they worshipped ye same really present in the Sacramēt?

Or that the Sacrament may be called ye bodie of ye lords humilitie? If this wil not serue, Augustine is more plaine

                         before, the poore shal eat &amp; be filled. But here it is said, all ye rich of ye earth haue eaten &amp; haue adored. For they also are brought to the table of Christ. And they take of his bodie &amp; bloud. But they adore only, &amp; be not filled also, because they follow not. For although they eat Christ the poore man, yet they disdaine to be poore. And againe, because God hath raised him from the dead, &amp; hath giuen him a name which is aboue euery name, yt in ye name of Iesus euerie knee shold be bowed, of things heauenly, earthly, &amp; vnder ye earth. They also moued wt the fame of his highnes, &amp; with the glorie of his name, (which glorie is spred round about in the Church) they come themselues to ye table, they eate &amp; adore, but yet they are not filled, because they do not hūger &amp; thirst af ter righteousnes. Al this while I heare adoring of Christ, but not of the Sacrament, nor of the bodie of Christ really present in the Sacrament. I would haue al men that eat the Sacrament, not only to eat, but also adore &amp; giue thanks, not to the Sacrament, but to him that spiritually feedeth vs by the Sacrament. But 
                        •
                     eda expoundeth ye adoring thus: 
                        Adorabunt, quia cum quadam exteriori veneratione accedent. They shall adore, because they shall come wt a certein outward reuerence or worshiping. Although Beda liued in a corrupt time, yet ye Sacrament in his time was not worshipped. Therfore, he speaketh of a certeine outward reuerence, yt men vsed in comming to the lords table, which is vsed of all them that worship not the Sacrament. For if Beda had meant as Sander woulde haue him, he should not haue said, a certeine externall worshipping, but wt all honor &amp; worship, both inwarde and outward, which we must vse, when we come to worship Christ himselfe.
               
               
                  CAP. II.
                  
                     The adoration of Christs bodie is proued againe out of the Prophet Sander. Dauid, Psal. 98.
                  
                  The Latine text is, Exaltate Dominū Deū nostrum, &amp; 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      
                     Fulke.
                     
                     scabellum pedū eius, quoniam sanctū est. Exalt ye Lord our God, &amp; worship his footstoole, because it is holy. Sander cōfesseth, ye Hebrew readeth: because he is holy. So might he haue confessed, yt the Hebrew readeth: worship at the stoole of his feete, which is at ye arke, tabernacle, or tēple which is called by Dauid. 1. Chr. Ca 28. the footstoole of Gods feete. And yt the sense of this verse is all one with y• last verse of ye same Psalm, which euen the vulgar Latine interpreter readeth thus: Exaltate Dominum Deum nostrum, &amp; adorate in monte sancto eius: quoniam sanctus Dominus Deus noster. Exalt ye ye Lord our God, &amp; worship in his holy mountaine: because ye Lord our God is holy. In both verses is one word of worshipping, the same preposition before ye word, yt signifieth his footstoole, and yt word which signifieth his hil or mountaine. Therfore ye Latine interpreter should not haue said worship his foot stoole, but worship in or at his footstoole, as he saith, in or at his holy hill. Wherefore, ye Prophet Dauid in this place speaketh nothing for worshipping of the bodie of Christ any way, if his own words, rather then the words of ye translator be considered. Wherfore the foundatiō of this worship of the Sacrament, is vtterly ouerthrowen. But Sander saith, that the Arke &amp; the temple being the footestoole of God, toward which, the Iewes did pray, did signifie, that the flesh of Christ should be adored, not only in heauen, but also in the Sacrament, which is the arke, temple, &amp; vessel, conteining the self same substance of Manna, which sitteth at the right hand of God the Father. Did I not tell you in ye preface, yt he would not proue the presence by the adoration, but the adoration by the presence, which is all in question? who shall grant yt the Sacramēt is such an arke, temple, &amp; vessel, as he affirmeth? But many of the old fathers, vnderstood the footestoose for the bodie or flesh of Christ, affirming yt it was to be worshipped. To this I answer, first, they were all deceiued in their ground of scripture, that so tooke the footestoole. Secondly, some of thē affirming ye flesh of Christ is to be worshipped, had no relation vnto ye sacrament. Thirdly, they yt said it was to be worshiped in ye sacrament, vnderstood worshipping otherwise then ye Pa pists teach &amp; practise, namely, for reuerencing of Christs

flesh in the mysteries, without any imagination of carnall presence. Hierom, the first author cited by Sander, for this purpose in Psa. 98. saith, There be many opinions of the 
                           •
                        ootstole, what it should be. But heere the Prophet meaneth our Lordes body, wherein the maiesty of the diuine nature standeth as it were on a footstoole.
                  
                  This is spoken of the humanity of Christ, without any respect vnto the Sacrament, therfore it followeth: 
                        Quid autem adorari debeat, &amp;c. And that he ought to be adored: the Apostles taught at his ascension, when they returned vnto Ierusalem worshipping. But also these thinges are to bee referred to our Lordes crosse and to his holy soule. The next is Ambrose de Spir. Sanct. lib. 3. Cap. 13. Per scabellum, &amp;c. By the footstoole, the earth is vnderstanded, by the earth the flesh of Christ: which at this day also we adore in the mysteries: which the Apostles as we haue said before, did adore in our Lord Iesus: for Christ is not deuided, but one. Here (saith Ambrose) the flesh of Christ is adored in the mysteries: he saith not that the mysteries are adored as the flesh of Christ. Christ is honored or contemned in the poore, in his Ministers, in Magistrates, in his word, in al his creatures: It followeth not, that Christ is really present in the poore, in his Ministers, in Magistrats, in his word, in all his creatures. Neither can it be prooued, that by mysteries, Ambrose meaneth only the Sacrament of Christes supper. Againe when he saieth, wee worshippe the flesh of Christ in the mysteries, which the Apostles worshiped in Iesus Christ, it followeth, that the mysteries and Iesus Christ are diuerse thinges, and not all one. But when the same Christ is worshipped in the mysteries, that was worshipped in his proper person, it followeth as Ambrose saieth, that Christ is one and not deuided. Thirdly, is cited Augustine, in Psa. 98. who interpreting the footstoole to bee the flesh of Christ, which he hath giuen vs to be eaten to saluation, saith: 
                        Nemo autem illam carnem manducat, nisi prius adorauerit, &amp;c. And no man eateth that flesh, except he haue first adored it, it is found out, how such a footstoole of our Lordes may be adored, and that we should

not only offend in adoring, but we should sinne in not adoring. Here Augustine saith, the flesh of Christ must be adored before it be eaten: and who doubteth of that? For hee that honoureth not Christe come in the fleshe, shall neuer be nourished by his flesh and bloud. But Augustine is so farre of, to teach vs that Christs flesh is to be adored, as really present in the Sacrament, that he doth expresly denie, his naturall body and bloud to be eaten and drunken, for thus hee saith to the Capharnaites in the person of Christ: as euen Sander reporteth: ye shall not eate this body, which you see, nor drink that bloud which they shall shedde, who shall crucifie mee. I haue commended a certeine Sacrament to you, being vnderstoode spiritually it will make you liue. Although it must needes be celebrated visibly, it must be vnderstanded inuisibly. Howe thinke you Sander auoydeth the force of this place? First he saith, the last words must agree with the first, and then both are true. Very well, he spake before of a spirituall manner of presence, and eating of Christ in the Sacrament, because he now denieth the corporall presence. Secondly he answereth, that Augustine speaketh of the visible forme, and not of the substance of the body of Christ, which is inuisible. O abhominable impudence. Augustine saith, you shal not eate this bodye, nor drinke that bloud. Sander saieth: These wordes body and bloud, are taken for visible formes, and not for the substance. 
                           ••
                        r Christ tooke not that greatnesse and quantity of flesh of his mother, wherein he walked: for his greatnesse increased from the state of an infant, to the state of a perfect man. But I pray thee Sander, if with shamefastnesse thou hast not lost all thy wit, tell me whether Christ was crucified in the state of an infant, or in the state of a perfect man? Augustine denieth the eating and drinking of that body which was crucified, and that bloud which was shedde, when he was crucified, which body also he demeth, that the Church hath present vpon earth. in Ioan Tr. 50. Tsll me whether it was the visible forme of bloud which was shedde on the crosse, or the very substance of his bloud. If thou say it was the very substance, which thou must

say, except thou be a Marcionite or Manichee, then it was the verie substance of his bloud, which Augustine denyeth to be drunken in the Sacrament.
                  But Augustine (saith Sander) was so fully persuaded, that the fleshe of Christ was to bee adored vnder the forme of bread, after consecration, that he reacheth the Christian people to adore it, not as common flesh, but as the flesh of God, for whose sake we adore it. Cù

                     3. &amp; 9. Thirdly, it presupposeth, that Christ gaue occasion by his owne word, that Idolatry should be committed to bakers bread, &amp;c. Christ gaue none occasion to worshippe bread, more then to worship a dore, or a vine tree. Last of all, it is a most foolish thing to say the Bishop of Rome was the cause of that worshipping, and also to teach that hee is Antichrist. Nothing more agreeable to reason, then that Antichrist should set vp an Idole, that he himselfe by it might aspire to the greatest honor. But Antichrist (saith Sander) is an aduersary, and setteth himselfe against Christ, but the Pope calleth himselfe the vicar of Christ, and the seruant of seruantes. Vnder the colour of these titles, he arrogateth to himselfe power and honor aboue Christ, to giue pardō in papers sealed with lead, a poena &amp; culpa, when he teacheth, that the pardon yt Christ sealed with his bloud, is only a culpa, frō ye fault, but not from ye punishment. And yet the Popein his Canon lawe, refuseth not to be called God aboue al Gods.
                  
                     
                     Secondly, Antichrist aduaunceth himself aboue all that i

                     Thirdly, Antichrist shall shew false signes and wonders to deceiue wicked men by. So hath the Pope &amp; his members do

                      an infinite number, wherof the Legends, &amp; other lew

                     Fourthly, Antichrist is aduaunced aboue all idols, th

                         shall set vp no idoll but himselfe, therefore, if the Pope set

Augustines time, which was 400. yeres? or be al the gentiles such at this day? yea, were there not of thē that were called Christians, worshippers of Images in S. Augustines time?

See then if Sander haue any shame to cite Augustine, for his purpose, which is, yt no Idolatrie can bee committed since Christes time, especially of them that are called Christians. Beside Augustine, hee abuseth the name of Athanasius de in

Thirdly the Gnostikes had Images painted in colours, and some of golde and siluer and other matter, which they saide were the Images of Iesus made vnder Pontius Pilate whē he liued among men. Epiph.

Finally the Collyridians committed Idolatrie vnto the Virgine Marie. Epipha. cont. Collyrid. Haer. 79. Beside so many false Christians as in S. Augustines time worshipped

pictures &amp; sepulchres. And to omit them yt worshipped Images in France, whō Gregorie vnto Serenus affirmeth to haue committed Idolatrie, although he disallowed the breaking of the Images.
                  But Papists are not so insensible (saith Sand.) to worship bread made with the bakers hand. why not? as well as to worship metal, wood, &amp; stone, in your images. yet Chrysostome saith, there were fewe cities left in his time, in which Idolatrie was vsed: &amp; there is no citie in Christendome where ye sacrament, hath not ben worshipped (saith Sander) for so many hundreth yeares. Yes sir, where the Waldenses were in Calabria, in France, Boëmia, &amp; other places, your bread worship preuailed not. And God be thanked, there are nowe many hundred cities, in which yt Idolatry is not openly cōmitted, except it be by stelth in corners, &amp; so no doubt, but heathenishe Idolatrie, was cō
                     mitted in most cities in ye world in Chrysostomes time, considering what number there were of heathen men, in all places. Therefore where Sander saith, yt all Christians for euer haue worshipped the sacramēt as yt very body &amp; blod of Christ, is vtterly false, seeing it is not much aboue 300. yeres, since Pope Honorius made ye decre of yt kind of worship, which Sand. defendeth: which decree had ben in vain, if al Christiās for euer had worshipped it. But Sand. at length asketh, if ther be no idolatry in Christendō? he answereth to much of inward idolatry, but no outward idolatry at al. Inward idolatry he coūteth, couetousnes &amp; heresies: so was Luther ye first idolater of our age: thē Zuinglius, thē Caluin, &amp; the sacramentarie english idol, ye vanitie of which assertion, to haue cited, is abundanly to haue cōfuted. He concludeth, yt 
                     to say yt 
                     the blessed sacrament of Christ is an Idol, seemeth necessary to employ, that Christ instituted an Idol. This implicatiō must come frō such a senseles Idol, as Sand, is, for otherwise they yt haue eies &amp; see, &amp; eares &amp; heare, can easily conceiue, yt an holy sacramēt instituted by god, by abuse of Idolaters, may be turned into an Idol, as was the brasen serpent, &amp; therefore was broken by Ezechias. Neither did Christ giue any occasion of Idolatrie, by his wordes in the supper, more then God did by his commaundement in the wildernes.

                           〈…〉

                  The Apostle saith, the vnworthie receiuer, eateth and drinketh damnation, not putting a difference betweene Fulk. our Lordes bodie, and other meates (saith Sander.) And this difference is in two pointes, the first in due preparation of our selues, which is required in other sacramentes to receiue the grace of God, the seconde is, in respect of the substance of the meate, that is receaued, which is to be honored and adored. I answere, the earthly substance is not to be adored, the heauenly substance is to be adored in heauen where it is really present, and not vppon the earth: and as well in Baptisme, as in the supper. But Chrysostome in 1. Cor. Hom. 
                        •
                     8. saith, hee eateth vnworthily: who considereth not as it behooueth, the greatnes of the things set forth, not weighing diligently the greatnes of the gift. Hee speaketh not of the effect (saith Sander,) but of the substance of the Sacrament: because he saith afterwarde: If thou doest learne diligently who is s
                           〈…〉
                         foorth: thou needest to account nothing else. I aunswere that admitte he speaketh of the heauenly substance of the Sacrament, that is Christ, yet he aduocheth no reall presence of him vnder the formes of bread and wine, for Christ is set foorth in all his Sacramentes, both of the olde Testament and the newe. Christ washeth vs in baptisme euen as hee feedeth vs in his supper, and hee purgeth vs with his bloode, as verily, as hee feedeth vs with his bodie and bloode. Neither doth Ambrose in 1. Cor. 11. meane any other thing: when he saith, Wee must iudge that he is the Lorde, whose blood we drinke in a mysterie. For to drinke the bloode of Christ in a mysterie, is to drinke it spiritually, by meane of a Sacrament, euen as to bee washed with the blood of Christ in a mysterie, is to bee purged by the bloode of Christ, by meane of the Sacrament of Baptisme.

                        •
                     o God, as is the humanitie of Iesus Christ our Sauiour. But Chrysostome saith further, in 1. Cor. Hom. 24. The verie table is the strength of our soule, the sinewes of the mind, the bond of confidence, our foundation, hope, health, light, life. I answere, this is nothing else, but the effect of our redemption, whereof we are assured, by participation of that table. As for the heauenly substance, that it is in heauen, Chrysostome sufficiently declareth, when hee affirmeth in the same Homily, that we must become eagles, and flee into heauen, for where the dead bodie is, thither wil the eagles be gathered. Wherefore the adoration, that is defended cannot be prooued by the true substance of the sacrament considered, but by the reall presence and personall vnion thereof vnto the outward elementes: which if Sander cannot shewe, hee laboureth in vaine, to tell vs of the true substance of the sacrament, which wee confesse to bee the bodie and bloode of Christ, vnto the worthie receiuer: but not personally vnited to that breade and wine, or the shapes of them. But nowe let vs heare, what he hath to say, out of Saint Augustine, Epi. 118. ad Ianuarium: who answereth the question: Whether they doe better, that receaue the communion euerie day, or they which at certaine times onely. 
                        Neuter eorum exhonorat &amp;c. Neither of them depriueth the bodie and bloode of our Lorde of honour, if each of them

striue who may honor best, the most healthfull sacrament. For as well the Centurion as Zacheus did honor our Sauiour in manner by contrarie meanes: the one by receiuing him with ioie into his house: the other by saying, Lorde, I am not worthie, that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe. And as among the Iewes, Manna tasted to euerie man, according to his owne will, in the mouth of the faithfull: euen so it is to bee iudged, concerning the receiuing of that sacrament, into euery Christians mouth. For both one man for honor sake, doeth not take it euery day: an other for honors sake, dareth not to omitte to take it in any daie: As Manna would no loothsomenes, so this meate will no contempt. For the Apostle for that cause saith, it to haue beene vnworthily receiued of them, Qui hoc non discernebant a caeteris cibis veneratione singulariter debita, which did not discerne this thing, from other meates by a veneration singularly due. For streight, when he had said, he eateth &amp; drinketh damnatiō to himself: be said moreouer, Not discerning our Lordes bodie, the which appeareth sufficiently in all that place in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, if it be diligently marked. This place to Sander, seemeth merueilous notable, for honor due to the sacrament. And who is he that thinketh the sacrament not to bee honorable? Verily hee that honoreth not the sacrament of baptisme, is an heretike: and yet hee that adoreth the water of baptisme as the holy Ghost, or as the bloode of Christ, is an idolater. But Sander hath no lesse then ten obseruations of this place, which for tediousnesse I will not rehearse all, but onely such as in which I dissent from him. In the fourth obseruation he noteth, that we must striue to honor the sacrament, whether by this meane or that it skilleth not, so it be honored. If he vnderstand of those two meanes, of which Augustine speaketh. I agree with him, if he meane that it skilleth not by what meanes so euer we honor the sacrament, I say, he hath no such grounde in Saint Augustine. In the fifth obseruation he saith, If it were in deede the substance of bread and wine, hee would neuer exhort vs to bee so carefull, howe to

honor a meere creature, were it neuer so great a signe. I answere, we honour not a meere creature, when we honour the sacrament, for his sake that instituted the same: for we honour God, and yet the earthly substance of the sacrament is indeed the substance of bread and wine. We honor not a meere creature, when we honor a magistrat, and yet the magistrate, in substance is a man. In ye ninth obseruation, he asketh what is a veneration or worshipping singularly due, but such a worship, of which sorte there is but one, and in the tenth hee saith, such a worshipping that onely is, which is due to God: who as he hath no fellow in nature: so he hath no partaker in honor. I aunswere, the veneration, honor, worship, or reuerence, due singularly to the sacrament, is spoken of Augustine in comparison of all other meates, and not of all other thinges in generall. His wordes are, Which did not discerne the sacrament, from all other meates by a reuerence singularly due to it, that is to say, of all other meat, onely the sacrament ought to haue that reuerence or honor: Euen so the water of baptisme must bee discerned from all other waters, veneratione singulariter debita, by a veneration or reuerence singularly due vnto it, being consecrated to the mysticall washing away of our sinnes, and yet no diuine honor must be giuen to the water of baptisme. Wherefore S. Augustine meaneth nothing lesse, then that the sacrament shoulde bee worshipped as God &amp; man, really present vnder those visible shapes of bread &amp; wine, as Sander impudently doth slander him. But it is worthie to be remembred (saith he) That Augustine vseth the word Sacramentum, for the substance of Christes fleshe conteined vnder the signe of bread. Who wil graunt this vnto Sander? well, if you will not graunt it, he hath reason to prooue it. For Augustine (saith he) would neuer haue granted, that either the substance of materiall bread, or the forme thereof, ought to be honored. For honor can be giuē to no vnreasonable creaturs. Is this that Sander, which defendeth the honoring of images? or else be images reasonable creatures? But hee careth not what he saith, so he may seeme to say something, to the matter in hande.
                  
                     
In deede Augustine woulde neuer defende that diuice honor shoulde be giuen to the sacrament, but there is a kinde of honor, which may bee giuen, euen vnto the vnreasonable creatures, not in respect of themselues, but in respect of him, to whome all honor, and glorie is dewe, if they be of him taken and appointed to any honorable vse.
                  Last of all, we must consider, what it should meane, that Augustine saith, The Sacrament may bee honored by our absteining, sometimes from receiuing it into our mouthes, whereas it is no honor to God, if wee shoulde any moment absteine to feede on him by faith, and in spirite. Therefore it is a worthier kinde of substance, which is receiued in the sacrament, then the grace is which is the effect of spirituall eating. For his grace cannot come, except wee first bee made meete to receaue it. But his bodie maye come to our bodies, and so maie condemne vs, before we are meete to receiue it. To this friuolous collection I aunswere, that there is no honor done to the Sacrament, by absteining from it, but by humilitie, as the similitude of the Centurion declareth, who counted himselfe vnworthie that the Lorde shoulde come vnder his roofe. Againe, Augustine defendeth not the acte of either of both partes, as good of it selfe, but making that to be indifferent, he onely defendeth their intent and meaning, which was to yeelde due reuerence to the Lordes sacrament, the one by often receauing, the other by humble intermission, least the offences, shoulde in their weake nature, breede contempte of so high a mysterie. For although wee ought continually to feed on Christ by faith, yet it is not necessarie, nor conuenient, nor possible that the pledge and seale of this spirituall feeding, shoulde euerie moment be receaued. But only at such times, as the Church &amp; Elders thereof shall thinke expedient, for the renuing of our remembrance, and confirming of our faith by the visible tokens of Christes institution. So that no worthier substance can bee gathered to bee receaued in the Sacrament, then the grace of God. And where Sander saith, that his grace cannot come, except wee bee first made meete to

                     
                        〈◊〉
                      I answere, that we are not made meete to receiue the grace of God, but onely by the grace of God preuenting all preparation of our owne. As for his bodie comming into our bodies, when it is prooued out of the worde of God, it shalbe graunted, but not before.
                  Finally, whereas he gathereth it is the same substance of Christ, which is receiued: of which ye Centurion said, I am not worthie yt thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe: I answere, he may no more vrge the substance of Christ, in the one similitude of the Centurion, then he wil alow me to vrge it is not the same substance, by the other similitude of Manna, which Augustine likewise vseth. As for the same words of the Centurion, vsed in the Lyturgie, ascribed to Chrysostome in adoring the sacrament, I denie that any adoration is meant vnto the Sacrament, or that those wordes are spoken vnto the Sacrament, but vnto Christ in heauen, whose Sacrament that is. What is said or done in the Masse booke, I neither knowe, nor care. That Origen Hom. 5. in diuersos, exhorteth them that receiue the Sacrament, to vse that speach of the Centurion, it prooueth neither adoration, nor carnall manner of presence. For immediatly before, he hath these wordes: 
                        Inerat &amp; nunc dominus sub tectuns credentium, duplici figura vel more. Nunc enim quando sancti &amp; Deo acceptabiles ecclesiarum antistites sub tectum tuum intrant, tunc ibidem per eos dominus ingreditur. Et in sic existimas tanquam dominum suscipient. Et aliud: quando sanctum cibum, &amp;c. The Lorde doth now also enter vnder ye roofe of the faithfull in a double figure or manner. For nowe when the holy and acceptable to God, the rulers of the Churches, doe enter vnder thy roofe, then euen there, the Lorde by them doth enter. And thinke thou, euen as receiuing the Lorde him selfe. And againe, when thou receiuest that holy and incorruptible meate &amp;c. Beholde Origen saith, Christ entreth in a figure, and after such manner as he entreth by his ministers: of which entrance, hee teacheth man likewise to say, Lorde I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe: therefore this saying importeth no substance of the naturall bodie of Christ

really present in the sacrament.
               
               
                  CAP. V.
                  
                     That the fathers of the first sixe hundreth yeares after Christ Sander. did adore the bodie and bloude of Christ in the sacrament of the Altar.
                  
                  The first, which is Dionysius, falsely called ye Areopagite, Fulke. could be no writer of ye first 600. yeares, whom neither Euseb. nor Hieronymus, nor Germadius, gatherers of all ecclesiasticall writers, before their time did knowe, Concerning his saying, I referre the reader to mine answere to Heskins, lib. 2. cap. 47. As for Pachymeres cannot be elder then his autor Dionyse, on whom he writeth his Paraphrasis. The next is Cyprian, which lib. 2. Ep. 3. saith, that our sacrifice is Christ: but Christ is to bee adored (saith Sander:) ergo the sacrifice which is the Sacrament. I answere, whatsoeuer after any manner is called Christ, is not to be adored. Whosoeuer receiueth any of Christs disciples, receiueth Christ: but hee shalbe an Idolater, if he giue diuine honour to him, which is due onely to the person of Christ. The like answere I make to that Ambrose saith, de ijs qui myst. cap. 9. that Christ is in the Sacrament: To Ignatius, Ep. ad Rom. calling the Sacrament the breade of God, the heauenly breade, the breade of life: To Euseb. lib. 10. cap. 10. calling it a Sacrifice full of God, and the dreadfull Sacrifices of Christes table: To Cyrillus, lib. 3. in Ioan cap. 37. saying, that by the mysteries wee are made partakers of the diuine nature. Neither doe the sayings of Cyrillus, nor Hilarius, lib. 4. cap. 18. prooue a personall vnion of Christ with the Sacrament, when they say it maketh Christ to dwell in vs corporally, and by a naturall participation: for they say not so simplie, but vnder a Sacrament, vnder a mysterie: &amp;c. that is, the Sacrament doth assure vs, that wee are truely made partakers of the bodie and bloude of Christe, after an heauenly and diuine manner, and not onely are ioyned

to him in loue and faith, and will, but are made flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, by his incarnation and holy spirite, vniting vs vnto him, in a mystical bodie, not in a personal vnion: for if any thing which is truely the bodie of Christ, must be adored with diuine honour, the Church of God should bee so adored, which is the bodie of Christ, and so called in the Scripture.
                  Finally Hesychius calling the Sacrament the breade of life, and the mysticall loaues, which quicken vs, &amp;c. gaue no diuine honour vnto it, as personally vnited vnto Christ, but as to an holy mysterie, and seale of our spirituall feeding and coniunction with Christ. For Hesychius affirmeth, that mysterie to bee both breade and flesh, in Leuit. lib. 2. chap. 8. But Sander vppon these sayings, buildeth that the Fathers affirmed, that which was on the table, to bee the diuine substance, yea the substance and nature of God which is to be adored, and cannot be eaten corporally, but in the Sacrament. And yet no one father, that hee hath cited, saieth any such thing. If Cyrill say, we are by the mysteries made partakers of the diuine nature: Saint Peter saith by Gods promises we are made partakers of the diuine nature, 2. Pet. 1. Yet not of the diuine substance: And to saye, the Godheade can be corporally eaten, in the Sacrament, it is monstrous heresie. When Cyrillus saith, Christ dwelleth in vs corporally, hee saith not by eating the Sacrament, wee eate GOD or Christ corporally, but the power of the mysticall blessing maketh Christ to dwell in vs corporallie, by participation of the fleshe of Christ.
                  But let vs yet heare a more full witnesse, which is Chrysostome in 1. Cor. Hom. 24. the place although it be fully answered by mee against Heskins lib. 2. cap. 45. yet because Sander maketh so manie obseruations vpon it, I will set it downe againe. Hoc corpus &amp;c. The wise men reuerenced this body in the manger: and being men without good religion and barbarous, they worshipped it with feare and much trembling after a long iourney

taken. Let vs therefore who are the citizens of heauen, at lest follow those barbarous men. For when they sawe, the manger and cottage, and not any of those thinges which thou nowe seest: they came with most great reuerence and quaking. But thou seest that thing, not in the Manger, but in the Altar: not a woman which might hold it in her armes: but the Priest present, and the holy ghost copiously spredde vpon the sacrifice which is set foorth: Neither lookest thou barely vpon the bodie, as they did: but thou knowest the power of it, and al the order of dispensing thinges. And thou art ignorant of none of these thinges, which were done by him, and thou hast beene diligently instructed in all things. Let vs be stirred vp therefore, let vs quake, and let vs professe openly a greater deuotion, then those barbarous men: lest if we come barely, and coldly, we ieoparde our head into a more vehement fire. Out of this place Sander would haue the reall presence and adoration of the sacrament prooued. But this place prooueth neither of both. For he speaketh figuratiuely, of seeing the bodie of Christ, of seeing the holy ghost spredde vpon the Sacrifice, &amp;c. which cannot bee referred to the eyes of the bodie, but must needes haue a spirituall vnderstanding. The bodie of Christ is so present, as it may be seene, but it cannot bee seene but spiritually, therefore it is not present but spiritually. This is sufficient to shewe that Chrysostome spake not of the popish reall presence, therefore not of their manner of adoration. Nowe let vs see what wise arguments Sander can picke out of this place.
                  First we must note these comparisons: The Altar, the Manger, the Virgin, the Priest, the Wisemen, the Christians, the adoration of the one and the other: but this last comparison is forged, for Chrysostome requireth our imitation of the wise men, in comming to the Sacrament with reuerence and trembling, with earnest desire and affection, not in giuing honour to the outwarde creatures, but to him yt is seene by faith. Further, Sander chargeth him to say, it is ye same bodie in both places, which Chrysost. saith not, although it be the same body which

is receiued spiritually in the Sacrament, wt that which ye wise men did worship: yet it followeth not, yt the same real body is present vpon the altar before it be receiued, to bee there worshipped. Sander vrgeth Chrysostomes words, vides in altari, thou seest it on the altar. Lo it is vpon the altar, and not onely comprehended by faith, but by the meane of the forme of bread it is seen. What say you, Sander? is the body of Christ seene? then is hee present visibly. It is a madde kinde of corporall sight of his bodye which is through the forme of bread. You were wont to tell vs, that a substance is said to be seen, where the proper accidents thereof are seene. And are the accidents of bread the signes now of the body of Christ? O newe Philosophy and Theology! but I pray you sir, if the body of Christ be not only comprehended by faith, but also seen by meane of the forme of bread: by what meane is the holy ghost seen? whom Chrysostome likewise affirmeth to be seen as the body of Christ is. Will you neuer be ashamed of those impudent shiftes, in wresting the holy scriptures, and sayinges of the ancient fathers? As for the foure reasons that Christian men should rather worship the Sacrament, then the wise men did Christ in the cottage, be in vaine. For Chrysostom draweth no example of their worshipping, to worshippe that which is visibly seene in the Sacrament, or the elementes thereof, but of comming with reuerence vnto the bodye of Christ, which is really in heauen, whereof we are made partakers after an heauenly and spirituall manner in the Sacraments, not by bringing the body of Christ downe vnto vs, but by our ascending vp vnto him, as Chrysostome sheweth plainly, by that long allegory of the Eagles, which he vseth in the 24. Homily. Neither doth Chrysostome say, that as those vngodly barbarous men, did worshippe his body in the manger, and handes of a woman, so we being godly and ciuil, must worshippe it lying on the altar, or in the priestes hands, in the forme of bread. But he exhorteth by this exāple, his auditors, to come often, decently, &amp; with dew reuerence &amp; preparation, to the participation of the holy mysteries,

                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
in which the same body of Christ (though after an other manner) is seene and dispensed.
                  But Chrysostom saith more plainely, Hom. 28. I will shewe thee that in the earth, which is worthy of highest honor. Where can he shewe it (saieth Sander) but on the altar, pointing to the host? Yes forsooth, he can shew it to the eies of faith: for to the bodily eies he can shew nothing but breade and wine, which is worthy of small honour. But yet it followeth more plainely, As in the pallaces of Kinges, not the walles, not the golden roofe, but the Kinges body f
                           •
                        tting in the seate of maiestie, is the worthiest thing of all: so is the body of Christ the worthiest thing in heauen, which is now sett forth to the earth, to be seene. What could ye greatest Papist in Europ say more, quoth Sander? Verily no Papist that is aduised what hee saith, will say the body of Christ is set forth on earth to be seene, but onely by the eies of faith: and so the Lord of all thinges, is shewed by preaching, by ministring of the Sacramentes, but not to bee seene with eies of the body, but with ye eies of ye mind. Wherfore seing Christ is set forth to be seene on earth, which sight cannot be but by faith, Chrysostome meaneth of a spiritual sight, shewing, &amp; manner of presence, and not of a bodily sight, shewing, or manner of presence. Neither doe we inuent any shiftes, as Sander saith, to auoide the adoration in question, for it shall neuer be prooued, that the Sacrament was adored in the primitiue Church, in such sort as it is worshipped and commanded by the Papistes. But beside Chrysostome, wee must haue a plaine authority of Theodoret, who disputing against an Eutychian, that denieth the humanity of Christ, reproueth him by the example of the Sacrament, wherein two thinges are found: (saith Sander) but Theodoret saieth there are two natures and substances, breade and wine, and the body and bloud of Christ. 
                        Neque enim signa mystica, for the mysticall signes after sanctification, depart not out of their nature. For they remaine in the former substance, figure and forme.
                  
                  But now heare ye shameles glosse of Sander. In substance,

because the formes of bread and wine subsist, by the power of God, and haue their being now by them selues, as they had it before in the nature of bread and wine. So that in substances is not in substance, but in accidentes, wherevpon it will followe in Theodorets argument, that Christ hath not now the substance of his humanity, but the substance of accidents thereof. Secondly hee saieth, The formes remaine in their former nature, because they nourish no lesse, then the substance of bread it selfe would haue done, if it had remained.
                  
                  And is it the shapes or formes of bread and wine that nourished before, while the substance remained? was it the former nature of the formes, to nourish? O monster of impudency! If the substance and not the shapes did nourish, the shapes now nourishing as this new Philosopher affirmeth, remaine not in their former nature, but haue taken vpon them a newe nature, which no formes or shapes beeing accidents euer had before. But hitherto Sander hath done nothing, but by intollerable impudence, sought to shift of the authority of Theodoret, which is so plaine and direct against transubstantiation.
                  Now followeth the place for adoration, which he citeth in Greeke, for more credit 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      &amp;c. The mystical signes are vnderstoode to bee those thinges, which they are made, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and are beleeued &amp; reuerenced. Sander had rather say, adored as being those thinges which they are beleeued to be.
                  
                  Heere can be no lesse, then reall presence and adoration. And yet Theodoret meaneth neither of both in such sorte as Sander would haue him. The mysticall signes are spiritually the bodye and bloud of Christ, so to be beleeued and so to be esteemed, reuerenced, honored, and adored, not by any actuall conuersion of the elementes into the bodye and bloud of Christ, but by the grace of God making the same spiritually, which the signes represent outwardly.
                  And so shal Theodoret expound himselfe, Dialogo primo,

Qui enim &amp;c. He which called his naturall body, wheat and bread, and nameth himselfe againe a vine, euen hee hath honoured the tokens that are seene, with the name of his body and bloud: not changing their nature, but adding grace vnto the nature. And whereas Sander concludeth vpon the place by him cited: Therefore worshippe is not giuen to them as to images, which represent a thing absent: It followeth immediatly after the wordes by him cited 
                        
                           Dial. 2 Cenfer ergo imaginē cum exemplari, &amp; videbis similitudinē. Oportet enim figurā esse veritati similē. Compare therefore the image, with the paterne or sampler, and thou shalt see the similitude. For the figure must be like the trueth. Theodoret calleth the same mysticall signes, which are reuerenced, the image, and the figure, which represent the body of Christ, which is the principal sampler, whereof the Sacrament is an image, and the trueth, whereof the Sacrament is a figure. Se you not what reall presence he maintaineth? Who so will more at larg see Theodoret cited and obserued, he may reade the 52. and 56. Chapiters of mine answere to the third booke of Doct. Heskins.
               
               
                  CAP. VI.
                  
                     The adoration of the body and bloud of Christ is prooued by Sander. the custome of the Priestes and people of the first 600 yeares.
                  
                  First he citeth the liturgies of Iames, Clement, Basil, Fulke. Chrysostom, all which beare conterfeit names, and yet say nothing to the purpose. They report that the deacon said let vs be attent with the feare of God, and with reuerence. What is this for adoration? we also charge men to come wt feare &amp; reuerence, to ye cōmunion. Again, ye Priest said before ye receiuing of the cōmunion, Sancta▪ sanctis, Holy things, are for holie men. Sander laboreth to prooue, that they spoke of the Sacrament, as though we denied that the Sacramental! bread and wine were holy things, when they are consecrated to be the body and bleud of Christ, to the worthie receiuers.
                  
                     
But Chrysostome ad pop. Antioch. Hom. 61. vppon the same saith: 
                        Considera, &amp;c. Marke, I pray you, the kingly table is set before the Angels ministring at the table, the king himselfe is present, and thou standest by idle. Thy garments are foule, and thou carest not. But if they are cleane, then adore and receiue. This adoration Sander would referre to the holy things, but he cannot enforce it, wee adore and communicate, yet wee adore not the Sacrament.
                  Chrysostome in the same Homilie saith: that we eate him which sitteth aboue, which is worshipped of Angels, &amp;c. by which it is euident, that the presence of Christ in the mysteries, is after a spirituall manner, not that he is bodily present. As for the eleuation, and the things praised with an hymne, that Dionysius speaketh, although they prooue no adoration of the Sacrament, yet I will not stande vpon them, because it is cleare that Dionysius was a writer out of the compasse of sixe hundreth yeres, that Sander hath bound himselfe vnto, howsoeuer the Papistes impudently woulde affirme, that he was Saint Paules scholler, whose writinges were not heard of in the Church for sixe hundred yeres after Christ. Next Dionysius the counterfeit Areepagite, followeth Basil 
                        
                           de spiritu sancto. Cap 27. Inuocationis verba, &amp;c. The words of inuocation vsed in the shewing of the breade of the Eucharistie, and the cuppe of blessing, which of the Saintes haue left in writing to vs? In that place in deede Basil defendeth ceremonies receiued by tradition, which are not contrarie to the worde of God, among which he nameth the wordes of inuocation, which wordes Sander will haue to be the order of saying Masse, and prayers, and yet after referreth to certeine wordes, which the people aunswered, when the Priest saide, Holy thinges are for holy men. One is holy (saide they) one is the Lorde, one Iesus Christ in the glorie of GOD the father, with the holy Ghost, Amen.
                  But these are wordes of declaration, who is holy, not of inuocation. Wherefore the wordes of inuocation

were some prayer that was made for the worthie receiuing of the mysteries, and not made to the mysteries, as Sander imagineth. And wheras vpon the worde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , he would not onely grounde shewing of the mysteries, readie to be receiued, but also lifting vp of them, it is a simple argument, for 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      doeth not so properly (as he saith) betoken a shewing, by lifting vp, as to ordeine, to institute, to appoint, and so wee neede not vnderstand any shewing, but an appointment, or ordering of the bread and cuppe to be the Sacrament.
                  Passing ouer Maximus and Germanus, two late writers, concerning the shewing and eleuation of the mysteries vsed in their time, I come to Eusebius Emissenus, 
                        Hom. 5. in Pasc. Cùm ad reuerendum altare salutari cibo potúq
                              •
                           , &amp;c. When thou commest vnto the reuerend altar, to be refreshed with the wholesome meate and drinke: Looke with faith, vpon the holy bodie and bloud of thy God, honour it, wonder at it, touche it with thy minde, take it in the hande of thy heart, and especially, receiue it with an inwarde swallowing.
                  
                  This place being altogether of spirituall beholding, honouring, &amp; receiuing, yet is not Sander ashamed to cite it for carnall presence, and ad oration of the Sacrament. But howe I pray you? forsooth, hee telleth vs where to haue it: on the altar. Naye sir, faith respecteth not things that are visible, therefore not the altar, nor that is seene vpon it, but him that is in heauen, which is represented by that which is seene corporally.
                  Nowe, seeing the beholding must bee with faith, and the receiuing with the hande of the heart, and inward swallowing: who will graunt vnto Sander, that the honouring must bee with outwarde reuerence, to that which appeareth breade and wine, but with inwarde and spirituall reuerence, dewe to Christ which is in heauen?
                  But Sander hath a quarell against the English Homilies, for translating altare the communion, and salutari cibo potúq
                           •
                        , spirituall meates. I thinke the writer meant

not to translate, but to giue ye sense: but I know not what Sander meant in translating this place, for that which Eusebius sayeth, Cordis manusus
                           •
                        ipe, to giue none English at all, but leaue it cleane out. As for the saying of the receiuers, Lorde, I am not worthie that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe, it hath beene shewed alreadie, howe it was vnderstoode of Origen, and may be saide of them that neuer meant to adore the Sacrament.
                  And whereas Sander sayeth, none other Lorde entreth vnder the roofe of his mouth, beside that breade: I marueile, whether he meane to teache vs, that tectum is Latine for the roofe of a mans mouth, whereas wee haue alwayes taken it for the roofe of an house. Christe is sayde to enter vnder the roofe of our house figuratiuely, when hee dwelleth in vs by faith spiritually. As for eating vnder the roofe of our mouth, it is a grosse imagination vnworthie of the maiestie of Christ.
                  The last author is Cyrillus of Ierusalem in Catech. Mystag. 5. who biddeth the communicants, to take the king and the bodie of Christ in the hollow of the right hande, saying, Amen, and to sanctifie their eyes therewith, vsing all diligence, that no crumme thereof perishe or fall away. What needed that precept (saith hee) if it were common bread?
                  Verely, I take it for a meere superstitious precept, although it were giuen to young nouices, newly admitted to the communion: and yet it prooueth not the Popish reall presence, vnlesse you thinke a legge or an arme falleth off, if a crumme be lost. What, when a mouse eateth vp all in the Pixe? And what can it be but the substance of breade which hath crummes, that may fall from it?
                  Cyrillus in the same place sayeth: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . For whatsoeuer thou shalt leese, it is manifest, that in it thou hast lost as it were, parte of thine owne bodie.
                  
                     
I thinke you will not say, that the bread is changed into the bodies of the communicants, that in leesing a crum, they leese a parte of their bodies. Hee meaneth therefore a spirituall reuerence to be giuen to the holy mysteries, which was signified in careful keeping of the external figures. Well, after the communion of the bodie, Cyrillus biddeth the people come to the chalice of Christes bloud, bowing downe, and saying in the manner of adoring &amp; worshipping, Amen. If he bad the people come to the chalice of Christes bloud, he was no Papist, &amp; though he bid them come bowing downe, &amp; saying in worshipping. Amen: yet you finde not that he biddeth them bowe downe to the chalice, or to adore that which is in it, as you do. We come to the communion with reuerent gesture and bowing downe, yet we adore not the Sacrament. But if hee meant adoring of the Sacràment, why did he not bidde them bow downe and worship the bread, as well as the cuppe?
                  Finally, that Cyrillus acknowledged no transubstantiation, it is plaine by his words in the same booke: where hee sheweth yt after the ministers of ye church are sanctified by the spirituall hymnes that were song, they besought their louing God to sende his holy spirit vpon the things that were set foorth, and to make that bread the bodie of Christ, and that wine the bloud of Christ. Then it followeth, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . For whatsoeuer the holy Ghost hath touched or embraced, that must needes be sanctified and changed. You see Cyrillus meaneth no change of substance, but such as is in all thinges that the holy Ghost commeth vnto. Where it is saide in the Actes, the Apostles returned adorantes, worshipping, wee may safely vnderstande, that they returned worshipping of Christe, as well as of the Father and the holye Ghost: but here is no like assurance, that the Sacrament is to be worshipped, therefore adorantes is not of necessitie or congruitie to be referred vnto it.
               
               
                  
                  CAP. VII.
                  
                     Thereall presence of Christes bodie &amp; bloud vnder the forms Sander. of bread and wine, is proued by the testimonies of the auncient.
                  
                  The sayings of the doctors, because he hath alreadie Fulke. alleaged in euery article &amp; Chapter, he professeth nowe briefely to shewe, by what generall Chapters a man may be vndoubtedly assured of their beliefe &amp; doctrin. And first, because diuerse of them alleage the almightie power of God to defende the veritie of those wordes and deedes: I answere, that allegation prooueth no real presence. For the almightie power of God is more considered in feeding vs with the bodie and bloud of Christ, which is in heauen, then in Popish transubstantiation. Yet Sander misunderstandeth Irenaeus, li. 4. ca. 34. as hee misquoteth lib. 5. for lib. 4. How can they be sure, the breade wheron thankes are giuen to be the bodie of their Lord, &amp; the cup of his bloud, if they say not him to be the sonne of the maker of the world? In these wordes Irenaeus reasoneth not of the diuine power of Christ, which the heretikes granted, but they denied him to be ye sonne of that God, which made ye world: therfore, by the institutiō of the Sacrament in bread &amp; wine, which are creatures of the world, Irenaeus proueth, that the father of our Lord Iesus Christ, was the maker of the world, &amp; not another iust God, as the heretikes affirmed. Cyprian in deede in serm. de coen. Dom. allegeth the omnipotencie of God for that wonderful conuersion of the nature of common bread, to be made the flesh of Christ: but he meaneth not transubstantiation, but an alteration of the vse of the creature, to bee a meane to feede spiritually with the flesh of Christ, as by the whole discourse of that Sermon it may appeare. Hilarie, li. 8. de Trin. alleageth ye diuinitie of Christ, to proue the Sacrament to be truely flesh and bloud: which wee grant, as he affirmeth vnder a mysterie, and after a spirituall manner. Finally, Basil in Reg. bre. q. 172. Ambros. de ijs qui init. Cap 9. &amp;c. Chrysost. de sacerdot. lib. 3. Emissenus hom. 5. in Pasc. Cyrillus in Ioan. li. 4. cap. 13. &amp; 14 places

often cited &amp; answered, do all vse the argument of omnipotencie, but not to proue the Popishe carnall or reall maner of presence, but to proué yt Christ doth aboue the reach of mans vnderstanding, feede vs truely with his flesh &amp; bloud, and as Damascene saith, by an inscrutable meane (for he had not learned transubstantiatiō, though otherwise he were a corrupt writer, in diuerse things) as he doth regenerate vs in baptisme.
                  The second general Chapter is, that no man requireth credit to be giuen to a figuratiue speach, but the fathers require credit to be giuen vnto it, therfore it is not figuratiue. I denie the major, for he that requireth not all the figuratiue speaches in ye scripture to be credited, in their true meaning, is an heretike. If these wordes had beene figuratiue (saith Sander) we should haue bene warned by the watch men of God to beware of them. Nay, to beware of misunderstanding them, so wee are directly by Augustine, De d
                           •
                        ct. Christ. lib. 3. Cap. 16. &amp; by others. And who is so madde to denye these wordes of the cup, to be figuratiue? This cup is the newe Testament in my bloud. Againe, there is neither Basil, Epiphanius, Cyrillus, Ambrosius, Chrysostome, Eusebius, or any other that requireth these words to be credited, but they also shewe, that they are spiritually and mystically to be vnderstanded.
                  The thirde generall Chapter is, that the fathers affirme the trueth of Christes flesh, and his flesh to be ea

                  The fourth Chapter general is, that they which name ye 
                     
                        〈◊〉

                     he substance of Christes flesh, from his supper, yet shewing the bread and wine to be signes, tokens, &amp; remembrantes, they exclude the Popish reall presence, vnder the accidents of bread and wine. For signes and the things signified must needs be diuerse, yea, opposite as relatiues. As when Cyprian saith: the diuine substance hath vnspeakably infused it selfe in the visible Sacrament, hee meaneth not the substance of Christes fleshe, nor of his godhead, but the grace of God giuen to the visible Sacrament. D

                         Coen. Dom. And when Hilarie saith: Wee take the flesh of his bodie vnder a mysterie, he meaneth not, that the accidents of bread is a mysterie, but the whole dispensation of the Sacrament. Likewise, when Cyril of Ierusalem saith: vnder the figure of bread, the bodie is giuen: hee meaneth, that breade is so a figure of the bodie, that as the figure is giuen outwardly, so the bodie is receiued inwardly.
                  Augustine, de verb. Apost. serm. 2. The bodie and bloude of Christ shall then be life to euery man, if that thing which in the Sacrament is visibly receiued, be in the truth it selfe eaten spiritually, &amp;c. Behold (saith Sander) there is a thing in the sacrament, &amp; so really it is there, that it is visibly receiued. What a miracle Sander hath founde! but what thing is that which is visibly receiued, breade and wine, or the bodie of Christ? It must needes be the body of Christ (saith he) vnder the forme of breade, for nothing els is to be eaten spiritually. And is the body of Christe present inuisibly, as all Papistes affirme, and yet receiued visibly? This is strange Logike. But why may not the breade and wine be eaten and drunken spiritually, when they are by faith vnderstoode to be the sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, to feede the soule as they are corporally digested into the bodie? be not our soules washed spiritually by meanes of the water in baptisme?
                  
                     
The fift generall head. He that alleageth a cause why the flesh and bloud is not seene in the mysteries, presupposeth (although an inuisible) yet a most reall presence thereof. I answere the allegation of that cause, presupposeth no Popish reall presence, but sheweth that presence to bee spirituall and not corporall: as Ambrose doth plainly in ye place which is truncally alleaged by Sander, who taketh onely the taile thereof.

                           •
                        s bloud. That there may be no horror of raw bloud, and yet that the price of our redemption may worke. What argument can bee more plaine then this, that which we drinke is the similitude of his bloud, ergo it is not his reall bloud? As for Theophylact a late writer, I will not stand vpon his authority.
                  The sixt generall head. They that acknowledg a chang of the substance of bread into Christes body, must needes meane a reall presence of that body. I answere none of the ancient fathers, acknowledged transubstantiation, but a change of vse, and not of substance in the bread and wine. The places which he citeth of Iustinus, &amp; Cyprian, I haue satisfied before often times, namely Iustine, against Hesk. lib. 2. Cap. 43. and Cyprian lib. 2. cap. 28. 
                        〈◊〉

                  The seuenth generall Chapiter. All that affirme the externall Sacrifice of Christes bodye and bloude, must needes teach the reall presence thereof. I answere, none of the ancient fathers, teach the externall Sacrifice, but of thanksgiuing and remēbrance for the redemption by Christes death. The places of Dionysius and Eusebius Pamphili, which he noteth, are answered against Heskins lib. 1. Cap. 35. The councell of Nice hath bene satisfied

in this booke, lib. 2. Cap. 26.
                  The eight head, is the adoration lately confuted.

                  The 12. that they affirme Christes bodie to be on the altar, in the handes, in the mouthes, and the bloud to be in the cuppe. lib. 2. Cap. 5.
                  The 13. that they giue it such names, as onely may agree to the substance of Christ, &amp;c. for which he quoteth Cyprian de Coena Domini, answered by mee against Heskins, lib. 1. Cap. 29. And Chrysostome in 1. Cor. Hom. 24. aunswered in the fourth Chapter of this booke.
                  The 14. that they teache euery man to receiue the same substance in one measure and equall portion, for which he quoteth lib. 1. Cap. what is the supper, &amp; lib. 4. Cap. 12.
                  The 15. that they vse in shewing how it is sanctified, the verbs of creating, making, working, consecrating, representing, &amp;c. for which he quoteth Cyprian de Coen. Do. answered by mee against Heskins. lib 2. Cap. 7. Also Hierome in 26. Matth. answered against Heskins, lib. 1. Cap. 18.

                         fideles, least the infidels should mocke at it, for which hee citeth Augustine &amp; Chrysostome, is a feeble argument, to proue the reall presence, for other spake openly, euen to Infidels, as Iustinus &amp; Tertullian.
                  The 17. that they haue applyed it to the helping of ye soules departed, as being the verie selfe substance that ransaked hell, is false, &amp; not proued out of Aug. lib. Conf. 9. Ca. 13. nor Cyprian, li. 1. Ep. 9. as I haue shewed against Allen. li. 2. Cap. 9. &amp; Cap. 7.
                  
                     
The 18. that they taught it to be the truth which hath succeeded in place of the old figures, for which he quoteth Augustine de Ciuitate Dei, li. 17. Cap. 20. where no such matter is, but that the sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christ is offered in bread and wine in steede of all the old sacrifices, &amp; deliuered to the cōmunicants, by which he meaneth a sacrifice of thanksgiuing, and not of propitiation.
                  The 19. that they vsed by the knowne truth therof, to proue that Christ had flesh &amp; bloud, for which he quoteth Irenaeus, lib. 4. Ca.

                  The 20. that they haue farre preferred it before baptisme, that no crumme might be suffered to fall downe: for which he quoteth Cyrill. Catech. Myste. 4. answered in the Chapter next before.
                  The 21. that the catechumeni admitted to heare the preaching, might not sec the Eucharistie, that no man might eat it except he were baptized, and kept the commandement, and yet the catechumeni had a sanctified broad, which was a signe of Christ. For the former parte is cited Dionysins de Eccles. Hier. Cap. 3. for the later, August. lib. 2. de peccat. merit. &amp; remiss. Cap. 26.
                  To this I aunswere, that these ceremonies and obseruations partely friuolous, partely superstitious, are too weake argumentes to prooue the matter in question. So that in steede of the testimonies of the auncient fathers, wee haue little beside quotations, and vaine collections.

                     The reall presence of Christes bodie is prooued by the faith of the whole Church of God, in all times and all ages. Sander.
                     
                  
                  To omit that curious question, what shall become of Fulke. all our fathers that so long haue beleeued th'e reall presence:

&amp;c. it is a great vntrueth, that Sander affirmeth Berengarius to haue bene the first that preached &amp; taught against the reall presence. For the opinion of the reall presence was not taught before Antichrist was openly shewed in the see of Rome in any place, nor immediately after commonly receiued, but in the seuenth or eight hundreth yere, as superstition, idolatrie, and false doctrine began to increase, both in the East and West: it began to take strength, but yet not to be fully confirmed, as it appeareth in the writings of Damaseene, the seconde Councell of Nice, and other writers since that time. Neither was the errour then vnreprooued, for the Councell of Ephes. 3. which condemned images, gaue a true vnderstanding of the supper. Bertrame, whome Sander affirmeth to be but suspected in his booke De corpore &amp; sanguine Domini, which is extant for euery man to reade, plainly determineth against the Popish reall presence and transubstantiation.
                  And whereas Sander offereth a large scope, as he saith, that we should name one bishop in the whole earth, who before the time of Berengarius, reprooued the teachers of the reall presence, as heretikes: I can name none so conueniently as Aelfricke, sometime Archbishop of Canterburie, with al the Saxon bishops in his time, who set foorth an Homily to be read on Easter day vnto the people, and allowed certeine Epistles of the saide Aelfricke, in which is conteined a plaine and manifest denyall of that bodily presence, for which wee striue, and an approbation of the onely spirituall manner of presence, which wee teache.
                  If Sander will cauill, that although they so taught they reproued not the teachers of the reall presence as heretikes I referre it to the iudgement of all indifferent men, how they would haue accused any man that obstinately should haue maintained a doctrine contrarie to their common beliefe and consent. Howe the fathers of the primitiue Church beleeued, concerning the blessed Sacrament, &amp; namely S. August. (whom Sander half

suspecteth, and yet saith he is not against them, because his communion is not forsaken) it hath ben plentifully and often shewed, &amp; is not here to be repeted.
                  But Hilarie saith, it is the profession of our Lorde, &amp; the faith of the Church, that the Sacrament is truely the flesh and bloud of Christ: therefore there is no place left of doubting. Certeinly we doubt not, but to the worthy receiuer, the Sacrament is the same which Christ affirmeth it to be, after a spirituall manner: but wee are out of doubt, that our Sauiour Christ reteining the nature of his bodie, would not make the same insensible, impalpable, incircumscriptible, &amp;c. It is not therefore the presence, nor the reall presence rightly vnderstood, but the bodily presence, which we denye, and no man affirmed for sixe hundred yeres after Christ, except perhaps Marcus the heretike, that changed the colour of ye wine by inchantment, that it might bee thought that Christe had dropped his bloud into his chalice, as Irenaeus testifieth, lib. 1. Cap. 9.
                  Likewise, we aunswere to Epiphanius, we belieue the wordes of Christ to be true, which by grace hath giuen vs bread and wine to bee his bodie and bloud spiritually, euen as the water of baptisme to be regeneration, which similitude Epiphanius vseth, euen as he doth this of the supper, to shewe that wee are truely made according to the image of God, not by nature, but by grace. Epiph. Anch.
                  But Sander hath a pleasant similitude to shewe, that the Papistes are not gone from the Apostles, and auncient fathers, because a man liuing in these dayes, should be vniustly charged with treason, for disobeying of William the Conquerour, or being the sonne of him that disobeyed William the Conquerour, when he answereth, that he liued not vnder that king, and al his ancestours in their dayes were obedient to such kings vnder whome they liued. A worshipfull similitude. But if William the Conquerour made a lawe, that whosoeuer committeth these things, or these things, shalbe deemed

a traitour, and it is prooued that thou hast committed some of them, what will the former answere auaile thee? it is the doctrine, and not the persons of the Apostles and auncient fathers, from which you are accused to haue departed. But which of the successours of the Apostles (saith Sander) sent Berengarius to preach that doctrine, whereof they helde the contrary? I aunswere, so long as Berengarius taught that doctrine, which the Apostles themselues commaunded to bee taught, he needed no speciall commission from them yt were departed from the Apostles doctrine, to reprooue them, for he was sent of God, who opened his eyes to see the trueth, and their errours, that sitting in the chaires of the Apostles, taught a doctrine contrarie to the faith of the Apostles.
                  But Sander will at once prooue that all citizens of ye house of God, through the world, witnessed wt one voice, and in one worde, that they beleeued the bodily presence. For the olde custome was, at the wordes of consecration, and at the time of the receiuing the Sacrament, which was saide to be the bodie and bloud of Christ, to say, Amen: that is, to affirme it was so. And this Sander prooueth by manie witnesses, which is needelesse: for wee knowe it as well as he. But this prooueth no carnall nor bodily manner of presence, except Sander can proue, that it was tolde them, this to bee the body and bloud of Christ, without any figure, really, corporally, present vnder the onely shapes of bread and wine, as they teache nowe. Yes (saith Sander) a figuratiue speach soundeth otherwise, then we must thinke, whereto (Amen). must not be answered What shall wee then answere to these wordes of Christ, This cuppe is the newe testament in my bloud? are not these the wordes of consecration also?
                  But what was meant by Amen, and what the Sacrament is, S. Augustine teacheth 
                        
                           serm. ad infantes: Si ergo vos estis corpus Christi &amp; membra, mysterium vestrum in mens a positum est: Mysterium Domini accipitis ad quod estis. Amen

respond
                              •
                           tis, &amp; respondendo subscribitis. Audis ergo corpus Christi &amp; respondes, Amen. Esto membrum corporis Christi, vt verum sit Amen tuu
                              •
                           . &amp;c. Therefore if you be the bodie, receiue the Lordes mysteries, whereunto you are. You answere Amen, and by so aunswering, you subscribe. Be thou a member of the bodie of Christ, that thy Amen may be true. These wordes declare, that not the reall presence was aduouched by the worde Amen, but the spirituall participation of the mysticall body of Christ by the faithfull.
                  But Leo, Ser. 6. de Ieiu. 7. mensis saith, 
                        Sic sacrae, &amp;c, you ought so to communicate of the holy table, that ye dout nothing at all, of the trueth of the body and bloode of Christ, for that thing is taken in the mouth, which is beleeued in faith. And Amen is in vaine answered of them who dispute against that which is receiued. In these sayings Sander vrgeth, that it is receaued with the mouth, as though Leo did meane, that whatsoeuer was beleeued in faith, was receaued in the mouth, yet the worde is are sumitur, it is receaued by the mouth, which is not all one with, in the mouth. For the bodie of Christ may be receaued by the mouth, as by an instrument that receaueth the visible sacrament thereof, and yet the body is not receaued into the mouth. But Leo speaketh manifestly, against the Manichees, which denied that Christ had a true bodie: exhorting Christians not to doubte thereof, for except they beleeued faithfully, that Christ had a true bodie, they coulde not with their mouth receaue a sacrament of that body, which they beleeued not to bee, nor truely answere Amen, when they disputed against the trueth of that bodie whereof the visible sacrament was a signe, token, and argument, and so vsed by Tertullian, againste the Marcionites that likewise denyed the veritie of Christes body.
                  Wherefore in this Chapter, Sander prooueth nothing lesse then in the title he promiseth.

                  His title is of no man possibly, but his demonstration Fulk. is a simple poore man persuaded chanceably so by his teachers vpon coulour of Christes almightie power, and will pretended in promising, that he will giue his fleshe and wordes, in saying; this is my body. As for them that are simplie deceaued, they stand or fal to God, I will neither iudge of their condemnation, nor absolution. But such as obstinately defende, that error, contrarie to their owne conscience, as a great number of the Papistes, which pretende faith, and seeke nothing else but the ouerthrowe of faith, and the glorie of God, for as much as that error employeth a deniall of the trueth of Christes humanitie, and consequentlie the trueth of the resurrection of our bodies, which must be made like vnto the glorious bodie of Christ, and inferreth manifest Idolatrie in worshipping that for GOD, which is a meere creature: I see not howe they can escape eternall damnation. As for their defence which Sander maketh, is friuolous. First of the almightie power of God, which is to doe whatsoeuer he will, and is agreable to his glorie, and not whatsoeuer we will imagine. He can not therfore make his body to be in many places at once, or to bee without dimension of quantitie, or to bee inuisible and intangible, because hee hath determined of his will to the contrarie in fiue hundreth places of scripture. which testifie of the trueth of his humanitie, like vnto his bretheren in all poyntes, without sinne. Neither doeth it derogate from his omnipotencie, that hee can not doe contrarie to his will, which were against his owne glorie.
                  
                     
It is no infirmitie in God, that he cannot lye, that hee cannot sinne, that he cannot denie himselfe, nor doe contrarie to his will &amp; glory; but an argument of his power, wisedome, and goodnesse.
                  And whereas Sander saith, that Christ hath determined his will in saying: The bread which I wil giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for ye life of the world: I answere, hee hath determined no such will of giuing his flesh in the Sacrament by these wordes, but of giuing his flesh to suffer death for the redemption of the worlde, which is the bread whereof he speaketh so often in that Chapiter to be eaten spiritually by faith, not onely in the supper, but in baptisme, &amp; without both ye sacraments, by faith onely, which was eaten of all the faithfull before the incarnation of Christ, without the eating of which breade of life, no mortall creature can bee partaker of eternall life. Further, where Sander saith: that Christ saide, This is my bodie, and gaue his twelue disciples twelue fragments or peeces, whereby he shewed, that hee made the substance of his body present vnder ye formes of bread in diuers places &amp;c: I answere, he declared no will of multiplying his bodie in diuers places at one time by such words or fact. For seeing he had so often before testified, ye truth of his humanity, in somuch yt he termed himselfe vsually, the sonne of man, and afterward offered his body to be touched and handled for triall of ye truth of his resurrection: these wordes were not sufficient, to teach his disciples, yt his natural bodie could at one time be visible and inuisible, tangible and intangible, in locall situation and not in locall situation, to be whole in one place, and whole in manie places, to haue quantitie actually of length bredth, and thickenes, &amp; to haue no quantitie, actually of length breadth &amp; thicknes: these contradictions I say being against nature, reasō, sense, his former doctrine, and the scriptures touching the trueth of his naturall bodie, and his argument taken of the senses after his resu
                        •
                     rection, coulde not bee perswaded with onely saying, This is my bodie, for as much as they had hearde him saye manie thinges in like

phrase, where no like vnderstanding could be imagined, and the scripture speaking of the sacraments, vseth ordinarily to call them by the names of these things whereof they are sacramentes. Wherefore there is no doubt, but the disciples vnderstood these words figuratiuely, sacramentally, and spiritually. And concerning the fragments and peeces whereof Sander speaketh, he is a shamed to call them fragments or peeces of bread, as Cyrillus doth, of whom he borowed the phrase, lest he should acknowledge breade to be any part of the Sacrament. But what declaration can he make of the will of Christ, concerning transubstantiation of the breade into his bodie, which euen the schoolemen affirme, cannot be prooued out of the scriptures? And seeing Sander in his fond Dialogisme, induceth Christ saying: that one of his works cannot be contrarie to another: seeing his ascension, abiding in heauen, and comming from thence to iudgement, are contrarie to this imagined presence; and those articles are plainely and manifestly set forth to be beleeued: howe can these onely foure wordes, This is my bodie, which may haue another interpretation, agreeable to all the sayings and workes of God, make such a declaration of the will of Christ, as thereby the trueth of his humanitie remaining after it was assumed of the deitie and the resurrection of our bodies depending thereupon, the ascension, abyding of Christ in heauen, and his comming from thence to iudgement: although in words they be not denyed, yet are and must be brought in doubt, question and vncerteintie? The other false bragges of this interpretation, vniuersally receiued and alwayes taught and beleeued, I omitte, with his shameles slaunders of Luthers life, and death, wherof the one hath beene sufficiently, and many times confuted: the other is so well knowen, and to so manie wise and godly, with whom he liued and among whom he dyed, that next vnto the autoritie of the scriptures, no one thing more discouereth the falshood of the Papists, then their impudēt slanders and lyes, maliciously deuised against the true professors of the Gospel.
               
            
            
               
               The seuenth Booke.
               To the Preface.
               SAnder hauing finished the sixt booke, supposed to haue ended his labour, but then came forth the B. of Salisburies replie vnto Doctor Hardings booke, wherevpon he was moued to answere that article, which concerned the reall presence. But because the words of both their bookes were too large to bee inserted in this his volume, hee hath chosen the pyth of either (as hee affirmeth) with such fidelitie, as Master Iewell should finde no fault with him. For my part, I was likewise purposed to haue omitted the answere of this appendix, partly because Master Iewels defense of the Apologie, being set foorth after this booke of Sander, the chiefe matters are therein by Master Iewel himselfe wayed and answered: partly, because Sander, bringeth no newe matter in this replie, but either such as he hath brought in the sixe bookes before: and partly because his chiefe and most generall answere, is nothing, but a begging of the whole matter in controuersie, with an affirming and denying, grounded vpon his owne authoritie. By meanes whereof in this one article, he hath noted iump 218 vntruethes: howe well and iustely, let the readers of his booke, and Master Iewels replie, be iudges. As for mee, I will not examine them all, but onely so manie as touch the controuersie, with any shewe of argument, sauing that in a fewe of the first, I will giue the reader a taste, that hee may iudge of the rest. And whereas hee chargeth the Bishoppe for setting one trueth against another, for falsifying of autorities, for misconstruing of their meaning &amp;c: as the matters shall occurre, I wil not faile to consider them.
               
                  
                  CAP. I.
                  
                     Master Iewell hath not answered Doctor Harding well, touching Sander. the wordes of Christes supper in this article, Fol. 316. The people was not taught in the first sixe hundreth yeares, to beleeue, that Christs bodie is really, substantially, corporally, carnally, or naturally in the Sacrament.
                  
                  To giue a tast (as I promised) of Sanders collection of vntrueths, I will examine a fewe. Fulke.
                  
                  The first vntruth is noted to be this: Master Iewell said, Whether Christes body be corporally in the Sacrament, Harding answereth not one worde. Harding had saide, The termes really, substantially &amp;c. are sounde in the doctors, treating of the true being of Christs bodie in the Sacrament, Ergo (saith Sander) Master Iewell saide not truely: for hee prooueth afterwarde, Christes bodie to bee in the Sacrament. Heere the reason of this vntrueth is, the whole matter in controuersie, whether Harding haue proued in deed that which he intended.
                  The 2. vntruth. Iewell saith, in this matter hee is able to alledge nothing for direct proofe. Harding had saide, Christian people haue euer beene so taught, of that kind of presēce, which is founded vpon Christs plaine words: Ergo saith Sander, hee was able to alleage somewhat. But what, I pray you? That Christian people were euer so taught: which is false, that this doctrine is grounded vpon Christs words, which is false also. For what one doctor affirmeth the presence according to the article? Harding saith the three Euangelists and Saint Paul: Ergo saith Sander, there is ye thirde vntrueth: for M. Iewel hath words plainely written &amp;c. But if these words prooue the presence according to the article, the controuersie should be at an ende.
                  The 4. vntruth is, that M. Iewell saith, Harding vpon the wordes of the institution, foundeth his carnall presence in such grosse sort, really, and fleshly in the

Sacrament. Sander replieth it is lesse carnall, grosse, and fleshly, to haue the substance of Christs corporall flesh, in a spirituall manner, really present vnder the forme of breade, then to bee in his mothers wombe, as Marcion, and Apelles counted it, or to make a lye, when he saide, take, eate, this &amp;c: As though the graunting of Christes humanitie, prooued the Popish presence, which is contrarie to the truth of his humanitie, or that Christ might not say truely, the Sacrament to be his bodie, except it were after that manner, his bodie. His presence in spirituall manner, we graunt, but we vnderstande spirituall manner, to bee otherwise then inuisiblie, for manie thinges may be so present, that they are not seene, and yet be not spiritually, but corporally present.
                  The fift vntrueth is, that M. Iewell saith: Christ vseth no leading to that carnall presence.
                  Sander answereth: The word This, leadeth the Apostles to that vnderstanding, as if I say, this is a Lyon, it will followe vnder this visible forme, that I shewe, a Lyon is substantially contained, &amp;c. As right as a rammes horne. If I shew a king or a strong man, I may say truely in some sense, This is a Lyon. For if I shew one substance, and affirme another of it, the speach must needes be either false, or figuratiue.
                  The sixt vntruth, and a forged lye is, that Master Iewell saith, D. Fisher saith, this sense cannot in any wise be gathered of the bare words of Christ. Fishers words, as Sander reherseth them, are these: No man shall proue by the bare words of the Gospel, that any priest in these dayes, doth consecrate the true bodie and bloud of Christ. Againe. No worde is put whereby it may be prooued, that in our masse, the verie presence of Christs bodie and bloude is made. Iudge indifferentlie of the words, what lye Iewell hath forged. Although Fisher meant, that by the interpretation of the fathers, and practise of the Church, the vnderstanding of the Gospell is more certainely obtained: then by the bare words of the Gospell. But Fisher hath other wordes: Non potest igitur per illam scripturam probari, quòd aut laicus aut sacerdos quoties id negotij tentauerit, pari modo conficiet ex pane vinóque Christi

corpus &amp; sanguinem, atque Christus ipse conficit, cùm nec is
                           •
                        ud in scripturis contineatur: which M. Iewel beginneth to english thus, It cannot therefore be prooued by any scripture. Here Sander playeth the schoolemaster, and apposeth him. What cannot be proued M. Iewel? giue me the nominatiue case to the verbe non potest, it cannot, saith Sander. What cannot? Wherevpon is grounded the 7. vntrueth, when Iewel saith: Doct. Fisher saith, the carnall presence cannot be proued neither by these words (this is my bodie) nor by any other. But I put case Master Iewell woulde answere your deepe demaunde, in saying, that potest in this place, is a verbe impersonall, and therefore he can giue it no nominatiue case at all, but must english it thus, non potest it cannot. If you will aske him, why he saith then the carnall presence cannot bee prooued, as though presence were the nominatiue case: he will answere you, he doth not so construe, or translate the Latine, but he inferreth that conclusion, vpon Fishers wordes. No worde is put whereby it may be prooued, that in our Masse the verie presence of Christes bodie and bloude is made. But your learning, wil haue the whole speach following to bee the nominatiue. I say, let it so bee, if you will needes haue it so, yet Master Iewels conclusion is true: That Fisher affirmeth the carnall presence cannot bee prooued to bee made, either by laye man or Priest: ergo it cannot bee prooued at all. Yet saith Sander, Howe manie enormous faults haue you committed heere, master Iewell? First Harding affirmed these wordes, This is my bodie, to teach a reall presence: Fisher spake of these words, Make this thing, and not of these wordes, This is my bodie. This were an enormous fault, if Fisher had not saide, Non potest per vllam scripturam probari, it cannot be prooued by any scripture: but seeing he saide so, this is an enormous, slanderous, impudent, and foolish lye, and cauill of Sander. Secondly, Harding spake of the reall presence, if any sacrament bee made at al: Fisher, whether any man had autoritie to make anie Sacrament at all or no. When you can finde Hardings if, or condition, you shalbe answered to Fishers whether or question. Thirdly Harding spake of Christs words; Fisher

of our doings. If the scripture be not Christs words, Fisher spake onely of our doings. 4 Fisher doubted not but the wordes made the presence, but he asketh the heretikes howe they can proue it by the holy scriptures. Nay syr, he affirmeth precisely, that it cannot be proued by the scripture. These are the foure great enormous fault. I trust after this tast, no man is desirous to examine the rest of Sanders vntruthes, falsely fathered vpon Master Iewel. Wherefore I wil goe from henceforth onely to the matter in controuersie. Hitherto you heare not Master Iewels article disproued. Videlicet, that the people were not taught, &amp;c. as in the beginning of the Chapter. The question, being not of the wordes, but of the meaning, saith Iewel, Christ meant not this to bee his bodie really. Hereto Sander alleageth a place of Hilarie: lib. 8. de Trin. to proue, that Christ lacked neither wisedome, nor vtterance, to speak plainely of his Sacraments, and mysteries: which is verie true, for hee spake plainely, syncerely, and truely, although he spake figuratiuely. Neither did hee speake otherwise then he meant, seeing it is his bodie after a certaine manner, as Augustine saith.
                  But seeing heere are three or foure persons speaking: M. Iewel, M. Harding, M. Sander, and my selfe: it shall not be amisse to bring their seuerall speaches in forme of a Dialogue for briefenesse, as Sander giueth me example.
                  
                     Iewel.
                     Christ was the Rocke, but yet not really.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     S. Paule spake not these wordes with intent to make any sacrament, or any other thing.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     S. Paul spake these wordes of a Sacrament, made by God in the wildernes.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     Two diuerse natures in those words are named, which can not be one substance. But this is my body nameth one substance.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     One substance is demonstrated, and another named. Moses might haue said truely, shewing the rock to the people. This is Christe, or els S. Paul could not haue said truly, the rock was Christ.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     It was not anie one certaine rocke, whereof S.

Paul spake, for ye water flowed out of two Rocks. Either of which did signifie Christ, and they both are onely one Rocke in meaning, and in substance figured: therefore Saint Paul meant onely of the spirituall Rocke, which is Christ.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Manna, which was the spirituall meat they did eate, rayned euerie day, yet was it but one Christ in signification: therefore S. Paul meant onely of the spiritual Manna, which is Christ, and not of the corporall Manna which was a sacrament of Christ: if this reason hold not of the spirituall meate, howe can it holde of the spiritual drinke?
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     Christ gaue his disciples (as S. Augustine saith) the figure of his bodie and bloud.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     He did so: but he gaue such a figure, as is also the substance of his bodie, as himselfe being a figure of his fathers substance, is also the selfesame substance with his father.

                     Augustine in this place, and in many other maketh this difference betweene the sacrament of the old Testament, and of the new, yt theirs were of Christ to

Speaking of the bodie of Christ which was sacrificed once for all, in which wee are after a mysticall manner included and are also partakers thereof, after a mysticall manner, and so were all that euer pleased GOD: not after a corporall manner, such as the Papistes imagine: wherefore Augustine saith vpon the same Psalme, alluding to the celebration of the Sacrament,

Behold Augustine teacheth howe to receiue Christ truely, and not as he saith else-where, Sacramento tenus, as farre as the sacrament, or outward signe onely.

                     The names of bodie and bloud do vsually signifie a visible, corruptible &amp; mortal nature, which Augustine knowing, was a fraide lest children would think that Christ had walked on the earth, none otherwise then in the shape of breade: for that respect, hee alwayes teacheth that the bodie of Christ in the sacrament, is the signe and figure of Christs visible bodie.

                     Augustine feared no such matter de Trin. lib. 3. cap. 10. but onely by way of a similitude sheweth, that if children should neuer learne more of Christ, then that the Sacrament shoulde be shewed them and tolde them, that it is the bodie of Christ, and also if they should neuer see the shape of bread but onely in the celebration of the sacrament, they woulde imagine, that Christ had appeared onely in that shape: but this is impossible, therfore

Augustine coulde not feare it. And seeing hee had no such feare, he had no such respect, as Sander dreameth, as well concerning his feare, as concerning his respect.

                     Tertullian proueth, that Christ had a true bodie, because the sacrament was a figure thereof: for a phā
                        tasme or a vaine thing, can haue no figure. Wherefore Sander, and not Master Iewell, reasoneth like a Marcionite, confounding the figure with the thing figured.

                     Tertullian speaking most literally of bread, as it was an olde figure of Christes body, whereof in Ieremie it was saide, Let vs put the wood of the crosse into his bread, to wit vppon his bodie, saith: Christ then fulfilling the old figures, made bread his bodie: if he did so, it could not tarie bread any longer.

                     This place of Tertullian is shamefully mangled both in wordes and sense. Tertullian asketh. But why did he call breade his body, and not rather a pepon which Marcion accounted in steed of an hart, not vnderstanding, that this was an auncient figure of the bodie of Christ, saying by Ieremie: Against me haue they thought a thought, saying: Come, let vs cast wood on his breade, that is, the crosse on his bodie. Therefore the lightener of antiquities, sufficiently declared what he would haue breade then to haue signified, when he calleth bread his body. These words declare, wherefore Christ did appoint bread to signifie his bodie, in his supper: namely because it had bene an ancient figure of his body, in somuch that it was called bread. But he made bread his body, therefore it is not his body still. I aunswere, Tertullian sheweth how hee made it his body, when he expoundeth it by the name of the figure of his body. Baptisme being made regeneration, is still a washing with water. The rocke when it was made Christ, remained still a rocke. &amp;c.

                     Augustine saith not, that the body of Christ is our corporall meat, but that which answereth in proportion to Manna, as a corporal meat, namely bread and

                     But Tract. 11. he saith, Quid est Manna? what it Manna? I am, saith Christ, the liuing breade that came downe from heauen.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     It followeth immediately, Manna accipiunt fideles, the faithfull receiue Manna: therefore hee meaneth not Manna in this place for the corporall meate, but for the bodye of Christe, whiche is spirituall meate.

                     But he sayeth further: It is knowen what God had rained from heauen. And knowe not the Catechumeni what Christians take? Let them blush because they knowe not. Let them passe ouer by the redde sea. Let them eate Manna, that euen as they haue beleeued in the name of Iesus, so Iesus may commit him selfe to them. Therefore, Iesus is eaten bodily of vs after baptisme.

                     I denye the argument, except Manna be Iesus bodily. If Manna be spiritually taken, then Iesus is eaten in the Sacrament as he was in Manna, which Sander confesseth to be onely spiritually.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     But Catechumeni might so eate Christ, that is spiritually.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     They might not eate Christ in the Sacrament, before they were baptized, and therfore they were ignorant of that mysterie.

                     Euery faithfull man is made partaker of the body and bloud of Christ in baptisme, whiles he findeth that vnitie which is signified by the Sacrament: Therefore, the faithfull eate Christes bodie otherwise then in the Sacrament.

                     They are not partakers really, but onely in the Sacrament of the supper, in which, if the body were not really present, hee that is baptized, shoulde not at all be partaker of the Sacrament of Christes supper, because hee is not partaker of bread and wine, but onely is made a member of that mysticall bodie, which in the Sacrament is signified.

                     Tertullian speaketh manifestly of the externall Sacraments, which haue the name of the things signified, as of ye signes of baptisme, impositiō of hāds. &amp;c.

                     Chrysostom will not suffer this euasion: who saith, to vnderstand carnally, is to vnderstand plainly, as the thinges be vttered, and to thinke vppon nothing else.

                     S. Augustine saith: The saying of Christ is a figure or manner of speach, commanding vs to be partakers of Christes passion.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     The speach is figuratiue, not in the substance to be eaten, but in the manner of eating: therfore when Christ had consecrated bread into his bodie, that speache was not figuratiue, because the maner of eating was determined vnder the formes of bread and wine.
                  
                  
                     Fulk.
                     Saint Augustine hath stopped that starting hole, expounding ye meaning of that figuratiue speach, not of eating Christ vnder the forme of bread, but of communicating with the passion of Christ, which is represented by the Sacrament, and is perfourmed without the Sacrament. So you faile, both in your substance and manner of eating.

                     Tertullian saith: The Capernaits thought his speach was harde, and intollerable, as though he had determined to giue them his flesh verily, and in deede to be eaten (with their mouthes) therein saith Tertullian stoode their error.

                     Not onely the worde verè, must needes shewe they thought the substance of his fleshe shoulde be eaten verily, but also the argument of Tertullian

doeth plainly proue it. For he answereth the obiection of them that denyed the resurrection of the fleshe, because of ye Angelike perfection, whereunto the children of the resurrection shalbe changed: shewing that the perfection shall not bee through vertue of the fleshe, but through the incorruption which the flesh shall put on. Vsing a similitude of the flesh of Christ, which of it self doeth profite nothing, but by vertue of the spirit, which maketh it able to giue life. Wherefore the error of the Capernaits was, in that they imagined the substance of Christes flesh should be eaten bodily, which Tertullian affirmed should be eaten spiritually, and by faith of his worde onely. As for the authoritie of Lyra which followeth, is not worth the contention.

                     Christ in S. Iohn speaking of spirituall eating faith, made no mention of any figure: But in his supper he added an outward Sacrament to the same spirituall eating, which the fathers oft call a figure.

Yea he calleth it a figure of the body &amp; bloud of Christ: De Sacram lib. 4 Cap. 5. For it can be no figure of Christ before consecration. Touching Damascen, and Rabanus Maurus, I will not striue, because they are both later wnters then 600. yeres, although the later be cleare against this peece of Popery, the other not clearly for it.

                     The Sacrament (saith Augustine) is receiued from the Lords table: Of some vnto life, of some vnto destruction: The thing it self whereof it is a Sacrament (yt is the body of Christ) is receiued of euery man to life, &amp; of no man vnto destructiō, whosoeuer be partakers of it.

                     Sander.
                     The thing of the Sacrament, is not the body of Christ sitting in heauen, but the company of Saints, and the vnitie of the bodie and bloud of Christ, not his natural bodie, but his mysticall bodie the church. Therfore,

he saith not simply: The Sacrament, but the Sacrament of this thing, that is to say, of the body and bloud of Christ, which fiue words, M. Iewel hath left out.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     These fiue words help you as much as fiue egges, whereof foure be rotten. For Augustine by them vnderstandeth the flesh &amp; bloud, which Christ promised to giue, which if it be not the same bodie which sitteth in heauen, that bodie which sitteth in heauen is not giuen (by his iudgement) in the Sacrament. For thus he writeth vpon these words of Christ, He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, hath life euerlasting: Therefore he hath not this life, which eateth not this bread nor drinketh this bloud. For temporall life men may haue without it, but eternall they cannot haue at all. Therefore, he that eateth not his flesh, nor drinketh his bloud, hath not life in himselfe: and he that eateth his flesh &amp; drinketh his bloud, hath life eternall. And that he saith, euerlasting life, answereth to both: it is not so in this meate which we take for sustentation of the life of this bodie: for he which taketh it not, shall not liue: and yet he shall not liue which shall take it. For it may be, that by olde age or sickenesse, or some chance, many which shal take it, may die: but in-this meat &amp; drink, that is, in ye bodie and bloud of our Lorde, it is not so, for both he which taketh it not, hath not life: &amp; he which taketh it, hath life, &amp; yt verily eternal. Therefore he will haue this meat &amp; drink vnderstood to be ye fellowship of his body &amp; his members, which is ye holy church in his saints, and faithful ones predestinated &amp; called, &amp; iustified, &amp; glorified. Wherof ye first is alreadie done, yt is predestination, ye second &amp; third is both done &amp; is a doing, &amp; shalbe done, ye is, calling &amp; iustification: but ye fourth is now in hope, &amp; shalbe in deede, yt is glorification. The Sacrament of this thing, yt is, of ye vnitie of ye body &amp; bloud of Christ, in some places daily, in some places by certeine distance of dayes, is prepared in ye Lords table, to some vnto life, to some vnto destruction. But the thing it self, wherof also it is a Sacrament, is to euery man vnto life, to no man vnto destruction, whosoeuer shalbe partaker of it.
                     
                     
                        
You haue therefore gained thus much by your cauilling: that neither the flesh and bloud of Christ, promised in the sixt of Iohn, nor the thing of the Sacrament is the bodie of Christ which sitteth in heauen, but the participation of his mysticall bodie, and the fellowship or communion of his bodie, and the members therof, which is the assurance of eternall life. But where you saye, the Sacrament is that naturall body of Christ which sitteth in heauen, you saye beside your booke: for neither Augustine, nor any ancient father did euer say, that the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ was the body of Christ, otherwise then after a certeine manner of speaking, as Augustine saith.

                     I denie the argument. The Baker prepareth not the Sacrament, although he prepare some parte of ye earthly matter that is required vnto it, more then the sexton prepareth the sacrament of baptisme, by powring of water into the font.

not of his omnipotencie or diuine power, but of the absence of his humanitie by his ascension, and that the thing which he promiseth to be eaten, is not his naturall flesh to be bitten in their mouthes, but his grace to be receiued by faith in their hearts.

                     And I haue confuted your babling of Eagles in the same place.

                     Saint Hierome saith, Let vs goe vp with the Lorde (into heauen) into that great parlour, and receiue of him aboue, the cuppe of the newe testament.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     He saith not into heauen, but into the great parlour, which is the kingdome of the Church.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     But by the greate parlour, into which Christ is ascended, he meaneth heauen, where the kingdome of the Church is, and not the earth, where the Church is a stranger: the worde heauen is added in Master Iewel for explication, and not as parte of Ieromes wordes.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Chrysostome interpreteth, the parlour for the Church, in Matth. Hom. 38.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Chrysostome was no interpreter of Ierome. In allegories, euery man hath his owne inuention.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Christ giueth his bodie and bloude, hee is the feastmaker and the feast, he gaue that Moses coulde not giue.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     All is perfourmed in the great parlour, which is heauen. Wee must receiue of him aboue the cuppe of the new testament.

                     Cyrillus saith: Our Sacrament auoucheth not the eating of a man, leauing the mindes of the faithfull in vngodly manner to grosse or fleshly cogitations.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Cyrillus against Nestorius, denyeth the Sacrament to be the eating of a bare man, not assumpted into God. I haue spoken more, lib. 2. Cap. 25.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Cyrillus denieth the Sacrament to be 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         the eating of a man, and not onely the eating of

such a man, as Nestorius blasphemed Christ to be, See lib. 2. Cap. 25.

                     Cyril saith, that Christ setteth before vs the assumpted flesh of the sonne man.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Yea, but not in the Sacrament only, but as it was eaten of the fathers. Ad Theod. de rect. fide.
                     
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     He saith moreouer, the worde is not able to be eaten. What, M. Iewel? not by faith? yes verily, but not by mouth, but according to the dispēsatiō of ye vniō.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     God the word is not able to be eaten by faith, but in respect of the dispensatiue vnion. Cyril speaketh not of eating by mouth: for the properties of both natures remaine to be seen of vs by innumerable reasons, as it followeth immediatly. Graunt eating of his fleshe by mouth, and the propertie of the humane nature is cleane ouerthrowen. Your charging of master Iewel with the blasphemies of Nestorius deserueth none aunswere.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     The olde fathers, Chrysostome, Augustine, Leo, acknowledge Gods omnipotencie in baptisme, yet is not Christ really there. Therfore it was vaine labour to alleage his omnipotencie for the reall presence.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Baptisme hath no promise to be the flesh of Christ, therfore you haue lost your labour.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Baptisme hath promise to wash vs in ye bloud of Christ, to incorporate vs into Christ, to make vs partakers of his death, buriall, &amp; resurrection, Rom. 6. and yet no reall presence required, no, not of the holy ghost, otherwise than by effectuall grace, working our regeneration and newe birth. Yea, Christ doth wash vs in baptisme. Ep. 5.
                  
               
               
                  CAP. VIII.

                     Whether the Catholikes or Sacramentaries expound more vnproperly or inconueniently, ye wordes belonging to Christes supper.
                  
                  
                     Harding.
                     Because these places report, that Christ gaue at his supper his verie bodie, the fathers saye, it is really

in the Sacrament.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     A thing is taken to make proofe, which is doubtfll, and the antecedent is vnproued.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Said not Christ, take, eate, this is my bodie?
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     This prooueth not, that he gaue it in your sense. But where do the fathers say, it is really present in the Sacrament?
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     The fathers call the Sacrament a figure, a token, a signe, an image, &amp;c. Therefore Christes wordes may be taken with a metaphor, trope, or figure.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     It standeth wel togither to be a signe &amp; the trueth: As Christ is the image of God, &amp; yet God also.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     It is impossible to be a signe &amp; the thing signified. Neither is Christ God the Father, of whome hee is the image, although he be God.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     Euen Duns sawe, that following the bare letter, we must needs say, yt the bread it self is Christs bodie.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     The place is not quoted, therfore it is doubtful: for no man beleeueth you.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Looke in the fourth booke vpon the sentences. The same affirmeth O
                           •
                        kam, Quodlibet 4. quest. 30. Contrariū illius non habetur ex canone Bibliae. &amp;c. The contrary of that opinion, that bread should remaine, is not had out of the canon of the Bible, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     So the wordes stand, This (BREAD) is my body. Sander. where stand they so? in your gospel, but not in ours.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     A foolish cauill the word, bread, is added for explicatiō, &amp; by parenthesis shewed not to be of ye text.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     They say (this) meant not bread, but one certeine thing in generall.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     I haue shewed how it is taken, lib. 4. Ca. 4. 5. &amp; 6. Neither doth it signifie in generall, but that which is conteined vnder the forme of bread.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Who could tell, that you woulde renounce indiuidium vagum? and what is conteined but bread, before ye words of consecration be all spoken? Iewel. Est, they expounde, erit, it shalbe. Sander. you delight in falshod. Christ chose this word est, because it signifieth

a most present being of a thing: for God worketh in a moment.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Then the wordes make not the bodie of Christ, as all other Papistes saye. For the wordes cannot be vttered in a moment.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     
                        Erit, they expounde the substance of this vncerteine generall, one thing that shal be changed.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     These interpretations be false.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     They be the interpretations of all Papists except Sander, who also sayth, That which was bread before he spake, was his bodie at the ende of his speache. But what was it in the meane time, while he was in speaking, and saide, est it is?
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     It is giuen, they expounde, it shalbe giuen.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     We expound it of ye present vnblody sacrifice.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Harding, against whom master Iewel writeth, expoundeth it of the passion. Neither can it be both, as you say, but is in deede meant of the passion onely, but yet figuratiuely: seeing Christ said of his bloud which is shed, which cannot be vnderstood of your vnbloudie sacrifice, nor of ye bloudy sacrifice of Christ, wtout a figure.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     Do ye this, ye expound, sacrifice ye this.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Nay sir, we controll your false translation: for Hoc facite is make this my bodie. Of the making of the sacrificed substance, I haue spoken. li. 4. Cap. 13.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Sander controlleth the greatest Papistes that euer were before him, in his newfound translation.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     This bread, they expound, this yt was bread.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     You should name the place.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     A weake answere: the place is 1. Cor. 11.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     These verbs: He tooke, he blessed, he brake, he gaue, stande togither and rule one case.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     They stand together in order of writing, but not in order of doing.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     They rule a case, according to the order of writing, and not after the order of doing.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     If the words of consecration were spoken before the breaking, what wonder ye, if the thing yt was taken, being changed, we change ye construction of verbes?
                  
                  
                     
                     Fulke.
                     If the holy ghost haue set it downe otherwise, you shall haue much to doe to prooue it: if any thing be chaunged, you must giue vs another accusatiue case, then panem, and not chaunge the construction of verbes.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     He tooke bread, he blessed it away.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     He changed it into a better thing.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     By blessing? or by saying, This is my bodie?
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     God blesse me from such a man, who scoffeth at the holy mysteries.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Nay, he derideth your bald interpretations.

                     He brake the Accidents.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     That is true.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Accidents cannot be broken, except the substance whereof they be accidents, be broken.

                     He gaue his bodie.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     We beleeue it to be a meeter gift, then to giue common bread.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Who saith he gaue common bread?

                     Vpon these fewe words of Christ, thus manie figures and moe, they haue imagined.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     They be not all the words of Christ, but some are the words of the Euangelists. The words of Christ are all proper, but you haue many moe figures and absurdities.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     They be all the words of God, and if ye words of Christ be all proper, what neede so vnproper expositions of them? But now let vs heare no lesse thē 41. figures and absurdities, maintained by Protestants.

                     First, you ioyne together, this bread.

                     Sacraments be no shadows: Neither did Moses giue Manna, but God for ought that I knowe. And it is most conuenient, that the signes of the new testament, should be lesse glorious then of the old, because the doctrine is more cleare.

                     We will haue no more sacrifices, but the onely and once offered sacrifice of Christes death for our redemption. The repetition of sacrifice, sheweth an imperfection in it, and not a betternes. Saint Paul compareth Christes table with the altar &amp; table of diuels, not in sacrifice, but in causing the partakers to communicate with their altars, &amp; tables, which sheweth what the communicating of Christes table is, and ouerthroweth your carnall presence.

                     The promise is made in scripture, to him that eateth and drinketh bread and wine according to Christs institution, although not for eating bread and drinking wine onely.

You may demaunde the like reason of Baptisme, why ye water is not the blood of Christ but a figure of it.

                     Saint Augustines words being set downe more at large, then Sander citeth them, who leaueth out the foremost part, let the reader iudge, whether he meane of a manner of speach which is figuratiue and tropicall, or of a manner of being which is significatiue. Ep. 23. Bonifacio, Nempe saepè ita loquimur &amp;c. Verily, oftentimes wee SPEAKE so, that wee SAIE Easter drawing neere, to morowe or the next day is the passion of our Lorde, whereas he hath suffered so many yeeres past, and that passion was promised but once in all. Verily, on the sonday it selfe, we SAIE this day our Lorde arose againe, notwithstanding there are so many yeres since he arose. Why, is no man so foolish to reproue vs so SPEAKING as if wee had lyed? but because wee CALL these dayes according to the similitude of the dayes, in which those thinges were done, that it is SAIDE, the day it selfe, which is not the day it selfe, but in reuolution of time like it: that it is SAIDE to be done on yt daye, because of the celebration of the sacrament (or mysterie) which was not done that day, but long before. Was not Christ once offered in himselfe, and yet in a sacrament? not onely at euerie solemnitie of Easter, but euerie day he is offered for the people. Neither surely doth he lie, who being demanded, shall answere, that he is offered. For if the sacraments had not a certayne likenes of those thinges, whereof they are sacraments, they were not at all sacramentes.

Out of this likenes also, for the most part they take their names. Therefore as after a certaine maner ye sacrament of the body of Christ is the bodie of Christ, the sacrament of the bloode of Christ is the bloode of Christ so the sacrament of faith is faith. The whole discourse being of phrases and manners of speech, that are figuratiue, and this example of the Lordes supper being brought as one of them: iudge whether S. Augustine

Therfore as the heauenly bread, which is the flesh of Christ, (yt is, saith the glosse, the heauenly sacrament which truely representeth the flesh of Christ) after his maner, is called the bodie of Christ (the sense is, saith the glosse, it is called, that is, it fignifieth the bodie of Christ) whereas indeed it is the sacrament of the body of Christ, namely of that body which being visible; which being palpable was put on the crosse, and the verie immolation of his flesh which is done by the handes of the priest, is called the passion, death, crucifying of Christ, not in the trueth of the thing, but in a signifying mysterie: so the sacrament of faith, which is vnderstod to be baptisme, is faith.

                     You haue Englished the wordes very spightfully, you haue added Rent, of your own head. Atteri doth signifie to be broken in peeces, or to bee wasted, which may be done without grinding.

                     What great spight is in Rent, more then in Broken? and why should alteri signifie to be broken, whē we had the word broken before? and what honestie is it for you to say, ye body of Christ may be wasted wt the teeth? Finally, when you haue dentibus halteri.

                     Chrysostome speaketh figuratiuely, except you will say it is a proper speech, that Christ is seene in the Sacrament.

                     The ancient fathers, neuer made the forme or accidents of breade, but bread it selfe, to be the signe, or one part of the sacrament, representing ye bodie of Christ, and the thing signified, they made like to the godheade, whereby they vnderstoode not the naturall bodie of Christ, but the effect of his death.

                     S. Hierome shewing two wayes of vnderstanding Christs flesh, one spirituall (as it is verily meate) an other as it was crucified, declareth the manner of eating it onely, to differ from the manner of it being crucified, the substance being all one.

                     He can meane neither of both, seeing he distinguisheth that diuine and spirituall flesh, which is meat in deede vnto eternall life, from that flesh which was crucified, which if it were meate in the same sense, that it was crucified, that is in the naturall substance: S. Hieroms distinction should not be of that flesh which &amp;c. and that flesh which &amp;c. but of ye effects and affects of ye same flesh. Wherefore when he saith, the flesh of Christ is two waies to be vnderstanded, he meaneth of this word, The flesh of Christ, and not of the diuerse manners of presence therof in the sacrament, and on the crosse.

                     Master Harding knoweth, that Chrysostome speaketh generally of all other mysteries, for it followeth: Euen so in baptisme, the water is a thing sensible, the regeneration is a thing spirituall: wherefore, if M. Harding will force his reall presence in the one Sacrament, hee must likewise force the same in the other.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     D. Harding brought that place onely to shewe, that the bodie of Christ is not visibly present.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     The place prooueth, that the body of Christ is none otherwise present, then regeneration in baptisme.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     In baptisme, the grace of regeneration which is giuen, is conteined and giuen, when the worde commeth to the water.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     The water is no subiect, for the grace of God, &amp; yet Chrysost, saith, not ye grace, but regeneratiō it self.

Nothing is borne againe, but the partie baptized, therefore regeneration is not conteined in the element or action of baptisme.

                     The difference betweene baptisme and our Lords supper.
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     Forasmuch as these two Sacraments be both of like force: I wil touch, what the fathers think of gods working in baptisme. The fathers in the Councell of Nice, bid vs thinke, that the water is full of heauenly fire &amp;c. Basil, the kingdome of heauen is set open, Chrysostome, God himself in baptisme by his inuisible power, holdeth thy head. Ambrose, In the water is the grace of Christ, and the presence of the Trinitie. Bernard, Let vs be washed in his bloud. &amp;c. By force of which wordes M. Hard. may proue, yt the power of God, the heauenly fire, ye grace &amp; bloud of Christ, is really present in baptisme.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Nothing is really present that is affirmed of a Sacrament, except it be signified present, in the wordes instituted by Christ, which make the Sacrament, or of necessitie be inferred vpon them.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Neither is all that really present, which is affirmed of a Sacrament, that is signified present, in the words instituted by Christ, which make the Sacrament: As Christ saide, This is my bodie, so hee sayde, This cuppe is the newe Testament in my bloud: yet it followeth not, that the newe Testament is really present in the cuppe, no nor in the bloud of Christ, which he shedd for vs, but is confirmed by it, and signified by the other.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Baptisme &amp; the Eucharist hath many differences the one from the other.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     If they had no differences, they should be all one, yet haue they not so many as you make. But in the matter in question, they haue like force, to vnite vs to Christ, and assure vs of eternall life, which none can haue but they that eate the flesh and drinke the bloude

of Christ: or else, what becōmeth of them that are baptized, and not admitted to the communion?

                     We behold (saith the Councel of Nice) the lambe of God

                         is not found in the Greek, nor in Tunstall, but deuised by M. Harding.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     It is founde in the actes of the Councell, that are not all printed, but they are extant in diuerse Libraries.

                     You name none, where we should find them, to trye your trueth and the antiquitie of those coppies.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     In many Latine printed bookes, it is translated s

                     The question is not what some Latine coppies haue, but what is the originall Greeke.
                  
                  
                     Iewel.

                        , which signifieth to be set or placed, needes sounde a reall presence?
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Can you haue a capon set and placed vppon your table, which is not really present?
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     A fit comparison, betweene a capon and the lambe of God.
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     Christ dwelleth in our heart by faith, and yet not really.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     The lambe of God is not saide to be on the holy table, by faith, but to be set or laide there.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     How can the Councell saye, We behold it set there, but by faith?
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     S. Hierom saith: as often as we enter into the sepulchre, we see our Sauiour lying in his shroode, yet he lay not there really.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     But he lay there once really. Howe coulde the Councell say, wee beholde the lambe of God placed vpon the holy table, which neither nowe, nor at any

time was really there?
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     By faith: as we behold him in his ministers, and in baptisme, washing our sinnes with his bloude, where he is not really present, nor euer was, after that manner.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     In the Councel of Chalcedon, it is demanded, in what scripture lye these two natures of Christ, it is the same worde 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , yet they lye not really in the scriptures.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     The heretike asked for very materiall and reall wordes.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     If the natures may be said figuratiuely to lye, where the wordes are found: why may not the lamb of God be saide to lye, where the bread and wine, which are signes of him, do lye?
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     That word signifieth a naturall situation of place, &amp; order of parts: such as D. Harding in the next article, saith Christs bodie hath not in the sacrament.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     It hath such situation as the forme of bread requireth.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Then the forme of bread is situated, &amp; not the bodie of Christ, or the lambe of God, which you might as well vrge to be taken in his proper sense, for a natural lambe, as 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         to be laide.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     The Councell is plaine, that we consider not basely the bread and wine that is set before vs.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     He considereth them basely, who saith, they remaine still in earthly substance.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     He considereth them not at all, who saith, they are no part of the Sacrament.
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     It is said, lift vp your heartes: so that there is nothing in the action to be considered, but only Christ.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     I haue spoken of this matter at large, lib. 2. Cap. 24. of Eagles, Cap. 27.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     And there I haue briefely answered.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     S. Ambrose saith: it is better seene, that is not seene.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Therfore, the bodie of Christ is better sene, then bread and wine.
                  
                  
                     
                     Fulke.
                     Who doubteth of that?
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     For the same cause S. Augustine saith: In Sacraments we must consider not what they be, but what they represent. For they are tokens of things, being one thing, and signifying another.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     As they be tokens, they be one thing, &amp; signifie another: and therefore the substance of Christes bodie, is not his death or passion, or the vnitie of his Church, which thing vnder the forme of bread it doeth signifie, but it is another manner of thing, to wit, a bodie immortal, impassible, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     If S. Augustine had beleeued ye Sacrament to be the immortall bodie of Christ, he would neuer haue said, In Sacraments, we must not consider what they be, but alway what they signifie, Con. Max. lib. 3. Cap 22.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     Touching our beholding of Christ in ye Sacrament. S. Aug. saith: It worketh such motions in vs, as if we saw our Lord himself present vpon the crosse.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     S. Aug. speaketh of the solemnitie of Easter, which was kept by preaching &amp; shewing some image of Christ, &amp; by creeping to the crosse.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Hee speaketh generally of signes; as for images and creeping to the crosse, is a moste impudent lye.
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     This is that Eusebius writeth, that the bodie might be worshipped by a mysterie, &amp; that euerlasting sacrifice should liue in remembrance, and be present in grace for euer: in this spirituall sort, &amp; not fleshly, Christ is laide present vpon the altar.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     You leaue out that he saith, the oblation of the redemption should be euerlasting, by which wordes Eusebius declareth, that the Sacrament is such a mysterie, as offereth vs that continuall redemption, which Christ hath purchased for vs.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Eusebius declareth no such matter, but a memoriall of the euerlasting and one onely sacrifice, quod semel offerebatur in pretium, which was but once offered for a price or redemption.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     The same Eusebius saith: the inuisible preist

turneth the visible creatures with his worde, into the substance of his body and bloud.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     So he saith, that man is by the workmanship of the heauenly mercy made the body of Christ in baptisme: wherefore he speaketh not of Popish transubstantiation, but of a spirituall mutation, such as is in baptisme.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     S. Augustine saith: you are vpon the table, you are in the cup. As the people is laid vpon the table, so and none otherwise, the councell of Nice saieth, the lambe of God is laid vpon the table.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     What, Master Iewell? is the table turned into vs, as Eusebius saith, the visible creatures are turned, &amp;c?
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Euen such a conuersion is of the bread into his body, as is of the table and cuppe into vs, namely spirituall. For without some kinde of conuersion, it were not possible, that wee should be on the table, and in the cuppe.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Wee should not bee there, if our head Iesus Christ were not vnder the forme of bread &amp; wine, where in we are signified: but of this more, lib. 5. Cap 5.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     As we are there, so is our head Iesus Christ, and none otherwise.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     The Greeke worde 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , verily, by D. Hardings iudgment soundeth no lesse then really: But these two wordes, truely and fleshly, haue sundry meanings and in the sense that Christ spake vnto the Iewes, the one doth vtterly exclude the other.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     If you take fleshly, for the substance of flesh, is is all one in speaking, to say truely and fleshly: but as concerning the corruptible qualities of flesh, it is not all one.

                     The spirituall sense of eating Christes flesh truely, in which he spake to the Iewes, doth vtterly exclude the Popish sense of eating the substance of his flesh.
                  
                  
                     Iewell.
                     He that eateth most spiritually, eateth most truely: as Christ is the true vine, the true Manna: and we are verily one breade, and the Apostles verily the heauens.

And these are the Paschall feastes, wherein verily the lambe is slaine.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     In comparison of bodily eating alone, spirituall eating is more true, and of a better sort: but a thing both eaten in body and spirit, is farre more truely eaten both waies, then by one way alone.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Master Iewel hath well prooued, that ye word Truly, may wel exclude fleshly, bodily, really. As for the bodily eating, is the matter in question, therefore, not to be brought in argument.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     When the name of any thing affirmed of Christe, apperteineth to the true nature of his manhod, which he hath assumpted, it is to be verified of him not onely by a metaphore but in very deede, therfore he is man in deede, offred in deede, killed in deede, buried in deede, eaten in deede.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     For a man to bee eaten in the shape of bread, apperteineth not to ye true nature of his manhood, which he hath assumpted, therefore it is not to bee verified of him, but onely by a metaphor, or figuratiue speech, by your owne rule.
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     S. Augustine vtterly remoueth the naturall office of the body: what preparest thou thy teeth? beleue, and thou hast eaten. Beleeuing in him, is the eating of the bread of life.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     S. Augustine spake these wordes, to the faithlesse Iewes of Capernaum: and not to Catholikes.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     If Iewes become faithfull, what differ they from Catholikes? why should they haue another maner of eating Christ, then other Catholikes?
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     S. Augustine confesseth vs to receiue Christ by mouth also, Hominem Iesum Christum, &amp;c. We doe receiue with a faithfull heart and mouth, the man Iesus Christ, giuing his flesh vnto vs to be eaten, and his bloud to be drunke, although it may seeme more horrible, to eate mans flesh then to kil it, and to drinke mans bloud, then to shedde it. Therefore his meaning is not to remoue vtterly the naturall office of the body, as Master Iewel most impudently saith.
                  
                  
                     
                     Fulk.
                     He remoueth not the natural office of the body from eating the Sacrament, but from eating the natural body of Christ. And most horrible is the impudence of Master Sander, which dissembleth that S. Augustine in the place by him cited, speaketh of figuratiue sayings contra aduers. leg. &amp; proph. lib. 2. Cap. 9. Immediatly before the words by him rehearsed, comparing our eating of Christes fleshe, with Christ beeing one flesh with his Church, and immediatly after the wordes aforesaied concluding that figuratiue sayinges must not bee contemned. 
                           Sicut duos, &amp;c. Euen as wee doe knowe Christ and his Church, to be two in one flesh, without any obscenity against the will of these men: Euen as we receiue with faithfull hart and mouth, the mediator of God and man, the man Iesus Christ, &amp;c. Atque in omnibus. And in all the holy scriptures, if any thing which is spoken or done figuratiuely, bee expounded according to the rule of sound faith, of any matters or wordes, which are conteined in the holy scriptures, let not that exposition bee taken contemptuously.
                     
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Said he not, for the honour of so great a Sacrament, it pleased the holy ghost, that our Lordes body should enter into the mouth of a Christian before other meates, and yet is the office of the body remoued, and that vtterly remoued?
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Said he not before, it was a figuratiue speach, to eate the flesh of Christ, and to drinke his bloud? and is it then a great merueile, if the Sacrament be called by the name of ye thing whereof it is a Sacrament? For the question is not in that Ep. 118. Whether the bodye of Christ should be preferred before other things, but whether ye Sacramēt shuld be receiued fasting, or after meat.
                     The rest of your chat, concerning the councell of 8. Cardinals, compared with the conference Wittenberg, I passe ouer, as conteining no argument touching the matters in question.

                     Foure speciall meanes there be, by euery of which, Christes body dwelleth in our bodies, not by imagination, but really, substantially, naturally, fleshly, and in deede.

                     The assertion is of the phrase, or manner o speaking, against which you cauil

                     Christes body by his natiuity, whereby hee embraceth vs, dwelleth in our bodies really, substantially, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     If you had said by his incarnation, he dwelleth naturaly in vs, or we in him, that saying might haue a true sense: but to say that his body dwelleth in our bodies, not onely naturally, but also really, &amp;c. it seemeth to me very hard.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     His natiuity importeth his incarnation. And what meane you by, naturally, but in the trueth and real substance of his body, after a naturall manner?
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     Christ tooke not the common general substance of all mankind, but onely the whole particular nature of man.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     Sander fighteth against his owne shadowe, for heere is no man that saith against him: and so through the whole Chapiter. Wheras Master Iewel defendeth the phrase of speaking, Christes body dwelleth really, &amp;c. in our bodies, which in som sense is true: Sander answereth it is not true in euery sense. And he dwelleth not onely by his birth, wheras Master Iewel affirmeth three other waies by which Christ may be said so to dwell in vs.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     One thing I must put you in mind of. You defend that Christes naturall body may not be in many places at once, but you say now, that his body by his natiuity, dwelleth really, &amp;c. in our bodies, which dwel in mani places, therfore you are against your own doctrin.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     So long as there be no greater contrarietie, in Master Iewels doctrine, it is safe inough. This is miserable sophistry, more worthy to be hissed at among boys,

I thinke there is no cobler in Cambridge or Oxforde, but he could winde himselfe out of this fallacia. To dwell in all men by participation of common nature, is one thing, and one whole bodie, to be whole in tenne thousand places, is another thing.

                     Fulke.
                     The question should be whether this manner of speach in some sense may not be iustified.

                     If he had saide, the virgine Mary conceiued Christ by faith in her heart more happily, then carnally in her wombe: In affirming the one, he had not denied ye other, and yet he had said nothing but the trueth. Did not whole Christ dwell in the godly by faith, before his incarnation? Did they not eate and drinke the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ by faith, before his bodie was conceiued in the virgins wombe? If these sayings be true, the other phrase according to this sense may be defended.

                     If the worde, really, may be taken in diuerse senses, what contradiction is there? when he saith, Christ dwelleth in vs really by faith: the word really, is made opposite to imaginatiuely, figuredly, or phantastically, and signifieth Christ in deede is communicated vnto vs by the effectes of his incarnation, death, passion, resurrection, &amp;c. Where he saith: Christ is not really and fleshly placed in our hearts by faith: the word (really) is opposite to faith, which is a substance of things to be hoped fo

                        , which are not actually present, &amp; signifieth that

the naturall substance of Christs flesh, lyeth not locally in the substance of our heartes. According to these two significations, what contradiction is there? but that you are disposed to cauil.

                     This saying may be iustified in the affirmatiue, as wel as that he dwelleth really in our bodies by ye Sacrament of his supper. The diuerse vnderstanding of ye word really, maketh al the controuersie in this matter: M. Iewel taketh it in one sense, M. Sander in another: Not ignorantly mistaking, but wilfully &amp; maliciously deprauing M.

                     By this Sacrament (saith Chrysostom) Christ reduceth vs, as it were into one lump with himself: and that not by faith only, but he maketh vs his own bodie in deede, Re ipsa, which is no other to say, then really.

                     This place would haue stand M. Harding in better steede, if Chrysostome had said: Christ mingleth his bodie with the Sacrament, and driueth himselfe &amp; it into one lumpe.

As for our wonderfull coniunction wt him, it is not that which is the figure, but the mingling into one lumpe, which are the words of Chrysostome.
                  
                  
                     Iewel.
                     It is a hot kind of speach, such as Chrysostom was much delighted with. It is a speach farre passing the common sense &amp; course of trueth.

                     It might likewise prooue, that S.

                     Against the Arrians, Hilarius reasoned thus, Christ is really ioined vnto ye father, as vnto vs, but Christ is ioyned to vs by nature, therefore Christ is ioyned to God the father by nature. That Christ is ioyned to vs by nature, he proueth it thus: We are ioyned to Christ by faith, that is by the nature of one faith, and that is to say, naturally.

                     S.

and where cleare vision is, there is no faith saith Sander. Not considering, that Christ did voluntarily, empty him selfe, of all such pretogatiues of his godheade, as might hinder him to haue experience of all our infirmities, except sinne. And therfore S. Luke testifieth yt Iesus incresed in wisedom, and stature, and fauour with God &amp; men. But where such cleare vision is, as Sand. imagineth, there is no increase of wisdome &amp; gods gifts. And concerning faith: read ye 22. Psal. which is a prophecie of Christ, professing his constant faith, in so much that he was therefore derided of the wicked, which saide, he trusted in God, let him deliuer him &amp;c. Yea the Apostle to ye Hebrewes proueth the humanitie of Christ, by this Psal. 16. (where the prophet speaketh in ye person of Christ) I wil put my trust in him, that is in God: yet Sander saith, he neuer had faith, but more then faith. As though a greater &amp; a more perfect faith were not faith.

                     A simple quarel, to make such outcries of the terme naturally, when Hilarie hath termes in all reasonable mens iudgements, equiualent, concluding that all Christians are one, not onely by wil, but also by nature, Because they are cloathed with one Christ, by the nature of one baptisme. And where I pray you, hath either Harding or you found yt Christs body is in y• sacrament naturally, according to M. Iewels challenge? wil you neuer leaue this beggerly sophistrie?

corporally, and carnally in vs by faith, by regeneration, and by baptisme: euen so and none otherwise, hee is in vs, by the sacrament of his bodie.

                     The aduerbe verily in this place doth signifie naturally, really, and substantially. For as the worde is made flesh really, so we take really the word being flesh in our Lords meate. The worde was not made flesh onely by our faith, but in trueth of his substance.

We eate Christ as truely, as he was made man, &amp; borne of ye Virgin Mary, but not in ye same manner: we eate him not sensibly, visibly, palpablie, in length, bredth, and thicknesse as hee was made fleshe,

but vnder a mysterie or sacrament of his flesh, which is communicated vnto vs after a spirituall manner. And where you say the worde was not made flesh, onely by our faith, therefore we take his flesh not by faith onely. Neither is the antecedent true, nor the conclusion right. For Christ was not made flesh onely by our faith, nor by our faith at all. For our faith was no meane of his incarnation. Where vpon I might as rightly conclude: The word was not made flesh by our faith at all: therefore we take not the worde being made flesh by faith at all.

Therefore he meaneth that Christs flesh is truely vnited to vs by vertue of his spirit, which is testified in the sacrament, and not that the sacrament receiued, is the onelie meane, but the seale of our faith, which apprehēdeth the working of Gods spirit in this merueilous coniunction aboue the reach of mans reason.

                     How can you auoid ye yoke, the dependance, the mutual respect that is betweene bodie &amp; bodily? if bodily be truely, then corpus with M. Iewel, is latine for trueth.

                     The yoke is auoided, when the aduerb signifieth only a similitude vnto that which is meant by the Nowne: as spiritualiter enforceth not the presence of a spirite, but after the similitude or maner of a spirite. So angelicè viuere, vento

As for corpus, although it be not Latine for trueth, yet to signifie trueth, sometime it is not harde to finde in the scripture. S. Paul saith, The Iewish feastes are vmbra futurorum, corpus autem Christi, the shadowe of things to come, but the bodie is of Christ: what is the sense of bodie here, but trueth? As for Sanders feare; least Christes naturall bodie might so be transformed into a trueth of faith or charitie, or bones without fleshe, or skinne without flesh or bones, is vaine and foolish: yea, spiteful and malicious: for, if bodie, and bodily, be somtimes taken for trueth, and truely, according to the circumstance of the place, it will not followe, that those wordes should always be so taken, where the text openly reclaimeth.

                     Otherwise there must needs follow this great inconuenience, that our bodie must be in like maner cor porally, naturally, and fleshly in Christs bodie.

                     Iewel.
                     That we be thus in Christ, requireth not any corporall being.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     That were a fine being, M. Iewel, that Christs bodie should be in vs corporally, yet the being shoulde not be corporall.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     This is a fine wit M. Sander, being demanded of an horsmill, to answere of a milhorse. M. Iewell would knowe, whether any corporall being is required, that we, I say we, should be in Christ corporally. You answere of Christes being in vs, because you cannot auoide the absurditie of our beeing in Christe corporally, after your corporall and carnall vnderstanding.

                     It requireth not any locall being.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     It is a locall being, in respect that the substance of Christ occupieth the same place, vnder the forme of bread, which the substance of bread did occupie before.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     That is a fine place for a man of perfect stature. But why answere you of Christes being in the Sacrament, when M. Iewel speaketh of our being in Christ corporally? I perceiue your infirmitie: you cannot heare on that side.

                     Christ fitting in heauen, is here in vs, not by a naturall, but by a spirituall meane of being.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     The being of Christ in vs by his spirite, is also natural, concerning the nature of his godhed, which is euery where.

                     Still you take chalke for cheese. Wee enquire of the beeing of his humanitie, whether it may be naturally sitting in heauen, and here with vs.

                     Saint Augustine sayth: After that Christ is ascended, he is in vs by his spirite. And S. Basil, and againe S. Augustine saith the like in diuerse places. And Christ spake in S. Paul, &amp;c.

                     Shall one trueth alwayes displace another with you. These be sowters arguments, Christ is God, therefore he is not man: he is in heauen, ergo he is not

                     Saint Augustine, by his ascension, and presence by his spirite, concludeth the absence of his humanitie from the earth. Ascendit in Coelum, &amp; non est hîc, he hath ascended into heauen, and he is not here, In Ioan. Tr. 50. This is no sowters argument, except Saint Augustine be a sowter, in fine Master Sanders deintie iudgement.

                     This coniunction is spirituall, &amp; therefore needeth not, neither the circumstance of place, nor corporall presence.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     The coniunction is spirituall, but the maner of working it, is brought to passe, by the corporall substance of Christ.

                     The corporal substance needeth not to come vnto vs, that a spirituall coniunction may be made betweene Christ and vs: the spirite of God, is the onely necessarie meane to make a spirituall coniunction.

                     The coniunction that is betweene Christ &amp; vs, neither doth mingle persons, nor vnite substances: but it doeth knit our affects togither, and ioyne our willes, saith S. Cyprian.

                     He denyeth the corporall manner of vniting of substances, namely of the substance of our bodies, with the substance of the bodie of Christ.

                     The coniunction because it is spiritual, true, full, and perfect, is expressed by this terme, corporall.
                  
                  
                     Sander.
                     As though, God, because he is spiritual, true, full and perfect, he might therefore be called corporall.

                     If all accidentall ioyning be remoued, only substantiall ioyning remaineth. A substantiall ioyning requireth the substances to be present that are ioyned together.

                     The substances that are ioyned together after a spirituall manner, neede no locall presence of the substances to be ioyned, whome the spirite of Christe can couple, though they be in place distant, with an inseparable vnion.

                     All the fathers that saye Christ dwelleth in vs corporally, speake generally of all the members of the Church, of which many haue not receiued the Sacrament, therefore it is not by the Sacrament onely.

This naturall participation, &amp; eating of the flesh of Christ, is not onely in the Eucharist.

                     That they are alike formed out of Christ in both the Sacraments, it ouerthroweth your corporall presence in the one only.

                     Although it were in him, yet is it to no purpose: for it is one thing to be made of the flesh of Christ, which may be meant of his mysticall flesh, another thing to partake his flesh naturally. We are made of his flesh by spirituall meanes.

                     What can it bee, to partake naturally

his flesh, if it be not to become flesh of his flesh, &amp; bone of his bones? you saye, we may be made of his flesh, by spirituall meanes: what may wee be made of the matter of his flesh? Chrysostome telleth you flesh and bones: yea, of his mysticall flesh. What, are we made mysticall flesh? then verily wee must bee made mysticall bones also. This is a mistie exposition of so cleare a matter.

                     The reason why certeine places of Scripture are interpreted, sometime of baptisme, sometime of Christes supper, is, because in the olde time, in manye countries, the Sacrament of Christes bodie, was giuen straight after baptisme.
                  
                  
                     Fulke.
                     A wise reason, why they shoulde make that common to both the Sacraments, which was proper to one. They were not ministred so neete in time, but they could discerne what was common, what was peculiar to either of them.

                     Master Harding is not yet able to find, that Christes bodie is either corporally receiued into our bodies, or corporally present in the Sacrament.

                     So would I shewe it at large out of Cyrillus, but that partely the booke is growne alreadie too great: partly, a marueilous number of places doe proue both Christes bodie to be corporally receiued into our bodies, and to bee corporally present in the Sacrament.

                     Bernard whome you haue often alleaged, writeth in ser. de sanct. Martyr. Euen to this day, the same flesh is exhibited to vs, which the Apostles had seene in his manhood, but yet spiritually forsouth, not carnally. For there is no cause why we should say, ye apparition, which was made to the fathers of the olde Testament, either that presence of his flesh, which was exhibited to the Apostles, to bee denied in these our daies. For to

them who faithfully consider the matter it shal be clere, yt neither of both lacketh. For the true substance of the fleshe it selfe is present, nowe also to vs no doubt verily, but that it is so in the Sacrament.

Howe was it verily meate and drinke, when he spake, if no man might eate and drinke it, before his supper?

How can this be verified in the present temps, so oftē repeted, except Christ did at that present time deliuer his fleshe and bloude to bee eaten of all that beleeued and offered the same to all that heard him? wherefore the doctrine of the Gospel, is agreable to that which master Iewel teacheth, and directlye contrarie to master Sanders doctrine, that Christ deliuered not his flesh and blood to be eaten &amp; dronken before his supper, but onely promised them at Capernaum.

                     You play mockeholiday. S. Hilarie saith not, That Christ is present in the sacrament carnally.

                     Neither the one, nor the other, euer saide, that Christ is in the sacrament naturally. Touching the naturall participation and vnion, it hath bene shewed how it may be without Christ being present, naturally, in the sacrament.
                  
                  
                     Iew.
                     But as in a sacrament, by his spirit &amp; by his grace.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     Here appeareth what stuffe you haue fedde the reader withall in your whole booke. For partly you denie a trueth, which is that Christ is not corporally present, against the expresse worde of God, and the fathers, as I haue shewed.
                  
                  
                     Fulk.
                     And yet neither the expresse word of God, nor any of the fathers, haue this sentence: Christ is corporally present in the sacrament, or any thing equiualent to it.
                  
                  
                     Sand.
                     Partly you prooue, that your heresie by an other trueth which rather establisheth then hindereth the reall presence. For Christ cannot be better present in spirit and grace, then if he be present in his flesh.
                  
                  
                     Fulk.
                     The presence of Christ by his spirit and grace, excludeth your heresie of presence corporally, and he is better present by spirit and grace, whereby he tarieth in vs for euer, then by your imagined presence of his body, in which you confesse him to tarie but a short time, no not in them that receiue the sacrament most worthilie.
                     Your conclusion being for ye most part, but a repetition of such cauils, slanders, and railings, as you haue vsed throughout the booke, deserueth no seuerall answere: partly because the greatest part of them are answered alreadie, and partly because both they and the rest, conteine nothing but generall accusations, without any speciall

argument to proue them.
                     As for that you make bost that you haue pr
