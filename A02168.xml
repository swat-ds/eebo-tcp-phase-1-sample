            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               Why angrie Scot, I visit thee for loue: then what
mooues thee to wroath?
            
            
               Bohan.
               The deele awhit reck I thy loue. For I knowe
too well, that true loue tooke her flight twentie winter sence to
heauen, whither till ay can, weele I wot, ay sal nere finde loue:
an thou lou'st me, leaue me to my selfe. But what were those
Puppits that hopt and skipt about me year whayle?

               Ober.
               I am.
            
            
               Bohan.
               The deele thou art, whay thou look'st not so big as
the king of Clubs, nor so sharpe as the king of Spades, nor so
faine as the king Adaymonds, be the masse ay take thee to bee
the king of false harts: therfore I rid thee away, or ayse so curry
your Kingdome, that yous be glad to runne to saue your life.
            
            
               Ober.
               Why stoycall Scot, do what thou dar'st to me, heare is
my brest strike.
            
            
               Boh.
               Thou wilt not threap me, this whiniard has gard many
better mē to lope thē thou: but how now? Gos sayds what wilt
not out? whay thou wich, thou deele, gads fute may whiniard.
            
            
               Ober.
               Why pull man: but what 
                     〈◊〉
                   twear out how then?
            
            
               Boh.
               This then, thou weart best begon first: for aylso lop
thy lyms, that thouse go with half a knaues carkasseto the deele
            
            
               Ober.
               Draw it out, now strike foole, canst thou not?
            
            
               Boh.
               Bread ay gad, what deele is in me, whay tell mee thou
skipiack what art thou?
            
            
               Ober.
               Nay first tell me what thou wast from thy birth, what
thou hast past hitherto, why thou dwellest in a Tombe, &amp; leauest
the world? and then I will release thee of these bonds, before
not.
            
            
               Boh.
               And not before, then needs must needs sal: I was borne
a gentleman of the best bloud in all Scotland, except the king,
when time brought me to age, and death tooke my parents, I
became a Courtier, where though ay list not praise my selfe, ay
engraued the memory of Boughon on the skin-coate of some of
them, and reueld with the proudest.
            
            
               Ober.
               But why liuing in such reputation, didst thou leaue to
be a Courtier?
            
            
               Boh.
               Because my pride was vanitie, my expence losse, my reward
faire words and large promises, &amp; my hopes spilt, for that
after many yeares seruice, one outran me, and what the deele
should I then do there. No no, flattering knaues that can cog
and prate fastest, speede best in the Court.
            
            
               
               Ober.
               To what life didst thou then betake thee?
            
            
               Boh.
               I then chang'd the Court for the countrey, and the wars
for a wife: but I found the craft of swaines more vile, then the
knauery of courtiers: the charge of children more heauie then
seruants, and wiues tongues worse then the warres it selfe: and
therefore I gaue ore that, &amp; went to the Citie to dwell, &amp; there
I kept a great house with smal cheer, but all was nere the neere.
            
            
               Ober.
               And why?
            
            
               Boh.
               because in seeking friends, I found table guests to eate
me, &amp; my meat, my wiues gossops to bewray the secrets of my
heart, kindred to betray the effect of my life, which when I noted,
the court ill, the country worse, and the citie worst of all, in
good time my wife died: ay wood she had died twentie winter
sooner by the masse, leauing my two sonnes to the world, and
shutting my selfe into this Tombe, where if I dye, I am sure I
am safe from wilde beasts, but whilest I liue, cannot be free frō
ill companie. Besides, now I am sure gif all my friends faile me,
I sall haue a graue of mine owne prouiding: this is all. Now
what art thou?
            
            
               Ober.
               
                  Oberon King of Fayries, that loues thee because thou
hatest the world, and to gratulate thee, I brought those Antiques
to shew thee some sport in daunsing, which thou haste
loued well.
            
            
               Bohan.
               Ha, ha, ha, thinkest thou those puppits can please
me? whay I haue two sonnes, that with one scottish gigge shall
breake the necke of thy Antiques.
            
            
               Ober.
               That would I faine see.
            
            
               Boha.
               Why thou shalt, howe boyes.
Enter Slipper and Nano.
Haud your clacks lads, trattle not for thy life, but gather vppe
your legges and daunce me forthwith a gigge worth the sight.
            
            
               Slip.
               Why I must talk on Idy fort, wherfore was my tongue
made.
            
            
               Boha.
               Prattle an thou darst ene word more, and ais dab this
whiniard in thy wembe.
            
            
               
               Ober.
               Be quiet Bohan, Ile strike him dumbe, and his brother
too, their talk shal not hinder our gyg, fall to it, dance I say mā.
            
            
               Boh.
               Dance Humer, dance, ay rid thee.
The two dance a gig deuised for the nonst.
Now get you to the wide world with more thē my father gaue
me, thats learning enough, both kindes, knauerie &amp; honestie:
and that I gaue you, spend at pleasure.
            
            
               Ober.
               Nay for their sport I will giue them this gift, to the
Dwarfe I giue a quicke witte, prettie of body, and awarrant his
preferment to a Princes seruice, where by his wisdome he shall
gaine more loue then cōmon. And to loggerhead your sonne,
I giue a wandering life, and promise he shall neuer lacke: and
auow that if in all distresses he call vpon me to helpe him: now
let them go.
            
            Exeunt with curtesies.
            
               Boh.
               Now King, if thou bee a King, I will shew thee whay I
hate the world by demonstration, in the yeare 1520. was in
Scotland, a king ouerruled with parasites, misled by lust, &amp; many
circumstances, too long to trattle on now, much like our
court of Scotland this day, that story haue I set down, gang with
me to the gallery, &amp; Ile shew thee the same in Action, by guid
fellowes of our country men, and then when thou seest that,
iudge if any wise man would not leaue the world if he could.
            
            
               Ober.
               That will I see, lead and ile follow thee.
            
            Exeunt.

                  But Dorithea, since I must depart,
                  And leaue thee from thy tender mothers charge.
                  Let me aduise my louely daughter first,
                  What best befits her in a forraine land,
                  Liue Doll, for many eyes shall looke on thee,

                  For she that steps to height of Maiestie,
                  Is euen the marke whereat the enemy aimes.
                  Thy vertues shall be construed to vice,
                  Thine affable discourse to abiect minde.
                  If coy, detracting tongues will call thee proud:
                  Be therefore warie in this slippery state,
                  Honour thy husband, loue him as thy life:
                  Make choyce of friends, as Eagles of their yoong▪
                  
                  Who sooth no vice, who flatter not for gaine:
                  But loue such friends as do the truth maintaine.
                  Thinke on these lessons when thou art alone,
                  And thou shalt liue in health when I am gone.

                  Yet feare and loue hath tyde thy readie tongue
                  From blabbing forth the passions of thy minde,
                  Lest fearefull silence haue in suttle lookes

                  That lodgeth here, and entred through mine eyes,
                  Yet how so ere I loue, I must be wise.
                  Now louely Countesse, what reward or grace,
                  May I imploy on you for this your zeale,

                  I count of Court my Lord, as wise men do,
                  Tis fit for those that knowes what longs thereto:
                  Each person to his place, the wise to Art,

                  If bewtie (as I know there's none in me)
                  Were sworne my loue, and I his life should be:
                  The farther from the Court I were remoued,
                  The more I thinke of heauen I were beloued.

                  Where gifts and vowes for stales are often set,
                  None, be she chaste as Vesta, but shall meete
                  A curious toong to charme her eares with sweet.

                  That they that little proue
                  Are mickle blest, from bitter sweets of loue:
                  And weele I wot, I heard a shepheard sing,
                  That like a Bee, Loue hath a little sting:
                  He lurkes in flowres, he pearcheth on the trees,
                  He on Kings pillowes, bends his prettie knees:
                  The Boy is blinde, but when he will not spie,
                  He hath a leaden foote, and wings to flie:
                  Beshrow me yet, for all these strange effects,
                  If I would like the Lad, that so infects.

                  Sir Bar.
                  By sweet S. Andrew and may sale I sweare,
                  As welcom is my honest Dick to me,
                  As mornings sun, or as the watry moone,
                  In merkist night, when we the borders track.
                  I tell thee Dick, thy sight hath cleerd my thoughts,
                  Of many banefull troubles that there woond.
                  Welcome to sir Bartram as his life:
                  
                     
Tell me bonny Dicke, hast got a wife?
               
               
                  Eust.
                  A wife God shield sir Bartram, that were ill
                  To leaue my wife and wander thus astray:
                  But time and good aduise ere many yeares,
                  May chance to make my fancie bend that way,
                  What newes in Scotland? therefore came I hither:
                  To see your Country, and to chat togither.
               
               
                  Sir Bar.
                  Why man our Countries blyth, our king is well,
                  Our Queene so, so, the Nobles well, and worse
                  And weele are they that were about the king,
                  But better are the Country Gentlemen.
                  And I may tell thee Eustace, in our liues,
                  We old men neuer saw so wondrous change:
                  But leaue this trattle, and tell me what newes,
                  In louely England with our honest friends?
               
               
                  Eust.
                  The king, the Court, and all our noble frends
                  Are well, and God in mercy keepe them so.
                  The Northren Lords and Ladies here abouts,
                  That knowes I came to see your Queen and Court,
                  Commends them to my honest friend sir Bartram,
                  
                  And many others that I haue not seene:
                  Among the rest, the Countesse Elinor from Carlile
                  
                  Where we merry oft haue bene,
                  Greets well my Lord, and hath directed me,
                  By message this faire Ladies face to see.
               
               
                  Sir Bar.
                  I tell thee Eustace, lest mine old eyes daze,
                  This is our Scottish moone and euenings pride:
                  This is the blemish of your English Bride:
                  Who sailes by her, are sure of winde at will.
                  Her face is dangerous, her sight is ill:
                  And yet in sooth sweet Dicke, it may be said,
                  The king hath folly, their's vertue in the mayd.
               
               
                  Eust.
                  But knows my friend this portrait, be aduisd?

                  Eust.
                  So was I told by Elinor of Carlile,
                  
                  But tell me louely Bartram, is the maid euil inclind,
                  Misled, or Concubine vnto the King or any other Lord?

                  Of vertue, honour, beautie, and the rest:
                  But our fōd king not knowing sin in lust,
                  Makes loue by endlesse meanes and precious gifts,
                  And men that see it dare not sayt my friend,
                  But wee may wish that it were otherwise:
                  But I rid thee to view the picture still,
                  For by the persons sights there hangs som ill.
               
               
                  Ba.
                  Oh good sir Bartram, you suspect I loue,
                  Then were I mad, hee whom I neuer sawe,
                  But how so ere, I feare not entisings,
                  Desire will giue no place vnto a king:
                  Ile see her whom the world admires so much,
                  That I may say with them, there liues none such.

                  That follow flatterers, lust and lawlesse will,
                  And then say I haue reason to forsake the world,

                  Beheld in tombde, and weeping did confesse
                  Nothing in life could scape from wrethednesse:

                  Wherein my daughter shuld your liking be?

                  Since these are meanes to draw the minde
                  From perfect good, and make true iudgement blind.

                  Are fashioned fresh, some in their stalkes do close,
                  And borne do suddaine die: some are but weeds,
                  And yet from them a secret good proceeds:
                  I with my needle if I please may blot,
                  The fairest rose within my cambricke plot,
                  God with a becke can change each worldly thing,
                  The poore to earth, the begger to the king.
                  What then hath man, wherein hee well may boast,
                  Since by a becke he liues, a louer is lost?

                  Good sir, my daughter learnes this rule of mee,
                  To shun resort, and straungers companie:
                  For some are shifting mates that carrie letters,
                  Some such as you too good, because our betters.
               
               
                  Slip.
                  Now I pray you sir what a kin are you to a pickrell?
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Why knaue?
               
               
                  Slip.
                  By my troth sir, because I neuer knew a proper scituation
fellow of your pitch, fitter to swallow a gudgin.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  What meanst thou by this?
               
               
                  Slip.
                  Shifting fellow sir, these be thy words, shifting fellow:
                  This Gentlewoman I feare me, knew your bringing vp.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  How so?
               
               
                  Slip.
                  Why sir your father was a Miller,
                  That could shift for a pecke of grist in a bushell,
                  And you a faire spoken Gentleman, that can get more land by
a lye, then an honest man by his readie mony.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Catiue what sayest thou?
               
               
                  Slip.
                  I say sir, that if shee call you shifting knaue,
                  You shall not put her to the proofe.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  And why?
               
               
                  Slip.
                  Because sir, liuing by your wit as you doo shifting, is
your letters pattents, it were a hard matter for mee to get my
dinner that day, wherein my Maister had not solde a dozen of
deuices, a case of cogges, and a shute of shifts in the morning:
I speak this in your commendation sir, &amp; I pray you so take it.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  If I liue knaue I will bee reuenged, what Gentleman
would entertaine a rascall, thus to derogate from his honour?
               
               
                  Ida.
                  My Lord why are you thus impatient?
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Not angrie Ida, but I teach this knaue,
                  How to behaue himselfe among his betters:
                  Behold faire Countesse to assure your stay,
                  I heere present the signet of the king,
                  Who now by mee faire Ida doth salute you:
                  And since in secret I haue certaine things,
                  
                     
In his behalfe good Madame to impart,
                  I craue your daughter to discourse a part.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Shee shall in humble dutie bee addrest,
                  To do his Highnesse will in what shee may.
               
               
                  Id.
                  Now gentle sir what would his grace with me?
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Faire comely Nimph, the beautie of your face,
                  Sufficient to bewitch the heauenly powers,
                  Hath wrought so much in him, that now of late
                  Hee findes himselfe made captiue vnto loue,
                  And though his power and Maiestie requires,
                  A straight commaund before an humble sute,
                  Yet hee his mightinesse doth so abase,
                  As to intreat your fauour honest maid.
               
               
                  Ida.
                  Is hee not married sir vnto our Queen?
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Hee is.
               
               
                  Ida.
                  And are not they by God accurst,
                  That seuer them whom hee hath knit in one?
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  They bee: what then? wee seeke not to displace
                  The Princesse from her seate, but since by loue
                  The king is made your owne, shee is resolude
                  In priuate to accept your dalliance,
                  In spight of warre, watch, or worldly eye.
               
               
                  Ida.
                  Oh how hee talkes as if hee should not die,
                  As if that God in iustice once could winke,
                  Vpon that fault I am a sham'd to thinke.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Tut Mistresse, man at first was born to erre,
                  Women are all not formed to bee Saints:
                  Tis impious for to kill our natiue king,
                  Whom by a little fauour wee may saue.
               
               
                  Ida.
                  Better then liue vnchaste, to liue in graue.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Hee shall erect your state &amp; wed you well.
               
               
                  Ida.
                  But can his warrant keep my soule from hell?
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  He will inforce, if you resist his sute.
               
               
                  Id.
                  What tho, the world may shame to him account
                  To bee a king of men and worldly pelfe.
               
               
                  
                  Ateu.
                  Yet hath to power no rule and guide himselfe,
                  I know you gentle Ladie and the care,
                  Both of your honour and his graces health,
                  Makes me confused in this daungerous state.
               
               
                  Ida.
                  So counsell him, but sooth thou not his sinne,
                  Tis vaine alurement that doth make him loue,
                  I shame to heare, bee you a shamde to mooue,
               
               
                  Count.
                  I see my daughter growes impatient,
                  I feare me hee pretends some bad intent.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Will you dispise the king, &amp; scorne him so?
               
               
                  Ida.
                  In all alleageance I will serue his grace,
                  But not in lust, oh how I blush to name it?
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  An endlesse worke is this, how should I frame it?
               
               They discourse priuately.
               
                  Slip.
                  Oh Mistresse may I turne a word vpon you.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Friend what wilt thou?
               
               
                  Slip.
                  Oh what a happie Gentlewoman bee you trulie, the
world reports this of you Mistresse, that a man can no sooner
come to your house, but the Butler comes with a blacke Iack
and sayes welcome friend, he eres a cup of the best for you, verilie
Mistresse you are said to haue the best Ale in al Scotland.
                  
               
               
                  Count.
                  Sirrha go fetch him drinke, how likest thou this?
               
               
                  Slip.
                  Like it Mistresse? why this is quincy quarie pepper
de watchet, single goby, of all that euer I tasted: Ile prooue in
this Ale and tost, the compasse of the whole world. First this
is the earth, it ties in the middle a faire browne tost, a goodly
countrie for hungrie teeth to dwell vpon: next this is the sea,
a fair poole for a drie tōgue to fish in: now come I, &amp; seing the
world is naught, I diuide it thus, &amp; because the sea cānot stand
without the earth, as Arist. saith, I put thē both into their first

                     Chaos which is my bellie, and so mistresse you may see your ale
is become a myracle.
               
               
                  Eustace.
                  A merrie mate Madame I promise you.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Why sigh you sirrah?
               
               
                  Slip.
                  Trulie Madam, to think vppon the world, which since
I denoūced, it keepes such a rumbling in my stomack, that vnlesse
your Cooke giue it a counterbuffe with some of your rosted
Capons or beefe, I feare me I shal become a loose body, so
daintie I thinke, I shall neither hold fast before nor behinde.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Go take him in and feast this merrie swaine,
                  Syrrha, my cooke is your phisitian.
                  He hath a purge for to disiest the world.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Will you not, Ida, grant his highnesse this?
               
               
                  Ida.
                  As I haue said, in dutie I am his:
                  For other lawlesse lusts, that ill beseeme him,
                  I cannot like, and good I will not deeme him.
               
               
                  Count.
                  
                     Ida come in, and sir if so you please,
                  Come take a homelie widdowes intertaine.
               
               
                  Ida.
                  If he haue no great haste, he may come nye.
                  If haste, tho he be gone, I will not crie.
               
               Exeunt.
               
                  Ateu.
                  I see this labour lost, my hope in vaine,
                  Yet will I trie an other drift againe.
               
               Enter the Bishop of S. Andrewes, Earle Douglas,
Morton, with others, one way, the Queene with
Dwarfes an other way.

                  Madame call helpe, and boldly fight it to,
                  Altho a Bee be but a litle thing:
                  You know faire Queen, it hath a bitter sting.
               
               
                  Dor.
                  How couldst thou do me good were I in greefe?

                  If we with patience may attentiue gaine,

                  As fortune mightie Princes reareth some,
                  To high estate, and place in Common-weale,
                  So by diuine bequest to them is lent,
                  A riper iudgement and more searching eye:
                  Whereby they may discerne the common harme,
                  For where importunes in the world are most,
                  Where all our profits rise and still increase,
                  There is our minde, thereon we meditate,
                  And what we do partake of good aduice,
                  
                     
That we imploy for to concerne the same.)

                  His lawlesse and vnbridled vaine in loue,
                  His to intentiue trust too flatterers,
                  His abiect care of councell and his friendes,
                  Cannot but greeue, and since we cannot drawe
                  His eye or Iudgement to discerne is faults
                  Since we haue spake and counsaile is not heard,
                  I for my part, (let others as they list)
                  Will leaue the Court, and leaue him to his will:
                  Least with a ruthfull eye I should behold,
                  His ouer throw which sore I feare is nye.

                  Ah father are you so estranged from loue,
                  From due alleageance to your Prince and land,
                  To leaue your King when most he needs your help,
                  The thriftie husbandmen, are neuer woont
                  That see their lands vnfruitfull, to forsake them:
                  But when the mould is barraine and vnapt,
                  They toyle, they plow, and make the fallow fatte:
                  The pilot in the dangerous seas is knowne,
                  In calmer waues the sillie sailor striues,
                  Are you not members Lords of Common-weale,
                  And can your head, your deere annointed King,
                  Default ye Lords, except your selues do faile?
                  Oh stay your steps, returne and counsaile him.

                  Men seek not mosse vpon a rowling stone,
                  Or water from the siue, or fire from yce:
                  Or comfort from a rechlesse monarkes hands.
                  Madame he sets vs light that seru'd in Court,
                  In place of credit in his fathers dayes,
                  If we but enter presence of his grace,
                  Our payment is a frowne, a scoffe, a frumpe,
                  Whilst flattering Gnato prancks it by his side,

                  I and why not sir, for the greatest Clarkes are not the
wisest, and a foole may dance in a hood, as wel as a wise man in

                  The practise of your daungers came to light:
                  
                     
Next let the tokens of appooued trueth,
                  Gouerne and stay your thoughts, too much seduc't,
                  And marke the sooth, and listen the intent,
                  Your highnesse knowes, and these my noble Lords,
                  Can witnesse this, that whilest your husbands sirre
                  In happie peace possest the Scottish Crowne,
                  I was his sworne attendant heere in Court,
                  In daungerous fight I neuer fail'd my Lord.
                  And since his death, and this your husbands raigne,
                  No labour, dutie, haue I left vndone,
                  To testifie my zeale vnto the Crowne:
                  But now my limmes are weake, mine eyes are dim,
                  Mine age vnweldie and vnmeete for toyle:
                  I came to court in hope for seruice past,
                  To gaine some lease to keepe me beeing olde,
                  There found I all was vpsie turuy turnd,
                  My friends displac'ft, the Nobles loth to craue,
                  Then sought I to the minion of the King,
                  
                     Auteukin, who allured by a bribe,
                  Assur'd me of the lease for which I sought:
                  But see the craft, when he had got the graunt,
                  He wrought to sell it to Sir Siluester,
                  
                  In hope of greater earnings from his hands:
                  In briefe, I learnt his craft, and wrought the meanes,
                  By one his needie seruants for reward,
                  To steale from out his pocket all the briefes,
                  Which hee perform'd, and with reward resignd
                  Them when I read now marke the power of God)
                  I found this warrant seald among the rest,
                  To kill your grace, whom God long keepe aliue.
                  Thus in effect, by wonder are you sau'd,
                  Trifle not then, bnt seeke a speakie flight,

                  Go, and the rot consume thee? Oh what a trim world
is this? My maister lius by cousoning the king, I by fllattering
him: Slipper my fellow by stealing: and I by lying: is not this
a wylie accord, Gentlemen. This last night our iolly horsekeeper
beeing well stept in licor, confessed to me the stealing of
my Maisters writings, and his great reward: now dare I not
bewraye him, least he discouer my knauerie, but thus haue I
wrought: I vnderstand he will passe this way, to prouide him
necessaries, but if I and my fellowes faile not, wee will teach
him such a lesson, as shall cost him a chiefe place on pennilesse
bench for his labour: but yond he comes.

                  Slip.
                  Oh friend, thou art a simple fellow, I tell thee, a flap is
a great friend to a storrie, it stands him in stead of cleane napery,
and if a mans shert bee torne, it is a present penthouse to
defend him from a cleane huswifes scoffe.
               
               
                  Tay.

Well, I will then binde the hole credit of their occupatiō

                  Doro.
                  Ah Nano, I am wearie of these weedes,
                  Wearie to weeld this weapon that I bare:
                  Wearie of loue, from whom my woe proceedes.
                  
                     
Wearie of toyle, since I haue lost my deare,
                  O wearie life, where wanted no distresse,
                  But euery thought is paide with heauinesse.
               
               
                  Na.
                  Too much of wearie madame, if you please,
                  Sit downe, let wearie dye, and take your ease.
               
               
                  Dorot.
                  How looke I Nano like a man or no?
               
               
                  Nano.
                  If not a man, yet like a manlie shrowe.

                  If any come and meete vs on the way,
                  What should we do if they inforce vs stay.
               
               
                  Na.
                  Set cap a huffe, and challenge him the field,

                  The battaile Nano in this troubled minde,
                  Is farre more fierce then euer we may finde.
                  The bodies wounds by medicines may be eased,
                  But griefes of mindes, by salues are not appeased.

                  To such as hope successe, such noats breede ease.
               
               
                  Na.
                  What if I sing like Damon to my sheepe?
               
               
                  Dor.
                  Like Phillis I will sit me downe to weepe.
               
               
                  Na.
                  Nay since my songs afford such pleasure small,
                  Ile sit me downe, and sing you none at all.
               
               
                  Doro.
                  Oh be not angrie Nano.
                  
               
               
                  Nano.
                  Nay you loath,
                  To thinke on that, which doth content vs both.
               
               
                  Dore.
                  And how?
               
               
                  Nano.
                  You scorne desport when you are wearie,
                  And loath my mirth, who liue to make you merry.
               
               
                  Doro.
                  Danger and fear withdraw me from delight.
               
               
                  Na.
                  Tis vertue to contemne fals Fortunes spight.
               
               
                  Do.
                  What shuld I do to please thee friendly squire?
               
               
                  Na.
                  A smile a day, is all I will require:
                  And if you pay me well the smiles you owe me,
                  Ile kill this cursed care, or else beshrowe me.
               
               
                  
                  Doug.
                  We are descried, oh Mano we are dead.
               
               Enter Iaques his sword drawne.
               
                  Nano.
                  Tut yet you walk, you are not dead indeed,
                  Drawe me your sword, if he your way withstand.
               
               
                  Do.
                  And I will seeke for rescue out of hand,
                  Run Nano runne, preuent thy Princes death.
               
               
                  Na.
                  Feare not, ile run all danger out of breath.

                  Callet, me strumpet, Catiue as thou art

                  Of threats of forraine force will be afraid.
               
               
                  Iaq.

                  God sheeld me haplesse princes and a wife.
                  They fight, and shee is sore wounded.
                  And saue my soule, altho I loose my life.
                  Ah I am slaine, some piteous power repay,

                  Exit.
               
               Enter Nano, S. Cutbert Anderson,
his sword drawne.
               
                  S. Cutb.
                  Where is this poore distressed gentleman?
               
               
                  Nano.
                  Here laid on ground, and wounded to the death.
                  Ah gentle heart, how are these beautious lookes,
                  Dimd by the tyrant cruelties of death:
                  Oh wearie soule, breake thou from forth my brest,
                  And ioyne thee with the soule I honoured most.
               
               
                  S. Cut.
                  Leaue mourning friend, the man is yet aliue,

There will I see him carefully recured,
                  And send priuie search to catch the murtherer.
               
               
                  Nano.
                  The God of heauen reward the curteous knight.
                  Exeunt.
                  And they beare out Dorothea.
                  
               
               Enter the King of Scots, laques, Ateukin, Andrew, Iaques
running with his swoord one way, the King with his
traine an other way.
               
                  K. of S.
                  Stay Iaques, feare not, sheath thy murthering blade:
                  Loe here thy King and friends are come abroad,
                  To saue thee from the terrors of pursuite:
                  What is she dead?
               
               
                  Iaq.
                  Wee Monsieur, elle is blesse per lake teste, ouesles espanles,
I warrant she no trouble you.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Oh then my liege, how happie art thou growne,
                  How fauoured of the heauens, and blest by loue:
                  Mee thinkes I see faire Ida in thine armes,
                  Crauing remission for her late attempt,
                  Mee thinke I see her blushing steale a kisse:
                  Vniting both your soules by such a sweete,
                  And you my King suck Nectar from her lips.
                  Why then delaies your grace to gaine the rest
                  You long desired? why loose we forward time?
                  Write, make me spokesman now, vow marriage,
                  If she deny your fauour let me die.
               
               
                  Andr.
                  Mightie and magnificent potentate, giue credence to
mine honorable good Lord, for I heard the Midwife sweare at
his natiuitie, that the Faieries gaue him the propertie of the
Thracian stone, for who toucheth it, is exempted from griefe,
and he that heareth my Maisters counsell, is alreadie possessed
of happinesse: nay which is more myraculous, as the Noble
man in his infancie lay in his Cradle, a swarme of Bees laid honey
on his lippes, in token of his eloquence. For melle dulcier
fluit oratio.
                  
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Your grace must beare with imperfections:
                  This is exceeding loue that makes him speake.
               
               
                  
                  K. of S.
                  
                     Ateukin I am rauisht in conceit,
                  And yet deprest againe with earnest thoughts,
                  Me thinkes this murther soundeth in mine eare,
                  A threatning noyse of dire and sharp reuenge▪
                  
                  I am incenst with greefe, yet faine would ioy,
                  What may I do to end me of these doubts?
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Why Prince it is no murther in a King▪
                  
                  To end an others life to saue his owne,
                  For you are not as common people bee.
                  Who die and perish with a fewe mans teares,
                  But if you faile, the state doth whole default
                  The Realme is rent in twaine, in such alosse,
                  And Aristotle holdeth this for true,
                  Of euills needs we must chuse the least,
                  Then better were it, that a woman died,
                  Then all the helpe of Scotland should be blent,
                  Tis pollicie my liege, in euerie state,
                  To cut off members that disturbe the head.
                  And by corruption generation growes.
                  And contraries maintaine the world and state.
               
               
                  K. of S.
                  Enough I am confirmed, Ateukin come,
                  Rid me of loue, and rid me of my greefe,
                  Driue thou the tyrant from this tainted brest▪
                  
                  Then may I triumph in the height of ioy,
                  Go to mine Ida, tell her that I vowe,
                  To raise her head and make her honours great.
                  Go to mine Ida, tell her that her haires,
                  Salbe embollished with orient pearles,
                  And Crownes of Saphyrs compassing her browes,
                  Shall weare with those sweete beauties of her eyes.
                  Go to mine Ida, tell her that my soule
                  Shall keepe her semblance closed in my brest,
                  And I in touching of her milke-white mould,
                  Will thinke me deified in such a grace:
                  I like no stay, go write and I will signe.
                  
                     
Reward me Iaques, giue him store of Crowne.
                  And sirrha Andrew, scout thou here in Court:
                  And bring me tydings if thou canst perceiue
                  The least intent of muttering in my traine,

                  Was neuer such a world I thinke before,
                  When sinners seeme to daunce within a net,
                  The flatterer and the murtherer they grow big,
                  By hooke of crooke promotion now is sought,
                  In such a world where men are so missed,
                  What should I do? but as the Prouerbe saith,
                  Runne with the Hare, and hunt with the Hound.
                  To haue two meanes, beseemes a wittie man:

                      I may aspire and clime,

                     I will in secret certaine letters send
                  Vnto the English King, and let him know
                  The order of his daughters ouer throw.
                  That if my maister crack his credit here,
                  As I am sure long flattery cannot hold,
                  I may haue meanes within the English Court
                  To scape the scourge that waits on bad aduice.

                  If better motions yet then any past,
                  Do not more glee to make the fairie greet,
                  But my small son made prittie hansome shift,

                  My gentle friend beware in taking aire,
                  Your walkes growe not offensiue to your woundes.
               
               
                  Do.
                  Madame I thank you of your courteous care,
                  My wounds are well nigh clos'd, tho sore they are.
               
               
                  L. And.
                  Me thinks these closed wounds should breed more griefe,
                  Since open wounds haue cure, and find reliefe.
               
               
                  Dor.
                  Madame, if vndiscouered wounds you meane,
                  They are not curde, because they are not seene.
               
               
                  L. And.
                  I meane the woundes which do the heart subdue.
               
               
                  Nano.
                  Oh that is loue, Madame speake I not true?

                  La. And.
                  Say it were true, what salue for such a sore?
               
               
                  Nano.
                  Be wise, and shut such neighbours out of dore.
               
               
                  
                  La. And.
                  How if I cannot driue him from my brest?
               
               
                  Nano.
                  Then chaine him well, and let him do his best.
               
               
                  S. Cutb.
                  In ripping vp their wounds, I see their wit,
                  But if these woundes be cured I sorrow it.
               
               
                  Doro.
                  Why are you so intentiue to behold,

                  Because in them a readie way is found,

                  Peace wanton son, this Ladie did amend
                  My woundes: mine eyes her hidden griefe shall end,

                  Where as a man puts on a maidens face,
                  For many times if Ladies weare them not,
                  A nine moneths wound with little worke is got.

                  Thankes gentle knight, and if all hopes be true,
                  I hope ere long to do as much for you.

                  Your vertue doth acquite me of that doubt:

                  The king of England forrageth his land,
                  And hath besieged Dambac with mightie force:

Where soule is reft from that it loueth best,
                  How can it thriue or boast of quiet rest?
                  Thou knowest the Princes losse must be my death,
                  His griefe, my griefe: his mischiefe must be mine:

                  Haste thee good Nana, for my husbands care,
                  Consumeth mee and wounds mee to the heart.

               After a solemne seruice, enter from the widdowes house a seruice,
musical songs of marriages, or a maske, or what prettie
triumph you list, to them, Ateukin and Gnato.
               
                  Ate.
                  What means this triumph frend? why are these feasts?
               
               
                  Serui.
                  Faire Ida sir, was marryed yesterday,
                  Vnto sir Eustace, and for that intent,
                  Wee feast and sport it thus to honour them:
                  And if you please, come in and take your part,
                  My Ladie is no niggard of her cheare.
                  Exit.
               
               
                  
                  Iaq.
                  Monsigneur, why be you so sadda, fette bon chere fontre
de ce monde.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  What? was I borne to bee the scorne of kinne?
                  To gather feathers like to a hopper crowe,
                  And loose them in the height of all my pompe:
                  Accursed man now is my credite lost:
                  Where is my vowes I made vnto the king?
                  What shall become of mee, if hee shall heare,
                  That I haue causde him kill a vertuous Queene?
                  And hope in vaine for that which now is lost:
                  Where shall I hide my head? I knowe the heauens
                  Are iust, and will reuenge: I know my sinnes
                  Exceede compare: should I proceed in this?
                  This Eustace must a man be made away:
                  Oh were I dead, how happy should I bee?
               
               
                  Iaq.
                  Est ce donque a tell poynt vostre estat, faith then
adeiu Scotland, adeiu Signior Ateukin, me will homa
to France, and no be hanged in a strange country.
                  
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Ateu.
                  Thou doest me good to leaue me thus alone,
                  That galling griefe and I may yoake in one:
                  Oh what are subtile meanes to clime on high?
                  When euery fall swarmes with exceeding shame?
                  I promist Idaes loue vnto the Prince,
                  But shee is lost, and I am false forsworne:
                  I practis'd Dorotheas haplesse death,
                  And by this practise haue commenst a warre.
                  Oh cursed race of men that traficque guile,
                  And in the end, themselues and kings beguile:
                  A shamde to looke vpon my Prince againe:
                  A shamde of my suggestions and aduise:
                  A shamde of life: a shamde that I haue erde:
                  Ile hide my selfe, expecting for my shame.
                  Thus God doth worke with those, that purschase fame
                  By flattery, and make their Prince their gaine.
               
               Exeunt.
               Enter the King of England, Lord Percey, Samles, and others.

                  Thus farre the English Peeres haue we displayde,
                  Our wauing Ensignes with a happy warre,
                  Thus neerely hath our furious rage reuengde,
                  My daughters death vpon the traiterous Scot,
                  And now before Dambar our campe is pitcht,
                  Which if it yeeld not to our compremise,
                  The place shall furrow where the pallace stood,
                  And furie shall enuy so high a power,
                  That mercie shall bee bannisht from our swords.
               
               
                  Doug.
                  What seekes the English King?
               
               
                  Arius.
                  Scot open those gates, and let me enter in,
                  Submit thy selfe and thine vnto my grace,
                  Or I will put each mothers sonne to death,
                  And lay this Cittie leuell with the ground.
               
               
                  Doug.
                  For what offence? for what default of ours?
                  Art thou incenst so sore against our state?
                  Can generous hearts in nature bee so sterne
                  To pray on those that neuer did offend?
                  What tho the Lyon, (king of brutish race,
                  Through outrage sinne, shall lambes be therefore slaine?
                  Or is it lawfull that the humble die,
                  Because the mightie do gainsay the right?
                  O English King, thou bearest in thy brest,
                  The King of beasts, that harmes not yeelding ones,
                  The Ros

                     all crosse is spred within thy field,
                  A signe of peace, not of reuenging warre:
                  Be gracious then vnto this little towne,
                  And tho we haue withstood thee for a while,
                  To shew alleageance to our liefest liege,
                  Yet since wee know no hope of any helpe,
                  Take vs to mercie, for wee yeeld our selues.
               
               
                  Ari.
                  What shall I enter then and be your Lord?
               
               
                  Doug.
                  We will submit vs to the English king.
                  They descend downe, open the gates, and humble them.
               
               
                  Arius.
                  Now life and death dependeth on my sword:
                  
                     
This hand now reard, my Douglas if I list,
                  Could part thy head and shoulders both in twaine:
                  But since I see thee wise and olde in yeares,
                  True to thy king, and faithfull in his warres,
                  Liue thou and thine, Dambar is too too small▪
                  
                  To giue an entrance to the English king,
                  I Eaglelike disdaine these little foules,
                  And looke on none but those that dare resist,
                  Enter your towne as those that liue by me,
                  For others that resist, kill, forrage, spoyle:
                  Mine English souldiers, as you loue your king,
                  Reuenge his daughters death, and do me right.
               
               Exeunt,
               Enter the Lawyer, the Merchant, and the Diuine.
               
                  Lawyer.
                  My friends, what thinke you of this present state▪
                  
                  Were euer seene such changes in a time?
                  The manners and the fashions of this age,
                  Are like the Ermine skinne so full of spots,
                  As soone may the Moore bee washed white,
                  Then these corruptions bannisht from this Realme.
               
               
                  Merch.
                  What sees mas Lawyer in this state amisse?
               
               
                  Law.
                  A wresting power that makes a nose of wax,
                  Of grounded lawe, a damde and subtile drift,
                  In all estates to clime by others losse,
                  An eager thrift of wealth, forgetting trueth,
                  Might I ascend vnto the highest states,
                  And by discent discouer euery crime,
                  My friends I should lament, and you would greeue
                  To see the haplesse ruines of this Realme.
               
               
                  Diu.
                  O Lawyer, thou haste curious eyes to prie,
                  Into the secrets maimes of their estate,
                  But if thy vaile of error were vnmaskt,
                  Thy selfe should see your sect, do maime her most:
                  Are you not those that should maintaine the peace,
                  Yet onely are the patrones of our strife?
                  
                     
If your profession haue his ground and spring,
                  First from the lawes of God, then countriees right,
                  Not any waies inuerting natures power,
                  Why thriue you by contentions? Why deuise you
                  Clawses, and subtile reasons to except:
                  Our state was first before you grew so great,
                  A Lanterne to the world for vnitie:
                  Now they that are befriended, and are rich,
                  Or presse the poore, come Homer without quoine,
                  He is not heard: What shall we terme this drift?
                  To say the poore mans cause is good and iust,
                  And yet the rich man gaines the best in lawe:
                  It is your guise, (the more the world laments)
                  To quoine Prouisoes to beguile your lawes,
                  To make a gay pretext of due proceeding,
                  When you delay your common pleas for yeares:
                  Mark what these dealings lately here haue wroght:
                  The craftie men haue purchaste greatmens lands
                  They powle, they pinch, their tennants are vndone:
                  If these complaine by you they are vndone,
                  You fleese them of their quoine, their children beg,
                  And many want, because you may bee rich,
                  This scarre is mightie maister Lawyer,
                  Now man hath gotten head within this land,
                  Marke but the guise, the poore man that is wrongd,
                  Is readie to rebell: hee spoyles, he pilles,
                  We need no foes to forrage that wee haue,
                  The lawe (say they) in peace consumed vs,
                  And now in warre wee will consume the lawe:
                  Looke to this mischiefe, Lawyers conscience knowes
                  You liue amisse, amend it, least you end.
               
               
                  Law.
                  Good Lord, that their Diuines should see so farre
                  In others faults, without amending theirs?
                  Sir, sir, the generall defaults in state,
                  
                     
(If you would read before you did correct)
                  Are by a hidden working from aboue,
                  By their successiue changes still remainde,
                  Were not the lawe by contraries maintainde,
                  How could the trueth from falsehood be discernde?
                  Did wee not tast the bitternesse of warre?
                  How could wee knowe the sweet effects of peace?
                  Did wee not feele the nipping winter frostes,
                  How should we know the sweetnesse of the spring?
                  Should all things still remaine in one estate,
                  Should not in greatest arts some scarres be found,
                  Were all vpright and changd, what world were this?
                  A Chaos, made of quiet, yet no world,
                  Because the parts there of did still accord,
                  This matter craues a variance not a speech,
                  But sir Diuine to you, looke on your maimes,
                  Diuisions, sects, your summonies and bribes:
                  Your cloaking with the great, for feare to fall,
                  You shall perceiue you are the cause of all.
                  Did each man know there were a storme at hand,
                  Who would not cloath him well, to shun the wet?
                  Did Prince and Peere, the Lawyer and the least,
                  Know what were sinne, without a partiall glose,
                  Wee need no long discouery then of crimes,
                  For each would mend, aduis'de by holy men:
                  Thus but slightly shadow out your sinnes,
                  But if they were depainted out for life,
                  Alasse wee both had wounds inough to heale.
               
               
                  Merch.
                  None of you both I see but are in fault,
                  Thus simple men as I do swallow flies,
                  This graue Diuine can tell vs what to do.
                  But wee may say: Phisitian mend thy selfe,
                  This Lawyer hath a pregnant wit to talke,
                  But all are words, I see no deeds of woorth.
               
               
                  Law.
                  Good Merchant lay your fingers on your mouth,
                  
                     
Be not a blab, for feare you bite your selfe,
                  What should I terme your state, but euen the way
                  To euery ruine in this Common-weale,
                  Your bring vs in the meanes of all excesse,
                  You rate it▪ and retalde it as you please,
                  You sweare, forsweare, and all to compasse wealth,
                  Your mony is your God, your hoord your heauen,
                  You are the ground worke of contention:
                  First heedlesse youth, by you is ouerreacht,
                  Wee are corrupted by your many crownes:
                  The Gentlemen whose titles you haue bought,
                  Loose all their fathers toyle within a day,
                  Whilst Hob your sonne, and Sib your nutbrowne childe,
                  Are Gentle folkes, and Gentles are beguilde:
                  This makes so many Noble maides to stray,
                  And take sinister courses in the state.
               
               Enter a Scout.
               
                  Scout.
                  My friends begone and if you loue your liues,
                  The King of England marcheth heere at hand,
                  Enter the campe for feare you bee surprisde.
               
               
                  Diuine.
                  Thankes gentle scout, God mend that is amisse,
                  And place true, zeale whereas corruption is.
               
               Exeun.
               Enter Dorothea, Ladie Anderson and Nano.
               
                  Doro.
                  What newes in Court, Nano let vs know it?
               
               
                  Nano.
                  If so you please my Lord, I straight will shew it:
                  The English king hath all the borders spoyld,
                  Hath taken Morton prisoner, and hath slaine
                  Seuen thousand Scottish Lords, not farre from Tweards.
                  
               
               
                  Doro.
                  A wofull murther, and a bloodie deed.
               
               
                  Nano.

                  The other moues me for my murthred Queene.
                  Thus finde I greefe of that whereon I ioy,
                  And doubt, in greatest hope, and death in weale,
                  Ah lasse what hell may be compared with mine,
                  Since in extreames my comforts do consist?
                  Warre then will cease, when dead ones are reuiued.

                  Alas what thronging thoughts do me oppresse?
                  Iniurious loue is partiall in my right,
                  And flattering tongues by whom I was misled,
                  Haue laid a snare to spoyle my state and me.

Howling reuenge for my accursed hate,

                  Pursue me crying out, woe, woe, to lust,
                  The foe pursues me at my pallace doore:
                  He breakes my rest and spoyles me in my Camp,
                  Ah flattering broode of Sicophants my foes,
                  First shall my dire reuenge begin on you,
                  I will reward thee Andrew.

                  Slip.
                  Then I pray sir giue me all, I am as ready for a reward as
an oyster for a fresh tide, spare not me sir.
               
               
                  K. of S.
                  Then hang them both as traitors to the King.

                  The case is altered, sir, ile none of your gifts, what I take

better conscience.

                  The friend against his friend, a deadly friend:
                  A desperate diuision in those lands,
                  Which if they ioyne in one, commaund the world.
                  Oh stay with reason mittigate your rage,
                  And let an old man humbled on his knees,
                  Intreat a boone good Princes of you both.

                  I condiscend, for why thy reuerend years
                  Import some newes of truth and consequence,
                  I am content, for Anderson I know.

                  But by your gratious fauours grant me this,
                  To sweare vpon your sword to do me right.
               
               
                  K. of Eng.
                  See by my sword, and by a Princes faith,
                  In euery lawfull sort I am thine owne.
               
               
                  K. of S.
                  And by my Scepter and the Scottish Crowne,
                  I am resolu'd to grant thee thy request.

                  I see you trust me Princes who repose,
                  The waight of such a warre vpon my will.
                  Now marke my sute, a tender Lyons whelpe,
                  This other day came stragling in the woods,
                  Attended by a young and tender hinde,
                  In courage hautie, yet tyred like a lambe,
                  The Prince of beasts had left this young in keepe,
                  To foster vp as louemate and compeere,
                  Vnto the Lyons mate a naibour friend,
                  This stately guide seduced by the fox,
                  Sent forth an eger Woolfe bred vp in France,
                  
                  That gript the tender whelp, and wounded it.
                  By chance as I was hunting in the woods,
                  I heard the moane the hinde made for the whelpe,
                  I tooke them both, and brought them to my house,
                  With charie care I haue 
                        ••
                     curde the one,
                  And since I know the lyons are at strife,
                  About the losse and dammage of the young,
                  
                     
I bring her home, make claime to her who list.
               
               Hee discouereth her.
               
                  Doro.
                  I am the whelpe, bred by this Lyon vp,
                  This royall English king my happy sire,
                  Poore Nano is the hinde that tended me:
                  My father Scottish king▪ gaue me to thee:
                  A haplesse wife, thou quite misled by youth,
                  Haste sought sinister loues and forraine ioyes,
                  The fox Ateukin, cursed Parasite,
                  Incenst your grace to send the woolfe abroad,
                  The French borne Iaques, for to end my daies,
                  Hee traiterous man, pursued me in the woods,
                  And left mee wounded, where this noble knight,
                  Both rescued me and mine, and sau'd my life.
                  Now keep thy promise, Dorothea liues:
                  Giue Anderson his due and iust reward:
                  And since you kings, your warres began by me,
                  Since I am safe, returne surcease your fight.
               
               
                  K. of S.
                  Durst I presume to looke vpon those eies,
                  Which I haue tired with a world of woes,
                  Or did I thinke submission were ynough,
                  Or sighes might make an entrance to my soule:
                  You heauens, you know how willing I wold weep:
                  You heauens can tell, how glad I would submit:
                  You heauens can say, how firmly I would sigh.
               
               
                  Do.
                  Shame me not Prince, companion in thy bed,
                  Youth hath misled: tut but a little fault,
                  Tis kingly to amend what is amisse:
                  Might I with twise as many paines as these,
                  Vnite our hearts, then should my wedded Lord,
                  See how incessaunt labours I would take.
                  My gracious father gouerne your affects,
                  Giue me that hand, that oft hath blest this head,
                  And claspe thine armes, that haue embraced this,
                  About the shoulders of my wedded spouse:
                  Ah mightie Prince, this king and I am one,
                  
                     
Spoyle thou his subiects, thou despoy lest me:
                  Touch thou his brest, thou doest attaint this heart,
                  Oh bee my father then in louing him.

                  Thou prouident kinde mother of increase,
                  Thou must preuaile, ah nature thou must rule:
                  Holde daughter, ioyne my hand and his in one,
                  I will embrace him for to fauour thee,
                  I call him friend, and take him for my sonne.

                  Ah royall husband, see what God hath wrought,
                  Thy foe is now thy friend: good men at armes,
                  Do you the like, these nations if they ioyne,
                  What Monarch with his leigemen in this world,
                  Dare but encounter you in open fields?

                  Al wisedome ioynde with godly pietie,
                  Thou English king, pardon my former youth,
                  And pardon courteous Queen my great misdeed:
                  And for assurance of mine after life,
                  I take religious vowes before my God,
                  To honour thee for fauour, her for wife.

                        〈◊〉
                      English king I humbly do request,
                  That by your meanes our Princesse may vnite,
                  Her loue vnto mine alder truest loue,
                  Now you will loue, maintaine and helpe them both.
               
               
                  K. of Eng.
                  Good Anderson, I graunt thee thy request.
               
               
                  L. And.
                  But you my Prince must yeelde me mickle more:
                  You know your Nobles are your chiefest staies,
                  And long time haue been bannisht from your Court,
                  Embrace and reconcile them to your selfe:
                  They are your hands, whereby you ought to worke.
                  As for Ateukin, and his lewde compeeres,
                  That sooth'd you in your sinnes and youthly pompe,
                  Exile, torment, and punish such as they,
                  For greater vipers neuer may be found
                  Within a state, then such aspiring heads,
                  That reck not how they clime, so that they clime.
               
               
                  
                  K. of S.
                  Guid Knight I graunt thy sute, first I submit
                  And humble craue a pardon of your grace:
                  Next courteous Queene, I pray thee by thy loues,
                  Forgiue mine errors past, and pardon mee.
                  My Lords and Princes, if I haue misdone,
                  (As I haue wrongd indeed both you and yours)
                  Heereafter trust me, you are deare to me:
                  As for Auteukin, who so findes the man,
                  Let him haue Martiall lawe, and straight be hangd,
                  As (all his vaine arbetters now are diuided)
                  And Anderson our Treasurer shall pay,
                  Three thousand Markes, for friendly recompence.
               
               
                  L. Andr.
                  But Princes whilst you friend it thus in one,
                  Me thinks of friendship, Nano shall haue none.
               
               
                  Doro.
                  What would my Dwarfe, that I will not bestow?
               
               
                  Nano.
                  My boone faire Queene is this, that you would go,
                  Altho my bodie is but small and neate,
                  My stomacke after toyle requireth meate,
                  An easie sute, dread Princes will you wend?

                  Art thou a Pigmey borne my prettie frend?
               
               
                  Nano.
                  Not so great King, but nature when she framde me,
                  Was scant of earth, and Nano therefore namde me:
                  And when she sawe my bodie was so small,
                  She gaue me wit to make it big withall.
               
               
                  K.
                  Till time when,
               
               
                  Dor.
                  Eate then.
               
               
                  K.
                  My friend it stands with wit,
                  To take repast when stomacke serueth it.
               
               
                  Dor.
                  Thy pollicie my Nano shall preuaile:
                  Come royall father, enter we my tent:
                  And souldiers feast it, frolike it like friends,
                  My Princes bid this kinde and courteous traine,
                  Partake some fauours of our late accord.
                  Thus warres haue end, and after dreadfull hate,
                  Men learne at last to know their good estate.
               
               Exeunt.
               FINIS.
