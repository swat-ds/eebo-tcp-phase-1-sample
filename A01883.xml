            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE QVEENES
MOST EXCELLENT MAIESTIE,
OVR MOST GRACIOVS
Soueraigne Lady, and my most
honoured Mistris Queene
ANNE.
            
               May it please your most excellent
Maiestie,
            
            
               THE scope and intent
of Christian Religion
seemes onely this, to
raise vp man from the
deapth of miserie and
sinne, to the state of
happinesse and saluation, from whence
he is fallen: in effecting whereof, the onely
powerfull and all-sufficient meanes is
Christ crucified, God in our nature, our
nature with God, God &amp; man reconciled

in the person of Christ, who was both
God and man; here is the great propitiatorie
sacrifice. For particular application
whereof, there is requisite in euery
one, Faith, which (supposing our naturall
blindnesse and ignorance) takes our
selues from our selues, placeth vs in
God, seeing him, and beholding him, we
see no more then he himselfe hath reuealed;
Hope, (supposing our naturall distrust
and fearefulnes) notwithstanding
the number and weight of our sinnes, yet
casts a sure and strong anchor vp into
Heauen, and there laies holde on Gods
promises; Charitie, (supposing mans naturall
disobedience and rebellion) desires
a conformitie of the head to the
members, and of the members betweene
themselues. Thus Faith looks to the wisdome
and truth of Gods nature, stands
astonied at the mysteries, and takes all
the articles of our Creede for her lessons:
Hope fastens on the mercy and goodnesse
of God, by the feruencie of Praier,

and the strong apprehension of the spirit,
making the Lords Praier her patterne
and president: Charitie considers
the rule of Gods iustice, desires to square
all our actions according to leuell, and
lookes to the tables of the Lawe, as her
obiects. Here is the fabricke of the
Church, Faith laies the foundation,
Hope buildes vp the walles, Charitie
giues it a couering, for Charitie doth couer
a multitude of sinnes: but how shall mans
naturall weakenesse attaine to these
Theologicall vertues? As in all great
buildings, so likewise here there are instruments
and tooles appoynted to supplie
our defects; and these are chiefely
and principally Sacraments, and whatsoeuer
else God hath commanded for
his reasonable seruice. This is in effect the
summe of Christian Religion, this is the
summe of our ordinarie Catechisme.
Thus before wee can raise man, he must
first acknowledge his fall: he that shall
intend to make any buildings in Gods

Church, must lay the foundation in
mans fall: for this is the porch or first
entrance which leades vs to Christian
Faith; and therefore speaking hereof, I
thought fit to speake to the capacitie of
the naturall man: herein I shall not need
to straine his vnderstanding, to impose a
yoake of faith, when as his owne reason
shall reueale it in the substance, though
not in the circumstance.
            This fall of man appeares in the miseries
of man, which being truely discouered,
may teach vs what wee are in our
selues. The greatnesse of our woe shewes
the large extent of our sinne: this world
which we inhabit, is but a vale of miserie,
the happinesse of this world, is onely
a painted miserie; in this miserie we may
acknowledge the great mercy of God,
who first created vs in happinesse, and
notwithstanding our sinnes hath still ordained
vs to happinesse; and in these miseries,
he hath giuen vs some ease, as much
as is befitting our present state and condition;

in sustaining these miseries, hee
hath inabled vs with patience, and the
holy comfort of his spirit; and euen our
greatest miseries hee hath taken vpon
himselfe, the more to teach him compassion,
and with his miseries to satisfie for
ours. Thus not onely the blessings and
good gifts of God, but likewise our miseries
set forth his goodnes. And thus as
I haue endeuoured to shew the mercy
and prouidence of God in generall to
whole mankinde, especiallie for our
soules health and saluation; so here making
bolde to write vnto your Maiestie,
I could doe no lesse, then take some notice
of the temporall blessings, wherewith
God hath blessed vs aboue other
people. This blessing especially consists
in gouernment, whereby we receiue the
fruites of peace, of plentie, of happines,
and liue securely vnder the protection
of our Princes; this blessing seemes to
bee proper to this nation, proper to this
present age wherein wee liue: for I will

not speake how in former times, this our
Land was distracted with small principalities
and gouernements; when it should
seeme the greatest part lay waste in borders
and confines, when the strength was
diuided within it selfe; I will onely
beginne with the last age of our forefathers.
            When as the dissention had long continued
between the two houses of Yorke
and Lancaster, it pleased God so to permit,
that the house of Yorke staining it
selfe with his owne blood, when a cruell
and mercilesse tyrant did murther most
innocent and harmelesse Children, and
thereby vsurped the Crowne; this tyrannie
being likewise extended to others,
and a most reuerend Bishop being committed
to safe custodie; (God remembring
Ioseph in all his troubles), his prison was his
castle of defence, and his close keeping
did serue as a counsell-Chamber for secrecie,
where this reuerend Prelate, together
with the greatest lay subiect, as

it were a representatiue Parliament consisting
of Lords Spirituall and Temporall,
Church and state together conspiring,
did there contriue the happy means
of their deliuerie, to bring in Henry of
Richmond to suppresse this tyrant. And God
blessed the successe accordingly, that so
still the same goodnesse of God might
appeare vnto vs, which was once manifested
to the Israelites vnder the tyrannie
of Pharaoh, where the poore innocent
children were likewise put to death, the
crie of my afflicted people is come vp vnto
my eares, Exod. 3. 7.
            This Henry of Richmond being descended
from the house of Lancaster,
did therein seeme to promise vnto the
world all happie successe; for men were
well perswaded of that familie, being all
of them most eminent for great vertues
and qualities (as may appeare) Hen. 4. for
his behauiour and courtesie: the Fifth, for
his valour and magnanimitie: the Sixth,
for his iustice and pietie. Now in the person

of this Henry, it is strange to obserue
the prouidence of God; whereas the
Cambro-Britaines (whom we improperlie
call Welsh) were the most ancient
inhabitants of this Iland, being excluded
and exiled into the most remote and barren
parts, and there not suffered quietlie
to rest, but brought vnder yoake and
subiection, and hauing once beene vanquisht,
yet could neuer bee admitted to
the common libertie of subiects; and
therfore flesh and blood could not withhold
it selfe, or patiently endure such a
bondage, but vpon all occasions they
did continuallie reuolte: beholde, this
good King Henry descended from them,
bearing their name, and therefore by
them making his first entrance into this
happy Kingdome, (in token and memorie
whereof he gaue his eldest Sonne the
name of Arthur) it hath pleased God,
that since that time, no people hath continued
more loyall and obedient to their
Princes then they. So that now, that

which before was spoken more improperly,
and is at this time still carried in
the Armes of our yong Princes (
                  〈…〉
               )
it is truely verified according
to the letter; God laughing at the
counsells of men, can erect the pillar
of his prouidence in the vaine thoughts
and cogitations of man.
            Thus in his person, we may consider
the quieting and pacifying of that nation;
now being possessed of the Crowne,
whereas (in humane policie) his sworde
might haue kept it, as it was wonne by
the sworde, yet it should seeme, that hee
respected rather the good of this kingdome,
and the good of posteritie. And
therefore by the happinesse of his marriage,
hee 
                  〈…〉
                severall families,
by whose diuision so many bloodie
bat
                  •
               ailes had beene fought; our crueltie
was practised vpon our selues▪ our
Townes became vnpeopled, our land
was left desolate, and fourescore Nobles
and Princes of the blood Royall were

slaine and murthered, so that mens
mindes were daily distracted, and vpon
euery dislike of the present gouernement,
men had free refuge to that part,
which they conceiued might bee most
for their aduantage: miserable was the
condition both for Prince and Subiect,
but now are the roses vnited, the houses
conioyned, by a most inseparable bond;
for chaines and linkes of iron are not of
such strength and force, as are the bonds
of mariage.
            After the happinesse of his mariage,
followes the happinesse of his issue and
succession: for his issue male ending in
females, and gouerning this Scepter
with great glorie and magnificence, for
the space of a fullage, it pleased God so
to dispose in his prouidence, that this
wise King being to place his two daughters
in mariage, the one into Scotland,
the other into France; and question being
made by some of his Counsell where
the eldest should bee bestowed? his answere

was, that hee had rather bring
Scotland into England, then carrie England
into France: as it were foreseeing
in his wisdome (like a Propheticall spirit)
the meanes and occasions whereby
these Kingdomes might happilie be vnited;
and God blessed the successe accordingly.
For whereas since that time, by
all likelihoode and probabilitie, this
Kingdome should haue beene vnited,
sometimes to Spaine, sometimes to
France, and once, by an intended mariage
to Scotland, though otherwise so
backt with violence and force, as being
more vnnaturall, was therefore lesse acceptable
to God: but God, who had appointed
the vniting of these kingdomes,
had likewise appointed the meanes; lest
the greater should seeme to conte
                  •
               ne
the lesse, therefore the lesser kingdome
should containe in it selfe the right of inheritance
to the greater. And thus this
good King being inferior to none, either
for valour, (for so hee attained his

Crowne▪ or for wisdome, being trained
vp in the schoole of Lewis the eleuenth,
hauing tasted both fortunes, made wise
by experience; or for his iustice and pietie,
leauing behinde him full coffers, and
a plentifull treasure, hee died: for what
should we expect but all happie successe
from the Sonne of such a vertuous, such
a godly, and most religious Mother, as
was the Lady Margaret Countesse of Richmonde?
            
            Now (in these our daies) wee see the
full accomplishing of all those blessings,
which were then onely in hope and expectation.
For in the person of our most
gracious King, besides all the blessings
which were contained in Henry, wee see
the perfect vniting of these kingdomes:
God forbid that I should any way paralell,
or make comparison betweene the
Graund-childe and his forefathers, this
were fitter to bee done betweene strangers;
yet sure I am, that not in any one
propertie our Soueraigne comes short

of his Progenitors. For being to vnite
two seuerall Kingdomes, it pleased God
to giue him a disposition accordingly,
such an open and louing heart generally
to all (as being to gouerne people of
diuers nations), that for the truth of his
loue and affection▪ the whole World, or
at least this whole Iland might not improperly
seeme to bee his natiue soyle;
such a bountifull and magnificent mind,
(as hauing many kingdomes to be the
obiects of his bountie), that infinite and
nūberlesse they are, who haue found the
sweete benefit of his beneuolence, either
for profit or honour, or both; besides
his wisdome and learning, wherein by
many degrees hee hath surpassed all his
Progenitors; his gouernement being agreeable
to his nature, so milde, so temperate,
that it seemes to be paternall, as
if Iacob were now amongst his sonnes, and
had the promised land in possession. In so
much, that since his Maiesties most happie
ariuall to this kingdome, there hath

followed such a generall Peace, as that
for such a time wee neuer enioyed the
like: for here amongst our selues, not any
one of our Nobilitie hath suffered
death; the subiects in generall haue enioyed
such a free course of iustice, and
such a secure time, that had it not beene
for the monster of our age, the most
horrible treason that euer was inuented
(the Gun-powder plot), assuredly we
should haue much doubted, whether it
were possible for the minde of man to
hatch any treason, against so louing, so
gracious, and such a mercifull Prince.
And in regard that this kingdome hath
alwaies swaied a great part of Christendome,
and hath giuen lawes vnto others,
&amp;c. it hath pleased God, that since
his Maiesties comming to the Crowne,
many bloodie warres haue been app
                  •••
               sed
by his most gracious mediation; and
notwithstanding that the occasions did
often appeare, which did seeme to threaten
blood-shed and warre, yet God in

his mercy hath so preuented it, as that
there was neuer conceiued such a generall
expectation of an vniuersall Peace to
ensue.
            And whereas not any Nation vnder
the Sunne, hath heretofore so farre preuailed
ouer this Iland, as the Danes; by
his Maiesties most happie Marriage,
wee are now secured from all feare, and
seeme to bee much strengthened by the
alliance of a most stoute and warlike
people; in so much that both for the entire
loue, and brotherly affection to your
Maiestie, as likewise for the great honour
of this Kingdome, wee haue twice
seene, to our great ioy and comfort,
The most valiant and couragious Prince,
The high and mightie Christian the fourth,
King of Denmarke and Norwey; first riding
thorough our streetes in triumph,
(but in a peaceable triumph) since priuilie
and vnexpectiuely surprising your
Maiesties person, (for the truth of loue
cannot alwaies stay the leisure to bee attended

on with ceremonies). And thus
God to shew the perpetuall league and
couenant made with vs, hath so happilie
contriued, that the meanes for our
perpetuall peace, might be for euer continued;
that Nation, which heretofore
hath been at our backs to pursue vs, now
stand like sure friends to backe and to
ayde vs.
            For our most noble Prince Charles,
considering that the continuance of our
happinesse depends vpon his hope and
expectation, I will forbeare to speake;
onely thus much I may say, that being
descended from such noble Progenitors,
as he partakes their nature, so their
vertues, carrying a name, which hath
beene most fortunate to the Christian
world, his naturall disposition and education
being such, as seemes to promise
the enlarging of our happinesse; My
prayers shall be, that of this fruite, wee may
receiue fruite, and that from his lo
                     •
                  nes these
kingdomes may bee for euer established and

knit together, as long as the Sunne and the
Moone shall endure.
            
            To returne to your Maiestie, to whom
I doe owe my particular seruice: howsoeuer
your Maiestie is no way desirous
to heare your owne due praise and commendation,
chusing rather to practise,
then publish your vertues; yet I can
doe no lesse then acknowledge with
great ioyfulnesse of minde, with great
thankefulnesse to God, the many blessings
wherewith it hath pleased God to
adorne your Maiestie. For what can
bee required in a Princesse, which God
hath no
                  •
                most plentifullie and in a full
measure imparted to your Maiestie,
so royallie and noblie descended, so
religious and deuoute in Gods seruice,
hauing such excellent gifts of nature
for your wisdome and vnderstanding,
and being euery way and in euery kinde
most vertuous in your selfe; your Maiestie
did neuer fauour any, but those
that were trulie vertuous, and alwaies

haue fauoured those most, who were
indeede most vertuous; in so much that
being most free from all affectation
of popularitie (which sometimes proceedes
not from the best grounds), yet
your Maiestie hath alwaies been most
highly honoured, as generallie of all, so
especiallie of those who are truely vertuous;
for your bountie, charitie, and
magnificēce, which appeare, as to all vpō
occasions, so more particularlie in helping
relieuing▪ giuing large and yeerely
pensions to the seruants of the late most
noble Prince Henry: for your iustice,
equitie, &amp;c. not any Princesse in the
world did euer loue iustice more truely
and entirely then your Maiestie doth,
taking onelie the protection of iust
causes: insomuch that whereas many
thousands are bound dailie to pray
for your Maiestie; yet I may boldlie
speake it, that the corruption of
mans minde could neuer frame vnto
it selfe, the lest seeming or supposed occasion

of complaint or grieuance.
            These blessings being such and so
great, I could doe no lesse then remember
them to Gods glorie, your Maiesties
honour, and to our great comfort,
beseeching God to continue them, daily
to inlarge them, and to make vs thankefull
for them; and here I doe most humblie
desire your Maiestie to pardon my
boldnesse, in presenting these my vnworthie
labours, and together with
them my selfe, and all my endeuours to
your most gracious seruice and protection;
most earnestly beseeching your
Maiestie to accept of them, though I
doe truely and from my heart acknowledge,
that they are all, most vnworthie
of your acceptation; yet in recompence
thereof, I will humbly beseech God in
my dailie prayers, to blesse and preserue
the Kings Highnesse, your Maiestie, our
noble Prince Charles, the Prince and
Princesse Palatine, with their issue, together
with that most royall stocke and familie,

from whence your Maiestie is descended▪
that God in his mercie would
giue vnto you all the blessings of nature
abundantlie, the present earnest of
his grace, and the future possession
of his
glory.

            To the Reader.
            
               CHristian Reader, there is nothing
which I can so fitly recommend
to thy dailie and
continuall thoughts, as is the
meditation of Gods eternall
prouidence: how God (many infinite ages before
the foundations of the earth were laid)
hath so ordained the course of this world, that
according to his owne iust appointment, all
things might succeed, and fall out in their due
times and seasons, either for the manifestation
of his 
                  〈◊〉
               , or iustice▪ and this prouidence
not including a
                  •
               one the great necessary,
and naturall causes for the preseruation of
this vniuerse (suppose the motion and course
of the heauens, the preseruation of elements,
and the 
                  •
               ike), but also to comprehend the voluntarie
and free actions of man; so that God

working in man works according to the condition
of mans nature, the freedom of mans will
subsisting with the ouer-ruling hand of Gods
prouidēce (for thus the causes are subordinated),
and God working in nature, doth no
way destroy his owne workes and that excellent
order, which he himselfe hath appointed
from the beginning.
            This prouidence doth not onely extend it
selfe to the great and most noble actions of
man (suppose the gouernment of kingdoms, &amp;
Empires, and whatsoeuer else may concerne
the life and saluation of man), but it descends
much lower, and as it cōprehends the care and
protection of dumbe beasts, so it stoopes euen
to the meanest and basest action of man, as the
falling downe of his haire, &amp;c. for wheresoeuer
God begins the action, and makes a creature
of nothing, there the same God with his preuenting
and subsequent prouidence, must continue
his own worke; for if it be left to it self,
it will againe returne vnto nothing.
            For euery man daily to consider, how God
hath dealt with him in his prouidence, I suppose

it is a most Christian and godly meditation,
free from all superstitious vanitie, such
as I doe greatly recommend to thy practise,
such as I my selfe (sinfull and wretched man
that I am) haue cōtinually found in the who
                  •
               e
course of my life; what neither blind fortune,
nor the trickes and subtilties of wit, nor the
power and strength of man, could euer haue
compassed, I haue found that God in his prouidence
hath freely wrought and effected. To
let passe all other things which are proper and
priuate to my selfe (if thou pleasest to peruse
this hom
                  •
               ly Pamphlet), I thinke it not vnfit
to acquaint thee with this one accident.
            When first I made choice of my text, I had
thought to haue finished it within the compasse
of one houre, and hauing waded into it,
(supposing it to be a subiect which did well
deserue my labours), God did so dispose of it,
that this whole treatise doth onely containe
the first part or branch of the text. Secondly,
hauing gathered some obscure and straggling
notes for mine owne priuate vse, whe
                  ••
               as I
may boldly say, that no man did euer more

abhorre the Presse then my selfe; solemnly
protesting that I would sooner bee rackt or
prest to death for silence, rather thē any w
                  •
               rds
of mine should once hinder the Presse▪ wishing
from my heart, that there might be some
generall vacation, that new bookes might for
a time cease, that wee might finde at length
some leisure to peruse, reuiew, and reprint the
old Fathers; not contenting our selues with
patcht peeces, and broken sentences, but that
they might be heard ingeniously to speake for
themselues. For as we doe recommend the reading
of Scriptures, so let vs not neglect the
best Commentaries and Expositions of Scriptures,
that so the heate of our zeale, which
now is wholy wasted in controuersies and oppositions,
might then be spent in the practise
of pietie and deuotion, &amp;c. Notwithstanding
this my resolution, yet I was easily moued
(and the rather because I doe not remember
any booke written of this Subiect) to publish
this treatise.
            I
                  •
                perusing whereof foure things there
are, wherewith I thinke fit to acquaint thee:

first, though (I confesse) I haue herein made
vse of other mens workes, yet I did forbeare
to set downe any quotations, not that I desire
to wrong them, but that I think it vnfit, when
occasion did not moue me, or necessitie inforce
me, there to vse many needlesse and idle quotations.
Secondly, though the punishment and
fall of man appeares chiefly and principally in
respect of his preparation to grace; yet my
selfe supposing at this time, that I speake only
to the naturall man, I thought fit to forbeare
speaking of that subiect, vntill first I should
make it appeare, that there is a sanctifying
grace, which is no way tyed or intailed to our
nature, which I haue reserued as a fit subiect
to bee treated of in the third branch of my
text. Thirdly, in the latter end of the second
part, speaking of the vanitie of the creatures,
if therein according to the condition of that
subiect, I shall somtimes intend (though much
against mine owne naturall disposition) in
this my long tedious discourse, to giue thee
some case and recreation, I hope it shall proue
no way offensiue, no not against the seuerest

and strictest discipline of the Church; seeing I
can therein iustifie my selfe, by the practise
and president of most deuout Fathers, and
others most reuerend Diuines in all ages.
Fourthly, speaking there of many worldly vanities,
my intent is, onely to discouer them to
be but shadowes, in respect of a true blisse, that
so euery man might fall into some dislike with
himselfe; yet (I confesse) that many things
may, and ought still to be continued, considering
the state and condition wherein we liue,
as namely the ceremonies of Honor, &amp;c.
            My desire is, that thou wouldest iudge of
the whole, by the whole; of the parts, by the
parts: for if the whole be taken together, I
hope I shall not be found wanting or defectiue
to my intended scope. If sometimes I prooue
somewhat obscure, God (who knowes the secrets
of my heart) can beare me witnesse, how
free I am from the least affectation of obscuritie;
and therefore you must either blame my
weakenes, as not conceiuing things aright, or
not able sufficiently to expresse mine own conceits:
or else you must consider the subiect

matter whereof I write, which being very
difficult in it selfe, must necessarily admit
words of Art to vnfold it. To conclude, I
thought fit to continue this treatise, in the
same forme wherein it was first framed, expecting
that the God of truth should giue a
gr
                  ••
               ter blessing to the relation of a truth; neither
would my time or leisure permit me to alter
it. And if it shall please God, that this
booke finde happie successe, so that some little
good may thereby redound vnto Gods
Church, whereby I shall be the more incouraged
to proceede in those parts which yet remaine;
though I purpose to giue full satisfaction
(as farre foorth as it lies in my power),
yet if possibly I can, I will tye my selfe to the
houre-glasse: ingeniously confessing, that as all
other builders are commonly mistaken in their
first workes, so my sel
                  •
               e haue erred in laying
the foundations, or setting vp the porch of
this building.
            Thus being men of the same kind, brethren
descended from one stocke, but especially as
fellow-members incorporated into one body,

vnder one misticall head Christ Iesus, in the
most holy communion of his Saints, well wishing
and praying for each other, I doe most
humbly and earnestly beseech God, that
either thou maist receiue some smal profit
by my labours, or that thou maist bestow
thine own labours elsewhere more
profitably: and so committing thee
to his grace, prouidence and
protection, I rest.

               , 
                  •
               here is
that transient propertie of God, whereby all the rest of
his attributes are imparted to the creatures: and when
I consider this streame of mercie, not to be inclosed

within the narrow passage of a few tribes, not to be appropriated
or monopolized to the sonnes of Iacob; but
to ouerflow the bankes, to breake downe the partition
wall, together with the vaile of the Temple, and at
length, at length, at length to be-water the fruitlesse and
barren soiles of the Gentiles; so that with God there
should be no longer any difference or acceptation of
persons, but together with the Sunne-shine and dew of
the heauens, his mercie should drop downe with fatnesse;
here is the sure anchor of my hope, the fulnesse
and consummation of my ioy: And therefore the day
of Epiphanie, of all other daies in the yeere, shall be the
day of my greatest mirth and solemnitie; wherein those
great Magi, those Princes and Kings being publike
persons, representing the whole bodie and state of the
Gentiles, presented themselues, and were accepted of
Christ; and we in their loines, descended from them, together
with them receiued the lot and portion of our
inheritance: Iaphet is now admitted to the tents and
tabernacles of Shem; heere is the kingdome of Shilo,
which admits no other limits or bounds of his empire,
then the compasse and circumference of the whole
world; blessed are the feete of them, which brought vs

            I haue no sooner ended my song,The feare of a relapse. but me thinkes I
am fallen into a cold sweare, and am suddenly stroken

with great feare and confusion, as indeed this world,
subsisting betweene Heauen and Hell, partakes the nature
of both; the extreames, and allaies; the excessiue
ioyes of the one, with the feares and terrors of the other,
making a strange mixture betweene hope and
feare: for when I obserue the course of things, the seuerall
actions and inclinations of men; when I consider
the diseases of these times, together with all the
signes, tokens, and symptomes: alas, alas, I feare a relapse,
I feare a relapse, lest the world in her old doting
age, should now againe turne infidell, and that the end
of vs be worse then the beginning. The sicke patient
indeed will not confesse her disease: but this doth not
acquit her, rather it makes her state more dangerous:
neuer so much boasting of faith, as there is at this day;
for to many it serues as a soueraigne medicine, an excellent
antidote, to exclude the necessitie of good
workes: or if any one should professe open heathenisme
and infidelitie, what reward should hee haue of
his follie?
            But when I consider,The grounds of this feare. that nothing is of such difficultie,
as to induce faith, and to perswade man, beyond the
course and streame of his owne nature, to beleeue the
mysteries of religion; considering mans naturall infidelitle
and distrust, the infinite windings and turnings of
his mind, to lay hold on it, to imprison it, and to chaine
it to the pillar of faith; considering (I say) that all the
markes and tokens of infidelitie doe sufficiently discouer
themselues; a generall want of zeale and deuotion;
a great neglect of all Christian mortification and discipline;
the ouerflowing and ripenesse of s
                  •
               nne in this
last age of the world; and certaine it is, that in euery
sinn
                  •
               , there is a mixture of infidelitie, auersio à De
                     •
                  , and
of Idolatrie,

                     •
                  aturus, the greater the sin,
the more is the infidelitie: for would ye count him an

Infidell or Idolater, that offers vp but two graines of
incense to an Idol? 
                  •
               nd will ye suppose him to be lesse,
who offers and spends his whole life, and consecrates
himselfe to the worship, seruice, and the immoderate
vse of the creatures, without any thought or reference
to the Creator? Considering again the nature and efficacie
of faith: for if the vnderstanding be sufficiently
informed, and throughly resolued, the will must necessarily
follow her directions; and to their rule and gouernmental
our outward actions must be squared out,
and measured accordingly: for euery tree is knowne
by his fruits, and euery thing according to the inward
existence, so hath it an outward operation: if our hearts
were inligh
                  •
               ned, they could not produce such workes
of darknesse; if the fire were kindled, it could not bee
accompanied with such coldnes of charitie. And therfore
I pray' pardon me, if I haue not so much faith, as to
beleeue the faith of many, that make an open profession
of faith; or at least giue me leaue, as in all actions
and policies of state, so in religion, sometimes to suspect
and preuent the worst: and therefore while others
labour in repairing the walles, some in erecting
and couering the roofe, some in beautifying and adorning
the Temple, giue me leaue to search the foundation,
which though it 
                  ••
               and vpon a Rocke, Christ Iesus
being the head corner stone of the building, against
whom neither storme nor tempest, no not the powers
of hell can preuaile; yet if I shall in some sort discouer
the strength of this building, we our selues may better
secure our selues in the certaintie and infallibilitie of
our faith; the deepe and sure foundation will keepe vs
from wauering, and it may likewise serue to preuent
the assaults and attempts of the heathen. Herein I shall
follow the practise of wise husbandmen, who sometimes
digge and lay naked the roote, that so the tree

may fructifie, and bring foorth fruite in greater abundance.
            Especially for the honour of our progenitors, to iustifie
the proceedings of those great Magi,The Magi. together
with the iust motiues and grounds of their happie conuersion,
I wil follow their steps, runne the same course,
and take the same pilgrimage with them guided by a
starre, the light of reason, the contemplation of nature.
I will direct my course to Ierusalem, the place of
Gods worship; where the law of God, which giues the
best testimonie of God, is kept in safe custodie; there
I will make a great outcrie, a solemne proclamation,
Vbiest, quinatus estrex Iudaeorum: then after due search
of the Law and the Prophets, I will hasten to Bethelem,
where I will adore God in the manger, the Sonne
of God in a cradle.
            Thus in this great world you may obserue, that first
there was a state of nature, which was the forerunner
to the Law: then followed the Law, which was a preparatiue
to the Gospell: now at length succeeds the
Gospell, wherein there is the fulnesse of knowledge, as
much as is befitting our nature and present condition:
if an Angell from heauen shall teach any other way,
let him be accursed: and yet we may expect some further
reuelation of the mysteries of Christs kingdome,
when wee our selues shall be more capable thereof,
which shall be in the state of happinesse and glorie.
            Thus vndertaking to search the ground-worke of
religion, I will claime vnto my selfe these two priuiledges:
First, in the foundation no man sets iewels or
pretious stones; rubbish or vnhewen stone will suffice,
when wee looke only to the strength of the building:
If I could vse many quotations of Fathers,
Councels, Canons, Schoolemen, or humane learning,
I would forbeare to doe it, these shall serue to polish

and beautifie the Temple: but I will neuer admit them
to the ground-worke, left in stead of props, they might
seeme to vndermine and weaken the foundation, if religion
should relie vpon such incertainties.
            Secondly, in laying the foundation, no man is ouer
curious in the workmanship; caruing and cutting
may well be spared, when we regard only the strength
of the building: Pardon me if my stile be vulgar, and
that I doe not obserue a right methode; for I will take
vnto my selfe this libertie, and in liew thereof I will
only intend demonstratiue proofe.
            I will bee more sparing in alleaging Scripture,
though it be authenticall and sufficient in it selfe: yet
here I will not expose it to the battell, for I am to deale
with the heathen, her seruants and handmaides. Reason
and common sense shall stand in the forefront,Naturall reason shall be our guid
                     •
                  
                and
beare the whole brunt of the combat. Arts and Sciences
they doe not proue their owne principles, but as
they are linckt together in a golden chaine, so they do
mutually and reciprocally performe this dutie to each
other, especially the Metaphisicks, which as a superintendent
takes no particular charge, but visits her whole
prouince; confirmes the principles of Arts; appoints
their circuits and bounds, and giues them their due approbation.
Such is the force and efficacie of truth, that
wheresoeuer or howsoeuer disposed, still she carries
the same stampe, and stands alike affected to the maintenance
of her selfe, and is alwaies readie prest either
to fight, or to bee deposed, in defence of her owne
right.
            Since man, according to his condition, is naturally
lead by sense, for want of a better guide, I will take vpon
me to conduct him, from sensible obiects by the
light of his owne reason, to the knowledge of things
spirituall: and to this end I haue made choice of this

text; The naturall man cannot comprehend the things of
the spirit of God.
               The intent of the author. Wherein I will shew first the insufficiencie
of nature, in attaining the least part of this heauenly
knowledge. Secondly, how nature may rest satisfied,
contented, and yeeld her assent to the mysteries
of faith, notwithstanding her owne ignorance:
this shall be the scope and intent of my speech.
            But how shall I (that am a naturall man) presume to
approch, vnlesse I be guided by Gods spirit? Now the
meanes to obtaine this spirit is inuocation and prayer:
Prayer, which is a naturall sacrifice, taught vs by a naturall
instinct, and serues as a preparatiue to grace, nature
supporting grace, tending and directed to grace:
the vessell and instrument of grace, hath first ingrafted
in vs preparatiue and disposing qualities to grace. He
that seasoneth and sanctifieth nature, powre downe his
grace, and touch my tongue with a coale from his altar:
he that plaies the sweete musicke, first tune the instrument;
let vs draw nigh vnto God, and he will draw
nigh vnto vs.
            
               Blessed Lord God, &amp;c.
               IT hath been a long obiection of many wordlings
and Atheists,A generall obiection. who conforming themselues to the
loose condition of these times, seeke by all possible
meanes to weaken the grounds and foundations of
our Christian faith; that religion seemes too much to
inforce the reason and vnderstanding of man; that
whereas by nature we haue some inward instinct, some
inbred principles and seedes of knowledge, frō whence
the reasonable and discoursiue soule drawes her certaine
conclusions, for our guide and direction here in
the course of this life; yet religion, especially Christian

religion, seemes wilfully to oppose it selfe against the
current and streame of mans nature; it propounds precepts
and rules of practise, contrary to mans owne inclination;
mysteries of faith, ouerthrowing the grounds
of reason; hope beyond all coniecture and probabilitie:
as if man could conspire against himselfe, or that
the testimonie of the whole world could preuaile against
the cabinet-counsel and knowledge of his own
soule; as if that God which reueales the mysteries of
grace, were not the same God which first laid the foundations
of nature. To whom shal a man giue credit and
trust, if the inward light of his owne soule shall serue as
a meanes to delude him? vse the best motiues and perswasions,
yet still the Schoole holds, that Iudicium vltimum
practici intellectus determinat voluntatem: Man,
according to the measure of his own knowledge, giues
his assent or dissent; to be credulous and easie of beleefe,
is no token of the greatest wisedome.
               If reason should be altogether silenced in the points
of our faith, thē God should moue mā not answerable
to his state and condition, but as a stocke, or as a stone,
not any way concurring, no labourer, or fellow wo
                     •
                  kman
in the action. Take away the groundwork of reason
and discourse, we shall neuer be able to put a difference
between the infusions of grace, and the delusions
of error, but all must be admitted alike: for signes, miracles
and prophecies haue ceased, which were wont to
be the seales for the confirmation of the truth: now to
admit this, were to leade the vnderstanding captiue, a
thing farre more detestable, then was the slauerie and
bondage of Egypt.

could not altogether excuse them; for then I should
vpbraid God, with his owne workmanship; how shall
the vessell say vnto the Potter, why madest thou mee
thus? yet certainly their case would seeme much more
fauourable, to the eares of an indifferent man; and
for my selfe, I would humbly surcease my duty &amp; calling,
and desire God to vse the ministery of Angels,
for the conuersion of man; for flesh and blood cannot
preuaile against the naturall inclination of flesh and
blood: nothing can struggle or striue against nature,
the current and streame is so violent: for nature is the
foundation, whereupon wee must build: now if the
walles, or the roofe seeme ouer great, or ouerthwart to
the foundation, no maruell if the whole building fall
to decay. The Philosopher will testifie as much: Natura
intus delitescens prohibet alienum: bee the water
neuer so scalding hot, yet will it returne to her first and
naturall coldnesse. The Poet wil say as much in effect:
Naturam expellas furc
                        •
                     , licet vsque recurret: set the
naturall man vpon the racke, yet is it impossible that
euer he should beleeue any thing contrary to the light
of his owne reason: this is a naturall inclination of nature
to her selfe, and it is no way contradicted in
Scripture; for the naturall law, the Ceremoniall law,
and the Iudiciall law might together subsist; and at
this time the Morall law, imprinted in mans owne
heart, is no way abolished: now as is the will of man
inclined to our actions, so is our vnderstandings disposed
to our faith, both of them defectiue, and neither of
them opposite; and therefore the Apostle doth heere
place spirituall things much aboue nature, farre transcending
nature, beyond the Sphere of nature, but no
way contrary or opposite to nature.
               Thus by the grace of God it shall well appeare, that
reason, and mans naturall vnderstanding, are so farre

from ouerthrowing the principles of Christian religion,
as that they seeme rather greatly to confirme and
strengthen them.A generall Answere. See here the goodnesse of God;
though God needs not the testimonie of man, the Sun
at noone day needs not to bee discouered by the light
of a candle; yet for mans owne satisfaction and contentment,
hee requires the witnesse and testimonie of
man: Tabernaculum posuit in sole, legem in corde: truth
is not repugnant to truth; nature supports grace; and
as both of them proceed from one fountaine, so the
same God, who is the author of both, will not destroy
his owne workes: Sed agit secundum modum vnius cuiusque
naturae: If God requires faith in the vnderstanding,
conformity in the will; then vndoubtedly the
same God hath first infused in them an inclination to
both. Compare the vnderstanding to the eye: suppose
you were to apply some medicine, some plaister or
salue; at the first indeed it seemes to put out the sight,
but at length it purgeth and cleanseth the eye: naturall
reason (I confesse) of it selfe is defectiue, and cannot
apprehend the mysteries of faith; but being once cured
and enlightened by faith, sanctified by grace, it
serues to confirme and strengthen the grounds and
principles of faith; and therefore our Diuines suppose
reason to haue the same reference to faith, which sometimes
leauen had to the sacrifices of the Law; and indeed
Scripture signifieth, one by the other: Beware of
the leauen of the Pharisees, Matth. 18. that is to say, as
the Interpretors expound; beware of the humane wisdome
and subtiltie of the Pharisees. Now leauen it was
excluded from the sacrifices, Leuit. 2. And in the seuenth
of Leuit, it was commanded, that the sacrifices
should bee laid and offered vp vpon leauened bread:
Super f
                        •
                     rmentatos panes: the intent of the law-giuer
was, that leauen should be no part of the sacrifice, and

yet no sacrifice to be performed without leauen: reason,
or humane knowledge must not enter into, or
comprehend the mysteries of faith; and yet the mysteries
of faith must necessarily presuppose the ground-worke
and foundation of reason: Principia religionis
sunt nobis innata: reason informes man, that the end of
mans creation consists not in man himselfe, who vndoubtedly
shall tast and see corruption, but in the glory
and seruice of his maker; to him there is due, not
onely the subiection of the body, with humility and
reuerence; but likewise the obedience of the soule; the
will denying it selfe, and made conformable to Gods
law; the vnderstanding acknowledging his own blindnesse,
prostrating it selfe to the light and information
of faith; there must be a totall and absolute subiection,
befitting the infinite and absolute Empire of the diuine
Maiesty: and hence it is that neither the vegetatiue,
nor the sensitiue, but onely the reasonable creature is
made capable of religion: and hence it is that the inuisible
God, appearing by the visible creatures, the vnbeleeuing
man is made vnexcusable.
               That I might herein giue all men some contentment
and satisfaction,The generall diuision of the Text. as farre forth as it lies in my power,
I haue made choyce of this text; wherein I will
consider the two extremities; 1. the naturall man;
2. the things of the spirit of God; and then 3. the
disproportion which consists, as in dignity, power, eternity,
and all other the diuine attributes: Finiti ad infinitum
nulla est ratio seu proportio: so likewise in knowledge,
non percipit, hee cannot conceiue the things of
the spirit of God: that I may deale with him vpon equall
tearmes, that no aduantage, or iust exception
should be taken; I doe heere protest, that I will vse no
other weapons to conuince this naturall man, but only
the light of his owne naturall reason: I will lay aside

Scripture, Fathers, Councels, the vniforme and Catholicke
consent of the whole world: I doe onely appeale
to himselfe, and to his owne knowledge. I stand vpon
the goodnesse and equitie of my cause; and therefore
I doe not feare to make him, that is the aduerse partie
in the suite, the iudge of my cause.
               Thus farre indeed I must excuse my selfe; I can doe
no lesse then sometimes vse the phrase of Scripture,
considering my profession, my habite, bred &amp; brought
vp in the Schooles of the Prophets; speaking to a Christian
Auditorie, in a religious time, and place. Againe,
sometimes you must giue me leaue to suppose that for
a truth, which afterward I will bring to the touchstone;
for all cannot be proued in an instant. Haue patience,
and forbeare mee a while, and I doe heere promise,
that if my whole and entire speech shall bee duly
examined, the burthen and waight of my arguments
shall onely relie vpon naturall reason.
               In the first part of my text, concerning the naturall
man,A more particular diuision of the Text. I will speake of these three things: first, that by
the light of nature we doe discerne, and acknowledge
the corruption of nature. Secondly, that by the light
of nature we are sufficiently instructed, that nature is
no competent guide, to conduct vs to a supernaturall
end. Thirdly, that nature being thus defectiue, there is
some higher stare and condition, whereunto being
once admitted, wee may bee directed to happinesse. So
in the first part, in the naturall man, I will consider nature
corrupted, nature defectiue and imperfect, nature
supplied by grace. Secondly, in the other extremitie I
will consider, first, how farre the naturall man may
wade into the knowledge of the Deity. Secondly,
what is exempted from his knowledge, and wherunto
he must not approch, videlicet, to the things of the spirit
of God. Thirdly, in the disproportion consisting in

knowledge, I will first consider the reason why these
things are concealed from reason. Secondly, how man
shall satisfie the curiosity of his owne minde, notwithstanding
his owne ignorance, in the humble submission
of his owne soule, together with a sufficient warrant
for our faith, and security.
               I shall not here neede to describe the naturall man;
for it is not vnknowne vnto you, that God▪
                  Who is the Naturall man. by vertue
of his promise, to preserue and continew the same excellent
order, which was first instituted in the creation,
hath tied himselfe to impart some things vnto the
creatures, as necessary and essential to the being, without
which the creature cannot subsist; other things are
added, as onely accessary to the nature, and these depend
vpon the free-will, and choyce of the giuer.
Hence it is that there are seuerall kindes; and sorts of
creatures; and to euery kinde, there are seueral and peculiar
properties allotted; 
                     〈…〉
                   betweene the
vegetatiue, 
                     〈◊〉
                   and the reasonable creature: so
of reasonable creatures, some haue onely an instinct of
nature, a reasonable and discoursiue 
                     •
                  oule, wherein the
principles of humane knowledge are ingrafted: others,
besides this little sparke of reason, are further enlightened,
by the assistance of Gods spirit, as children
taught by their Schoole-master. Now conceiue man
onely consisting of nature, without hope of happines,
or any further direction of grace (such as were the
morall Heathen, the vncircumcised Gentiles) which
stare and condition euery man claimes, by vertue of his
first birth; and here you haue the naturall man described.
Now that there should bee such a difference betweene
man, and man; that grace should be distinguished
from nature, I wil not here insist vpon the proofe:

for by Gods helpe it shall easily appeare, by the sequell
of my speech.
               It cannot be denied, but nature in generall is much
corrupted; which doth more argue the corruption of
māin particular, being that whole nature is directed to
man. First it appeares, in that shee is more plentifull,
and abounding in euill, then in good: Vna est recta linea,
curuae infinitae: there is but one straight and direct
passage,More euill then good. but there are many infinite by-waies, and
pathes: there is but one truth, answerable to that eternall
truth, which is but one, and one alone, aboue
the Sphere of the creatures: but there are diuers and
infinite falshoods: there is but one state of a sound and
whole constitution; but diseases, and distempers are
numberlesse: to euery vertue, there are many vices opposed;
to euery meane, there are many extreames. If
nature were indifferent, and indifferently affected,
as well to the one, as to the other; then might wee
claime (according to the course and rule of iustice) an
equall ballance. Suppose with the Maniches, that there
were two distinct principles, one of good, another of
euill; yet both of them should be alike bounded in power,
and should share alike in their actions; for otherwise,
in time, the one would deuoure and extinguish
the other: but considering that there is onely one
fountaine, from whence whole nature proceeds; and
that the fountaine onely of good, without any mixture
of euill: certainly this malignitie of nature, proceeds
not from her first institution, but from some after
accidentall corruption.
               Secondly, if many snares were laid to intrap vs, and
many euils, counterfait and disguised in the habite of
goodnesse,Nature more inclines vnto euill, then vnto good. should assault vs; it would then stand with
the prouidence and perfection of nature, that if shee
could not vtterly abolish them, yet to frustrate their attempts,

to decline from those euils, and to make the
creatures more warie, and cautionate: but it falles out
farre otherwise, cleane contrarie; whereas being placed
betweene generation, and corruption, shee should
equally partake of both, according to rule, measure, &amp;
proportion; obserue the disparitie, there is but one
way of production, one manner of birth, a framing
and fashioning in the wombe; but there are infinite
by-waies, which leade to destruction and ruine; fire,
water, sword, famine, diuers and seuerall mischances:
many moneths are required for the constitution of a
body, but in an instant it is suddenly dissolued. Suppose
that any part of man were rotted, or consumed;
this part, vnles incision be made, will vndoubtedly corrupt
the whole body: but why should not the whole
body, being greater in quantity, indued with that
actiue and soueraigne quality of heate, rather endeauour
and striue to regaine this one corrupted member,
and to restore it to perfection? One man infected with
the plague, is able to inflame the whole City: why
should not the whole City rather, being perfect and
sound, recall this one infected member? One beast
tainted with the murren, destroyes the whole flocke;
and all creatures finde it a rule in their actions, that, Facilius
est destruere, quàm componere; it is easier to pull
downe, then to build; it is easier to deface, then to
perfect. See here, nature discouers her selfe, or at least
seemes to complaine of her owne wants: shee is corrupted,
she is corrupted; and therefore no longer to be
held as a louing mother, or as an indifferent iudge; but
to be accounted as a partiall step-dame, wholly tending
and enclining to corruption.
               Thirdly,The Heauens against the Elements. to descend more particularly to the seuerall
parts of nature; the heauens, and the earth, seeme to
conspire the one against the other: for the greatest part

of the yeere) these inferiour bodies seeme to be frozen,
and congealed with coldnesse in the Sunnes absence;
or else to be scorched and consumed with heate, by his
ill neighbourhood, and nearer accesse: the least part of
the yeere is temperate; as likewise the least part of the
earth is temperate and habitable, either in regard of the
climate, or in regard of the soyle; barren heathes, high
mountaines, stonie
                     •
                  ockes, wast desarts and wildernes:
I speake not of the huge Ocean, which with her armes
seemes to imbrace the whole earth▪ and farre to exceed
it in quantity: but I pra'y, what might cause the vnseasonable
weather; excessiue drought in the spring, excessiue
moysture in haruest; the spring alwaies annoyed
with an East winde, which nippes the tender 
                     •
                  ud;
and the Autumne alwaies molested with a 
                     〈◊〉
                  
Westerne winde, which scattereth the 
                     〈◊〉
                   before
they are ripened? it should seeme, that in the beginning
God did square and proportion the heauens for
the earth, vsing his rule, leauell, and compasse; the earth
as the center, the heauens for the circumference; the
earth as an immoueable stocke, still obserues the sa
                     ••
                  
distance, the same scituation and place. Whence 
                     •
                  omes
the diuersitie, the stormes, and the tempests, the famine,
the pestilence, and the like? can Magistrates and Rulers
conspire to ouerthrow the State? can Princes commit
a treasonable act? or is there opposition, and factions
in heauen, as well as in earth, amongst those simple
and pure bodies, consisting of the same quin
                     •
                  essence
and nature, and therefore in reason should not admit
contrariety in their actions? The Starres in generall intend
the earths fruitfulnesse; each one in particular
hath his seuerall office and dutie: if vertue be added to
vertue, and their influence together concurre, it should
rather further and perfect the action; certainly some
ouer-ruling hand and prouidence stirres vp these vprores,

and thereby intimates the reciprocal opposition,
as of the earth to the heauens, so of the heauens to the
earth; but the root of this dissention first bred, and is
still fastened in the earth, from whence proceeds the
first occasion of these tumults.
               Fourthly, I will leaue the heauens, and come to these
lower regions; for we are fallen, we are fallen, from the
heauens to the earth,The elements against themselues. and heere I will take a suruey of
nature: What is it that preserues natur
                     •
                   in the same
state, wherein she consists▪ the Philosopher will tell
you: Discors elementorum concordia: is it possible
that a well ordered, and a well gouerned state, should
onely be vpheld and maintained with banding and factions?
this seemes to detract from the prouidence; for
it stands with the condition of creatures to bee finite,
and to receiue bounds and limitations, as in their nature,
so in their actions, and qualities; neither can it
stand with wisedome or iustice, that creatures should
thus trespasse vpon creatures, and offend each other,
without any sufficient vmpire, or indifferent iudge to
take vp the controuersie. Shall I tell you the reason?
Man, who was principally ordained for Gods seruice,
as all other creatures for man; man (I say) breaking
his owne bounds, being nexus &amp; naturae vinculum, it
must necessarily follow, that all the rest of the creatures,
which were bound and knit together in man, should
likewise be inordinate, &amp; ouerflow their owne banks:
if the Captaine and guide first breake the ranke, no
maruell if the souldiers fall to confusion. But in the
meane time, how stands the Deity affected to this alteration
and change? Metit vbi non semina
                        •
                     it▪
                   hee had
neither part nor portion in mans sinne; yet like an excellent
Alchemist, hee drawes water out of the hard
rocke, he turnes this sinne to a further manifestation of
his owne glory: hee created not the elements thus rebellious,

but leauing them to themselues, then began
the insurrection. Now God like a cunning States-man,
so fortifies each partie and faction, and in a iust ballance
weighes out their strength, that being equally
matched, the combate is so doubtfull, as it prolongs
the battell, and at length, in a time best knowne to
himselfe, hee shall no longer interpose himselfe as an
vmpire; but vnbridle them; and giue them free power
to reuenge their owne wrongs, and worke their owne
wrath, and then shall follow the dissolution of nature.
Thus one and the same cause serues as a present token
of mercy, and as a future engine of iustice.
               Fifthly, but I should leese my selfe, I should long
wander in the vast and huge elements; let it suffice, that
none of them are perfect and pure in their owne proper
places and wombes.Of compound bodies. I will descend to mixt and
compound bodies: Here seemes to be the pitch't field,
the place appointed for the combate and encounter of
the elements: see how they take aduantage of the
times, and the seasons, desiring to possesse themselues
of the best parts; as of the strongest holds: they haue
their seuerall sactions, in the body the variety of humours,
according to the periods of ages, and the differences
of complections, they haue their conquest, their
rule, and their gouernment. But let mee stay my selfe,
for if I should proceed in this subiect, I should onely
make a compound of that which before I haue spoken
simple: I will in these mixt bodies, select some proper
defects onely incident to them: I will not here accuse,
I will not arraigne, I will not condemne nature (with
the Paracelsian) for gathering together the cast-away-seedes
of the creatures; and exhaling them to the
wombe of an vpper region, doth there bring forth a
strange Sodomiticall brood. O the abominable filth
and vncleannesse of nature!
               
                  For those mixt imperfect creatures (the wormes,
and the flies) which seeme to excell all others, in the
variety, and excellencie of glittering colours, generantur
ex putri, they are ingendred of corruption; the
basenesse of their birth showes their condition;Imperfect mixt crea
                        •
                     ures. they
are markes of corruption, more imperfect then the elements,
worse then corruption it selfe, being indeed
the fruites of corruption, notwithstanding their
sense, their motion, diuersity of parts and glorious appearance,
yet many of them are bred in an instant, and
die in a moment. There is Ephemera, whose night is a
perpetuall night, some with the distemper of the day,
but all of them with the change of the seasons, returne
to their first mother and nurse corruption. If nature
were sound and entire, either shee would not busie her
selfe, to be get such base and contemptible wormes; rather
she would first preuent the corruption it selfe, and
giue them a more noble birth, and a longer continuance
of life; but being defectiue, and not able to produce
couragious Lions, braue Vnico
                     ••
                  es, fierce Tigers,
stout Elephants, shee makes it her taske and imployment
to be the mother, and mid-wife of wormes,
of gnats, and of butterflies, wherein she seemes most to
abound, and to bring forth a very plentifull brood.
               Secondly, speaking of things compound, giue mee
leaue to compound my argument of two reasons, not
onely in imperfect creatures,The Antipathie of creatures. but likewise in the most
perfect. You shall obserue a strange imperfection, the
wonder of reason, the astonishment of Philosophie;
behold, behold, the cruell and bloodie Antipathie of
creatures; this cannot proceed from elements, or any
temper of contrary qualities; for the elements themselues,
in their owne natiue and proper qualities, are
not so malignant and trecherous: the constitution of
a body may soone bee altered and changed, but you

shall neuer be able to separate the antipathie and hate:
all creatures seeme to bee bred of the same mother
earth, they feede on the earth, and are dissolued to the
earth: whence is the breach of their loue? how came
they seuered, and disioyned in affections? once they
were lodged, and harboured in one common Arke,
from the inundation of waters; did they there striue
for preeminencie, and fall to banding and factions?
seemes it not a great disparagement to the gouernement
of nature, that whereas all creatures were ordained
onely for mans vse, yet some of them should play
the tyrants amongst themselues, and feed onely vpon
blood; and like common Pyrates and robbers, seaze
vpon booties and preyes.
               Me thinkes I heare some punie Philosopher say, that
this antipathie in nature, is recompensed by a contrary
sympathie:The Antipathie is not recompensed by a Sympathie. if this were so, yet were it no sufficient
excuse, considering that whole nature, and all the parts
thereof tend, and are directed to one end; and therefore
should quietly, and patiently together, beare the
same yoake, without any molestation or annoyance, of
hornes, hoofes, tuskes, or clawes: but I feare that this
conceited sympathie, cōsists rather in mans apprehension,
as being a supposed contrary qualitie to antipathie,
without any true ground in nature or reason: this
is my priuate opinion; for I thinke that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , (naturalis
affectus) stands in opposition to antipathie; or if
there were any such sympathie, in regard of the mutuall
helpe, which they receiue from each other, yet this
argues their owne proper weakenesse and imperfection,
and certainly it is not so fierce, and so violent, as is
the current and streame of antipathie. Lord how are
we fallen, how are we fallen, from the garden of Paradise,
to P
                     •
                  ris-garden? here you shall see the dogs hailing
at Bulles, and at Beares; or if you please, it shall

be a stage, or Theater, where you shall see diuersitie of
fashions, the changes and variety of fortunes, feares
and iealousies in loue, and somtimes tragicall conclusions,
all of them the vndoubted markes of corruption.
               You will say that nature, (to preuent the dangerous
issue of Antipathie,) hath remoued such creatures farre
asunder;Enmity in the same kind. and being dreadfull to each other, the very
feare serues for a caution. I pra'y let vs measure out,
and runne ouer this distance; thinke not your labour
lost, for I will leade you from sport, vnto sport; such
cruell &amp; mercilesse sport, as is from the Beare-Garden,
to the Cocke-pit; see how these little imps of Mars,
Cockes of the same kinde, of the same nature, how
eager they are to be in the combate, how brauely and
valiantly they fight, they will sooner die, then forsake
the field: Degeneres animos timor arguit: when wee
thinke they are almost breathlesse, and past life, they
take onely a respite to recouer strength, and to reuenge
their owne wrath, and sometimes vnawares, vpon aduantage,
they giue a deadly wound to their foe; if their
strength &amp; courage were imployed against the cōmon
aduersarie the Kite, it were much more tolerable: but
see what a dangerous thing it is for a war-like nation,
to haue a long and continued peace within themselues;
the inbred choler, and naturall lust, ingender pride, &amp;
breake into wrath; neither pride, nor wrath can endure
equalles, or competitors. As in the dumbe creatures,
so likewise in man; O the immortall enmity of
mortall men! how hardly can States-men be reconciled,

expect continuall warre and dissention; as in man in

regard of his passions, so likewise in the rest of the creatures,
consisting of the same sensible nature with man:
as in man in regard of his offence, so in the creatures,
for mans punishment and vengeance, it stood with the
diuine iustice to set his owne enemies at enmitie within
themselues: and this serues as an vndoubted token
and signe of corruption.
               Hitherto (you will say) yt I haue only insisted in generals,An obiection answered.
and this supposed corruption did only appeare in
reference and relation to others: for true it is, that euery
thing chiefly intends his owne proper happinesse
and perfection: now as a meanes to obtaine this, it desires
to ouertop others, that suppressing them, it might
exalt it selfe, though I doe not approue this obiection;
for nature should be a well gouerned corporation,
consisting of many members and branches; euery part
according to his owne kinde, should be ranked in his
seuerall order, and euery one in particular should principally
and chiefly intend the perfection and preseruation
of the whole, as appeares by daily experience: for
the earth will ascend, or the heauens will bow downe
and descend, rather then an emptinesse or vacuitie
should bee admitted in nature: and therefore euery
thing should containe it selfe within his own bounds,
and not endamage his neighbours: yet for your further
satisfaction and contentment, I will descend to
particulars within themselues.
               
                   Are there not monsters in nature, either defectiue or
superabounding in parts, or differing from the ordinarie
kinde? The Philosophers (who fight most in natures
defence to iustifie her actions) say indeede, that
monsters doe much detract from the perfection of that
particular nature, but not of nature in generall. A monstrous
defence, I confesse, as if the generall did not implie
the particular, as if the whole could subsist without

parts; or that there could be a different condition
of the whole from the parts. But, I pray', how doe they
excuse nature in generall? Forsooth, though deformitie
appeares in the error, yet the varietie serues for the
ornament: then it should seeme, that the Sunne consisting
only of light, for want of diuersitie should bee
base and contemptible, while euery plant and weede
of the fields were highly esteemed, for the various and
delectable colours. It should seeme that nature can no
way set foorth her owne beautie, but she must bring
vgly, deformed, mis-shapen monsters vpon the stage of
this world, that so other creatures base in themselues,
yet comparatiue, in respect of others deformitie,
might seeme beautifull.
               Monsters are rare, and seldom appeare to vs, though
Affrica be a fruitfull mother of monsters, I will therefore
come to the seuerall kindes in nature of the two
sexes. Certainly the males are the more noble,Females are more in number. as consisting
of greater heate, and of a better constitution:
but nature being more and more defectiue, brings
foorth the females in a farre greater number: whereas
in the time of mans innocencie, in the state of perfection,
the number should haue been equall.
               Not to insist in the sexes, I will descend to their actions
in the dumbe creatures. You shall hardly discerne
any tokens or signes of ioy, solus homo est risibilis;
but for sorrow and griefe,The actions of the creatures be token her sorrow. you shall finde very many
and pregnant testimonies. There is in euery creature,
vox naturae inclamantis dominū naturae, the voyce
of nature calling vpon the God of nature; vpon any
wrong or iniustice sustained, they seeme to complaine
with their cries to the God and creator of nature. And
obserue, how apt they are to complaine, in so much
that the very breathing, inspiratio &amp; exspiratio, seemes
to my eares to haue the sound and note of a groane.

Scripture doth likewise witnes as much in effect; the
creatures being subiect to vanitie, groane vnder the
burthen of sinne. Some creatu
                     •
                  es there are, which out
of compassion and pitie seeme to bee true penitentiaries,
as Doues, quarum vox gemebunda est, &amp; oculi lachrymab
                        •
                     les,
whose voyce is a groane, whose eyes are
fountaines of teares. A worthie patterne for our example,
estote serpentes, be wise as serpents to preuent
the voyce of the Charmer: but if once insnared, estote
columbae, then let the sighes of a contrite heart, the
teares of a sorrowfull soule, together with the flood
of Iordane, wash thy vncleannes, thy filth and leprosie
of sinne.
               If the actions as fruites, betoken corruption, then I
will further proceed and search out the roote of this
corruption, which I finde to be in nature her selfe: for
euery thing containeth in it selfe the inbred seedes of
corruption, and the more perfect the creature is, the
more apt for corruption;The more perfect the creature is, the more apt for corruption. as if corruption did belong
to the perfection, in this corrupted state of the creature;
or that nature were enuious, and would not afford
the one without the other. The finest wooll soonest
breedes the moth; the most delicious fruite is aptest
to perish; the fairest beautie hastens to wither; the
strongest oake is most annoyed with the 
                     •
                  uie. Lest
thou shouldest thinke, that outwardly the creatures
were only annoyed, and that the roote were sound
and entire, behold nature discouers her selfe, and
shewes the impostume to haue first bred in that radicall
humour, which is the foundation of nature: for
as it is in trees and in plants, if any one branch or leafe
doe miscarrie, the roote is vnsound; so is it in the outward
workes of nature, these being corrupted, doe vndoubtedly
argue the corruption of nature.
               But you will say, that all this doth onely argue a

weakenes or imperfection,An obiection answered. but no punishment or corruption
in nature: for it stood in the will of the founder,
to make it more or lesse perfect, as are the seuerall
parts in respect of themselues. Now suppose that all
these imperfections were absent, and that God should
ordaine nature, better by many degrees then now she
is extant; yet still there should bee limitations and
bounds of her goodnesse; and for want of a greater
height of perfection, wee might still challenge her to
be in the state of corruption. This obiection will faile,
if the premises be duly considered; for my reasons are
grounded vpon nature, supposing the state wherein she
consists, and not in reference to any higher condition,
wherein she might haue been, first ordained by God:
and therefore for the vpshot and conclusion, I will vse
this last reason.
               Nature is able to bring nothing to perfection, I 
speake in her owne kinde, and in the state wherein she
stands, and therefore acknowledge euen in the same
state her corruption and punishment:N
                        •
                     ture brings nothing to perfection. for at first it
stood with the wisedome of the founder, according to
the scope and marke aimed at, and intended in the creation,
to impart vertue and strength to the creature; hauing
directed nature to these ends, she should of her
owne selfe attaine to those ends. But see the corruption,
see how she failes in her purposes: Man, without
education, is like the dumbe beast, sauage and wilde:
the dumbe beasts of themselues are meerely vnprofitable;
the horse must be taught to hold vp his head, to
learne his pace, and must bee trained vp for the seruice
of warre; the trees want lopping, pruning, &amp; grafting;
the sweete and the bitter Almond doe not differ in
kinde, but onely in husbandrie and vsage; plants must
be watered and digged; the earth mellowed and mended;
mettals purified and clensed: and by whom shall

all this bee performed? if by a superiour agent, then
might it be done without disparag
                     •
                  ment; but if a base
and inferiour should vndertake to controwle and correct
nature in her actions, this were a high contempt
and indignity. Here are not second causes, which require
the concourse and influence of their first mouers,
but nature is to bee taught and instructed by her handmaid,
to receiue her last and finall perfection from her
vassall and slaue, that ill-fauoured ape, mistrisse Arte,
forsooth, the learned gossip, which doth all things by
imitation, taking her grounds and principles of action
from nature; she must be sent for as a mid-wife to help
the deliuerie: and hence issues such numbers and
troupes of Artes, together with such infinite inuentions
of men; and among others, the Chemicall Arte,
though it deserues high commendation, being rare
and wonderfull in her operations, yet with her vaine-glory
and ostentation, shee hath greatly wronged and
prouock't nature, in so much that if nature were not
wholly cast downe and deiected, rather then she would
endure the intolerable boasting and bragging of
Mountebankes, shee would attempt the vttermost of
her power.
               To conclude this one poynt,The summe of all the former reasons. considering, first, that
nature so much aboundeth in euill; secondly, and is so
much enclined vnto euill; thirdly, considering how the
heauens stand affected to the earth; fourthly, how elements
amongst themselues; fifthly, how mixt creatures
one to another; sixthly, and in themselues
what defects and imperfections there are; seuenthly,
how Art serues like a cobler, or tinker, to peece vp the
walles, and to repaire the ruines of nature: I hope it wil
sufficiently appeare that she is corrupted, and much declined
from her first perfection, which certainly was
intended by the founder, and by all probable coniecture

was imparted to her, in her first institution. I could
bee infinite in this point, but indeed it is not so pertinent,
nor doth it so nearely concerne my text; I haue
already alleaged seauen arguments to this purpose;
seauen is a perfect number; as I challenge a rest on the
seauenth day, so heere I will rest in my seauenth argument.
               Now in this great vprore and tumult of nature,A transition to man. when
heauen and earth seeme to threaten a finall destruction;
giue me leaue with the Marriners of Ionas ship, to
cast lots, and search out the first occasion of this euill.
Alas, alas, the lot falles vpon man: man alone of all other
creatures, in regard of the freedome of his will,
and the choyce of his owne actions, being onely capable
of the transgression, the rest of the creatures are
wholly excluded from the offence; the punishment (I
confesse) appeares in them, but chiefly and principally
in man: I will therefore descend from the great world,
to this little world, which first set on fire, and inflamed
the whole; for I should greatly wrong my selfe, if I
should loose so much time, as to take a generall suruey
of nature, to wander in the desarts and caues of the
creatures, to search out their imperfections; I will
therefore tie my selfe to man, and by man alone the
fall &amp; corruption shall manifestly appeare. My proofes
and arguments I will dispose into three seuerall ranks:
first, for such things which seeme to bee proper and peculiar
to man, in regard of his constitution, whereof all
nature cannot furnish vs with the like example and
president;The three parts of this Treatise. and therefore wee may well suppose, that
they are the peculiar punishments of mans sinne. Secondly,
I will speake of mans condition in generall, and compare man with the beast of the field; whereby it
shall appeare, that our misery is far greater then theirs,
contrary to the first intent and institution of nature,

wherein she gaue vs a greater dignitie, and so consequently
should impart a greater measure of happinesse.
Thirdly, I will insist in those particular punishments of
sinne, which are related in Scripture to bee the punishments
of the first sinne; wherein I will shew the truth,
the certainty, and I will examine them by the touchstone
and light of our naturall reason.
               Speaking of mans co
                     •
                  stitution,That man is compoun
                        •
                     ed. it must be supposed,
that he consists of seuerall and different parts, which
appeares by his composition, and dissolution; the seuerall
faculties resident in seuerall vessels; the seuerall
senses tied to their seuerall organs; whereas if his nature
were simple, and not compounded, it should admit
no such variety of parts, no such diuersity of functio
                     •
                  s;
but shall haue a state constant and stable, homogeneall,
euery way like vnto it selfe. If then man be compounded,
then assuredly nature requires the fewest
principles; as there appeares onely action or passion in
man, so more is not required in man, saue onely the
two seuerall fountaines of action, or passion; then let
me spare my selfe a needlesse and vnprofitable labour,
for the whole world did euer acknowledge in man, as
in all other creatures, matter, and forme. I will therefore
lay downe this as a ground-worke or supposition,
that man consists of two parts; a body sensible, materiall,
corruptible; and a souleMan consists of a body and soule. intelligent, spirituall, and
incorruptible: for his body, I will referre him to the
triall of all your se
                     •
                  ses, that hee is no shadow, or phantasie,
but really consisting of a true body, and such a body
as tends to corruption: if any man doubt of it, I
could wish that his pasport were made, that with the
whip and the scourge, he might bee conueyed to Golgotha,
where he should finde sculles of all sizes.
               For his soule, that it is intelligent, not guided, or carried
by the streame of nature, as a dumb beast, but able

to discourse, to gather one truth from another, containing
in it selfe the seedes of all knowledge. If any man
seeme to denie this, I will not argue or conuince him
by reason, for hee is not capable of a reasonable discourse;
but (for his punishment) I will ranke him in the
number of vnreasonable creatures, among the bruit
beasts, &amp;c.The soule is a spirit. Now if this soule bee intelligent, then certainly
spirituall, as not consisting of any earthly matter,
which well appeares by the quicke apprehension, the
strange and admirable operations, conceiuing things
immateriall, able to abstract things from their owne
nature, vnderstanding the grosse and earthly substance
in a spirituall manner; and howsoeuer the inclination
of the flesh, or the disposition of humours stand, (for
these may moue and affect) yet still shee retai

                  es the
Lordship, and gouernment of her owne actions, not
violently carried by an instinct of nature, but hauing
a free-will in her owne choyce and election, which vndoubtedly
argues a higher descent, a greater petegree
and linage then these base elements can afford her, or
can proceed from a well tempered body.
               That there should bee spirituall substances in generall,Spirituall substances.
let vs first flie aboue the conuexitie of the heauens,
where elements, and elementarie bodies cannot ascend.
Can you conceiue, that there should bee a vast
wildernesse, vnhabited, vnpeopled, lie naked and empty,
or rather furnish't with heauenly and spirituall substances,
according to the condition of that place, as is
this elementarie world, with bodies grosse and terrestriall?
the Philosophers shewing the worlds perfection
by the diuersitie of creatures; some materiall, some
spirituall, &amp;c. as likewise by the various and strange
motion of the heauens, which being simple bodies,
should haue one simple motion; and yet their motion
being not simple, not for the preseruation of themselues,

and that in their owne proper places, where euery
other creature hath rest, peace, and contentment,
doe hence vndoubtedly conclude, that the heauens
are moued by intelligences, and in token hereof, there
are influences, qualities not materiall, the operation
whereof cannot bee preuented by application of any
other elementarie or contrary qualitie: and such is
the force of these influences, as that the Moone being
the weakest of all other planets in power, yet is able
to moue the huge Ocean, without any corporall engine
or instrument. And surely the heauens can bee
no otherwise moued then by intelligences,The Angels are Intelligences. which in
effect are Angels: for in nature, no reason can bee assigned
why they should moue, not mouing for themselues,
but for others, and therefore are moued by others:
or looking to them and to their outward forme,
no reason can be assigned, why they might not as well
moue from the West to the East, as from the East to
the West; and the motion it selfe is so strange and so
wonderfull, that the minde of man being an intelligent
spirit, notwithstanding our studies, our circles,
excentric, concentric, epicicle, and the like, yet wee
cannot possibly describe the motion, and trace out
their paths, but we must be inforced to vse impossible
suppositiōs, that the earth should turne vpon wheeles,
and moue with her owne weight, or that there should
be penetration of bodies, which is a farre greater absurditie:
and therefore this strange and wonderfull
motion must needs be effected by some intelligent spirits.
Thus the schoole of the Heathen did acknowledge
as much in effect, concerning the truth and certaintie
of Angels, as our Christian faith doth oblige vs for our
beleefe.
               Let vs descend from heauen vnto earth: Consider
how the elements themselues doe exceede each other,

in finenesse and rarietie, and therein come neerer and
neerer the nature of spirits; insomuch that the fire and
the aire are scarse sensible, the sight not apprehending
them. Are there not motes, which cannot be discerned
but in the Sunne-beames? and in euery dumbe
creature, is not the forme spirituall,All formes are spirituall. as being the more
noble part of the creature, though hidden and concealed,
hauing both wombe and tombe in the matter, and
therefore being impotent of her selfe, wants a naturall
instinct for her guide and direction? If this forme were
not spirituall, then what penetration of bodies should
be admitted? how slowly should the actions proceed,
considering little wormes, which in themselues and in
their whole bodies are scarse sensible? What should
we thinke of their forme, they haue varietie of senses,
of motion, they haue varietie of parts, of members, of
limbes, and of ioynts? or why should all qualitie bee
immateriall, were it not because they proceed from the
forme which is immateriall; as on the contrary, quantitie
is therefore extended and seemes to be grosse and
terrestriall, because it proceeds from the matter, and i
                     •
                  
applied for dimēsions: but of all qualities, it doth more
manifestly appeare in the obiects of our sight, as colour
and light, which are diffused in a moment, thorough
the compasse of the whole world, and finde no opposition
in their passage. Thus certainly the formes of
things are substances immateriall: but most especially
for mans soule which is reasonable, were it not freed
and exempted from any elementarie composition, it
could neuer iudge aright of all bodies; but according
to her temperature, thereafter should follow her censure,
thereafter her appetite and inclination, so that the
freedome of mans will should suffer violence. If then
you will suppose in man, a true iudgement of things,
and a free libertie in his choice, you must conceiue the

soule as a spirit, which is the ground and foundation of
both, whereby hauing onely the diuine concourse and
assistance, she is not carried with any naturall instinct,
as a dumbe instrument, but is the roote and fountaine,
as of her faculties, so of her actions.
               If this soule bee spirituall, then certainly immortall,The immortalitie of the soule.
as being exempted &amp; freed from the opposition and
contrarietie of elementarie qualities, whichis the only
motiue and inducement to corruption: she comprehends
and vnderstands things immortall, some of them
being bare and dumbe instruments ordained only for
her vse and seruice, suppose the Sunne, the Moone, and
the Starres: and therefore wee cannot thinke, that she
should be of lesse perfection, as touching her time and
continuance. The desires of the soule are infinite, shee
intends nothing so much as eternitie: this is naturally
ingrafted in all of vs, and nature cannot faile in her
ends. Consider the maine infusions, which euery man
findes in himselfe: sometimes his minde, either in
dreames, or in the strong apprehension of his owne
thoughts, seemes to presage euill, and this euill vndoubtedly
followes. Seldome or neuer doe any great
accidents befall vs, but the minde seemes to prophecie
and foretell such euents. Consider againe the many visions
and apparitions, which from age to age haue bin
discouered among the dead, whereof the best authors,
the most learned and iudicious make mention. For as I
cannot excuse all superstition in this kinde; so absolutely
and simply to denie this truth, were heathenisme
and infidelitie.
               The course and order of the whole vniuerse requires
as much in effect: For as the power of God hath alreadie
appeared in the creation; his wisedome in the disposing;
his prouidence in the preseruing of nature, and
so for the rest of his attributes, &amp;c. so there must be a

time when the iustice of God shall reueale it selfe:Gods iustice doth inferre the immortalitie of the soule.
which iustice, as it is most commendable in man, so is it
much more eminent in God. This iustice, in respect of
the whole world, must onely bee exercised vpon man:
for all the rest of the creatures are carried with the violence
and streame of their nature; only man hath a discoursiue
reason, whereby he may consult of his owne
actions; and being once resolued, he hath a free will for
his owne choice and election, and therfore man (aboue
all other creatures) must be accomptable for his actiōs.
And to this end, God hath giuen him this propertie,
that hauing once performed a worke, he begins to reflect
and examine things past; that so it might serue either
as a sampler for amendment, or as a corosiue for
repentance. Vpon this due examination there followes
either such a ioy and contentment, as cannot arise from
a sensitiue part, nor cannot bee imparted to a dumbe
beast: or else such a terror, such a feare, such a sting of
conscience, as makes man, aboue all other creatures,
the most miserable. Now I confesse with the heathen,
that in the course of this life, Gods iustice doth not sufficiently
appeare: and rather then this iustice should
suffer the least eclipse or imputation, I will shake the
foundations of the earth, and proclaime a new heauen,
and a new earth. And in the mean time, to finde out
the infallible effects of this iustice, I will rake vp the
ashes, and in the dead embers of mans putrified and
corrupted carcase, I will extract an inuisible and immortall
soule; which being the suruiuor, shall be liable
to the paiments of debts; and according to the sins or
deserts, according to the measure and extent of Gods
mercie or iustice, shall be a subiect capable of punishment
or glorie.
               Hauing spoken of the seuerall parts of his constitution,
now at length wee haue agreed vpon man, wee

haue laid hold on him, and apprehended the partie:
now let vs proceed in our plea, put in our bils and our
articles, and take our exceptions against him. My first
obiection is this:That one part of man should be corruptible the other incorruptible. All other creatures subsist, as long as
their forme subsists; for the matter and the forme are
both twinnes, concelued in the same instant, vnder the
same constellation, and therefore should haue the like
continuance of being, and the like successe in their actions.
Only in man you shall obserue the difference;
his soule is immortall, made of a most durable met
                     •
                  all,
and yet contained within the brittle vessell of his weak
flesh; as if she were no part of man, but did inhabit in
Tents, and in Tabernacles in the wildernesse, alwaies
remouing and changing her dwelling, hauing no certaine
mansion house to containe her.
               What things are coupled in nature, should necessarily
symbolize, and bee tied together by some band,
which should equally partake of both. Here is the flesh
and the spirit vnited; but where is that band, which
being neither flesh nor spirit, should partake of both,
and couple both; where is the league or the amitie?
Here are no intelligencers assigned to their celestiall
orbs, no Angels conuersing with Angels; but the flesh
with the spirit, corruptible with incorruptible, mortall
with immortall, liue together vnder one roofe, they
are the household seruants of one man, and are linckt
together in one person: whereas the Philosopher saith,
Corruptibile § incorruptibile differunt plusquam genere:
Things corruptible and incorruptible, they do not
differ in number, they doe not differ in kinde; but they
seeme to belong to a diuers and a different world, the
world of eternitie, and the world of corruption: and
therefore in reason should not admit any fellowship or
societie betweene themselues, much lesse be the members
of one and the same corporation.
               
                  Me thinkes I call to minde the practise of the tyrant,
who was wont to couple the liuing bodies of men, to
the dead carkasses of others, impar coningium, that, being
not able to quicken and reuiue each other, they
might together corrupt and consu
                     •
                  e. Here is the like
tyrannie: for it is strange and wonderfull (much against
the ordinarie course of nature) either how such seuerall
and different parts should be linckt together, to make
vp one subiect, visible, corruptible, earthly, according
to the fl
                     •
                  sh; inuisible, incorruptible, heauenly, according
to the spirit: or being once knit together, and a
league of amitie, consisting in a mutual sympathie betweene
both, concluded, what should at length cause
the dissolution?
               That man should die, when the better part of man is
yet extant; that for want of the more ignoble and base
part (the vse of the bodie) the soule should not be able
to exercise her faculties, either of growth and nourishment,
or of sense and motion; but like a comfortlesse
widow should be strictly tied to her thirds, only
the intellectuall part, being her owne proper dowrie,
hauing gotten no surplusage to her estate, by vertue of
her mariage. When the husband is once dead, then is
the wife let at libertie, from the law of her husband;
but the soule is excluded from any second mariage,
and cannot couple herselfe to another; she is inforced
to a widowhood, and cannot obtaine the like fredome
in her choice, which formerly she had in the time of her
virginitie. All nature, the whole world cannot affoord
the like president: and therefore acknowledge, that it
proceedes from the corruption of man, as a proper and
peculiar punishment to man.
               You will say, that this property makes the difference
of his nature, as differing from all other creatures; from
the Angels in regard of his flesh; from the beasts in regard

of his spirit: and therefore no marueile, if this be
proper and peculiar to himselfe, as being the speciall
difference of man, and not any punishment of sinne,
This obiection proceedes from an error; for the difference
of man consists in the reasonable soule, and not
in the mortalitie or immortalitie of parts: so I will
proceede to a seconde argument.
               
                   If it seemes some kinde of disparagement, that the
immortall soule should bee contracted in mariage to
the mortall flesh (for mariage should alwai

                   suppose
an equalitie);The base intertainment of the reasonable soule. then me thinks nature should make some
recompence in the noblenesse of mans birth. Behold
then I will describe the solemnitie of these nuptials; after
her first approch and infusion, for many moneths
the soule is kept prisoner in the wombe, a place noysome
for sent, vncleane for situation, a dungeon for
darknesse. As man himselfe is conceiued in sinne; so is
the soule concealed in shame: the eyes will not dare to
behold; chaste eares would bee offended to heare; let
not any tongue presume to speake, the vncleannesse of
mans birth; see how he crouches with his head on his
knees like a tumbler, wallowing in his owne excrements,
feeding vpon the impurest blood, breathing
thorough the most vncleane passages; in so much that
Christ, who came to be spit vpon, to bee whipt, to bee
troden, to bee crucified onely for mans sake, yet would
neuer endure the basenesse of his conception. I speake
not of the foulnesse of mans sinne and concupiseence;
but of his naturall vncleannesse, being the vndoubted
token and signe of his sinfull condition. I will no longer
defile my speech with this subiect, let the Anatomist
speake for himselfe in his owne art: En qui superbis
homuncio, terra &amp; cinis, inter excrementa natus; inter
intestinum rectum &amp; vesicam.
               
               Now when all things are fully accomplished, ad

vmbilicum vsque perductus, I had thought that there
should haue been some more conuenient dwelling, and
fitter for the entertainment of the reasonable soule:That mā shoud haue no more parts then the dumbe beasts.
for as the sensatiue hath more noble faculties then the
vegetatiue; so hath it more parts and more offices assigned
for her seruice; then why should not some difference,
and some addition bee made betweene reason
and sense? Man consists of a liuer for his nourishment,
of an heart for his vitall spirits, of a braine for his sense:
this is all, and all the beasts of the field haue as much.
But you wil answere me, that man hath (in this time of
corruptiō) as many parts, as euer the first man is supposed
to haue, or to bring with him from Paradise, in the
state of perfection. My answere is, that the grace, which
in the time of mans innocencie did accompanie nature,
supplied all the defects, and was sufficient of it selfe: but
man being depriued of that grace, might iustly claime
and challenge (according to the excellencie of his own
condition) something in nature, some super a bounding
parts in his bodie, to betoken the dignitie of his reasonable
soule, aboue the state of the sensatiue.
               You will say, that her prerogatiue consists not in the
number, but in the goodnesse and qualitie of parts:
Princes may finde entertainment in priuate mens houses,
but their state shall appeare in their owne hangings
and furniture.Mans senses are worse then the creatures. Certainly man comes short of other
creatures for euery sense; the Eagle for sight, the
Hounds for their sent, the Buck for his hearing, the Ape
for his taste, the Wormes for their touch: and for the
inward senses, which are the proper and neerest instruments
of the vnderstanding, he that shall well consider
the strange and wonderfull operation of the creatures
in their owne kinde, how curious the birds are in building
their nests; how prouident euery thing is, for the
preseruation of it selfe; how admirable the beasts are in

their naturall workes; the knowledge whereof, whereby
they are directed in these actions, consists in the
phansie; hee will easily confesse, that in their inward
senses, they cannot but farre exceede man. If you replie,
that mans temper and senses, though otherwise
none of the best, yet are best applied and accommodated
for mans seruice and vse, as they are the dumbe instrumēts
of a reasonable soule. This is a fond &amp; an idle
suggestion: for who can know or trie the contratie?
but surely the best should alwaies be fitted for the best,
and this stands with a right and equall proportion according
to iustice.
               
                   Suppose there were such disparitie in the state and
condition of both, and that the dull flesh could not
giue any sufficient entertainment to so royall a spouse;
yet the weake abilitie and power would be accepted,
if the flesh did performe what it might. For if an honorable
Ladle should intend to match with her seruant;
the greatest motiue and inducement would be, that in
stead of a husband, hee would be her slaue, she should
haue the rule and sole gouernment, and all his care
should be to giue her contentment: a very forcible argument,
I confesse. Now let vs examine how well the
flesh hath performed this dutie and seruice.
               Behold in the parts of man a great opposition, and
antipathie, between the flesh and the spirit (as it were)
encountring each other.The opposition betweene the flesh and the spirit. Can a kingdome diuided in it
selfe proceed from nature, which intends an vniforme
order and course in the creatures? I grant there may be
contrarietie of qualities in one and the same subiect,
consisting of contrarie elements, for here the subiect
is capable of contrarietie: but in parts of different nature,
of different condition, where the one by nature is
subordinate to the other; that there should be such opposition,
it is exemplum sine exemplo, the whole fabrick

and course of nature cannot parallel this with a president;
that man should reflect vpon his owne actions,
should suruay, and view his owne workes, and that his
owne soule should discerne and condemne the inclination
and practise of his owne flesh; that man distracted
and discontented, should say in the agonie of
his minde, I see another law in my members, rebelling against
the law of my spirit: Doubtlesse, non sic fuit ab
initio, both of them proceede from one God, both of
them are parts of one man, and therefore (as fellow
yokemen) should tend ioyntly together, to one and
the same end, the happinesse and perfection of man:
as in nature there is no contrarietie betweene the matter
&amp; forme, the one is actiue, the other passiue; the one
apt to giue, the other apt to receiue impressiō; the one
giuing beautie and splendor, the other supporting and
vpholding the action. There is no difference betweene
thē, no more then there is between quantitie and qualitie,
rather helping and furthering, then any way hindring
or opposing each others propertie; only in man,
in man alone consists the difference. And therefore acknowledge
it not as the first intent and institution of
nature, but as a punishmēt of sin; God, requiting mans
disobedience, to shew the high wisedome of his gouernment,
&amp; the proportion of his iustice, sets the parts
of man at enmitie with themselues, which before did
together conspire against their God and creator.
               You will say, that this is but a light skirmish; some 
little disagreeing hinders not the loue, but rather inflames
the affection; all this enmitie proceedes from
one ground,No manner of subordination. that the parts, being of a different kinde,
must likewise be carried with a different inclination.
I will therefore further insist, that in man there is not
that consent, and harmonie of parts, which is requisite
for the vnitie of a person: sometimes the soule proues

the mint of our actions, and brands them with her own
stampe; and somtimes the bodie ouerrules the freedom
of our wils, and beares the whole sway; mores sequuntur
hum res, Physiognomie and iudiciall Astrologie,
take this for the ground and foundation of their truth.
Is it not yet resolued who should beare rule? or must
it consist of alterations, changes and turnes? or doe
they seeke to preuent each other? Capiat qui capere potest,
quod nullius est hominis, id iure sit occupant

                     s, as if
they did both striue for the empire, which as yet were
not intailed to any certaine familie or tribe.
               But obserue a farre greater enormitie: whereas the
reasonable soule containes in it selfe the sensatiue and
vegetatiue faculties; why should she not correct their
errors, mistakings, and defects? why should not the
reasonable soule intermeddle with the concoctions,The reasonable soule not in
                        ••
                     rmedling in the concoctions.
nourishment and growth of the bodie? If any thing
lies heauie on the stomacke, as she knowes the disease,
and feeles the burthen; so why should not the reasonable
soule haue power to remoue it? Seemes it not a
great disorder in nature, that in the bodie of man there
should bee two subordinate soules; and both of them
should haue their seuerall and distinct operations, as if
they should rather constitute two seuerall creatures,
then ioyntly concurre to the vnitie of one person; the
sensatiue soule intending the workes of nature, the
reasonable soule taking only charge of such things, as
require free choice and election: could not all things
be more easily performed by one and the same faculty,
as in al other creatures? Then should there be no greater
difficultie to cleanse the vncleane blood, to purge
the grosse melancholie, then now we finde in taking away
some spot or blemish from the outward skinne;
then should not the secret causes of sudden death (as it
were priuie conspiracies) suddenly assault and attempt

man, but man in his owne wisedome should timely
foresee, and preuent them.
               Wherefore serue fibres, muscles or tendons for receiuing,
retaining, or expulsion of foode, if the soule
hath no power to apply them? The perfectiō of nature
(especially) consists within her most secret pauilions:
shall the soule bee able to moue the thigh,How the inward parts are disposed. the legge,
the arme, the whole body? and yet the least scruple of
poyson lying in the ventricle, shall she not be able to
disgorge and expell it? In other creatures (I confesse)
there is an ordinarie course of nature, as in all their actions
an ordinary instinct of nature: they haue a time of
rising, a period and time of setting; they can no more
order their steps, or their waies, then they can change
their cōplectiō or growth. But it should be otherwise
in man, who as he is Lord of his outward actions; so he
should haue the full power and command of himselfe,
and of the most inward and secret operations of his
own body: for the same reason would sufficiently serue
to direct both alike. But see, see, whole man is corrupted,
and therefore neither body with soule, nor soule
with her faculties can together consist; all is in an vprore,
since wee forsooke him, who is the very bond of
all peace, and agreement.
               If neither opposition betweene both, nor want of 
subiection and right gouernment seemes strange, then
I will tell you a greater wonder. The soule and the
body,The soule and the bodie are strangers to each other. though parts of one man, and mutually subsisting
together; yet are they strangers one to another,
not any way acquainted with the counsels and secresies
of each other. Whatsoeuer is proper and peculiar to
the soule (for her faculties, her nature, and powers) she
doth not any way impart it to the whole man, but only
by way of reflection: looking vpon the actions wee
iudge of the substance; and so wee might doe if wee liued

among strangers and heathen, though certainly
the soule cannot be ignorant of her self. Againe, whatsoeuer
is proper to the body, as forme, figure, the vse
and disposition of the inward parts, notwithstanding
that the soule first squared out the body, and fashioned
the members for her owne vse and seruice, anima fabricatur
sibi domicilium; yet she knowes them not, and
therefore must learne them againe by inspection, and
dissection of mans body: a cruell, bloody, and mercilesse
spectacle, I confesse; yet such as must be admitted
in schooles, rather then wee should be ignorant of our
owne bodies. Thus farre as the soule and the body are
the obiects of our knowledge: now in their owne operations,
see how they are estranged from each other.
               Parts as they cannot subsist without the whole, so
neither should they bee able to worke of themselues;
but in man you shall obserue actions, which are appropriated
to either part, to the soule and to the body, and
cannot be imparted to both. Though the present condition
of man bee earthly, made of the earth, feeds on
the earth, and is dissolued to the earth, and therfore the
soule doth lesse discouer her selfe by her proper actions,
then doth the materiall body;An extasis. yet it is not vnknowne
to Philosophie, that there is an extasis of the
soule, wherein she is carried in a trance, wholly and
only intending the intellectuall functions, while the
body lies dead like a carkasse, without breath, sense,
motion, or nourishment, onely as a pledge to assure vs
of the soules returne. And vpon her returne, hauing talked
with God, or been transfigured in the mount, shee
giues the body no such intelligence or message, but
deemes it as a dumbe beast, not fit to bee acquainted
with so high mysteries; so that the whole man is ignorant,
what hath befalne the better part of himselfe.
               Now see how the body requites this vnkindnesse

and diseurtesie. It is naturall to euery forme, that if it be
extant,Our infancie. it should bee alwaies in action; especially the
more noble forme finds the greater imployment: but
obserue the difference in man; for many yeeres after his
birth, he is like an vnreasonable creature, feedes on the
pappe, and lies in the cradle, intending only the actions
of nature, and giuing no outward appearance of his
reasonable soule; in so much, that were it not for the
feature and forme of his body, you should hardly discerne
his kinde: whereas in all other creatures you
shall instantly discerne, in the first moment of their
birth, actions proper and peculiar to their state and
condition.
               But I will passe ouer our infancie, we haue forgotten
those daies, being now arriued to our full age: I will
therfore make a second instance; once within the compasse
of a naturall day, in the time of our rest and our
sleepe,Sleepe. where is there any appearance of a reasonable
soule? There is nourishment (I confesse); for nature will
haue her course in the 
                     •
                  euerall concoctions: there is
sense (I confesse); for the body being easily toucht, presently
it awakens: there is likewise an inward sense, as
appeares by our dreames, and the renewing of our decaied
spirits: but for the reasonable soule; there is a
sleepe indeede, a dead sleepe, euen the true image of
death, without any shew or appearance of life.
               Lest I should be thought a theefe or a coward, thus
to steale vpon man, in the time of his sleepe, to stop his
winde, to strangle and choke him in his naked bed, that
he should not be able to speake for himselfe, and to denie
his owne corruption: I will therefore goe from his
naked bed to Bedlam,Mad men. where you shall finde men naked
out of their beds; poore sillie wretches, poore sillie
wretches, some of them with outragious fits arising
from heate and from choler: others with melancholie

deepe impressions, frame vnto themselues fancies of all
kindes: some with night watchings and studies, hastening
to bee wise, lost their owne wits: others in their
loue-passions imparted themselues, and now rest, in
their rage and their furie, besides themselues: how are
they tormented, tied to the stakes, whipt with cords,
dieted with hunger, tempered with coldnes? The irons
enter into their flesh, they are vsed in the nature of wild
beasts; but their greatest miserie is, that they haue no
feeling of their owne miserie. Thinke not this punishment
to be casuall and accidentall to man, for these are
Lunatickes; the heauens haue their actions, and God
hath his prouidence in them: see how the rebellious
flesh hath cleane vanquisht the spirit: O what is man,
if man be left vnto himselfe! Of all thy temporall blessings
and graces, O Lord, I doe giue thee most humble
thankes for the right vse of my wits and my senses.
               
               I dare not long conuerse with mad men, I confesse
indeed that once they were sober, and gaue some token
of a reasonable soule: I will now come vnto them,
who are of a milder constitution, with whom I may
more freely conuerse, and to whom I may approch
with lesse feare; for these are innocents and ideots,Ideots. let
vs heare how wisely they will answere for themselues?
But I will spare them that labour, for if you can teach
them to aske meate in their hunger, drinke in their
thirst, to complain of coldnesse when it pincheth them,
here is the height and top of their learning; as yet they
are not arriued to common sense; yet commonly they
are men of sound bodies, sanguine complections, good
health, long life, nothing is wanting, but onely that in
man, you shall not finde man. A president without
patterne, a punishment onely proper and peculiar to
man; no other sensible creature, either in his birth, or
his sleepe, or in his madnesse, much lesse in the whole

course of his life, did euer appeare without sense: who
euer saw a quick plant without sappe in the roote? But
in token, that the first sinne of man was the curiositie
of knowledge, (for the penaltie of this sinne) God hath
reserued in his owne power, the free disposing of mans
reason; that notwithstanding his reasonable soule, his
education, learning, or discipline; yet God hath not
tied himselfe to concurre with man in the action; a benefit,
which being in the same kinde, and seeming naturall
and essentiall to the same kinde, God neuer denies
to the rest of his creatures.
               I will now alter and change my course: for hauing 
spoken in generall of the nature of the soule, and of
some particular persons, and states of men, vpon particular
occasions; I will now speake in generall of whole
mankinde, and of the particular actions both of the
soule,The soule hath all her knowledge by learning. &amp; of the body. The soule, though reasonable; yet
in her selfe, as from her selfe, seemes to haue no vnderstanding;
she hath no infusions, as the Angels haue; no
ingraf
                     •
                  ed knowledge, as other creatures haue in their
owne kinde, but only a power and capacitie to vnderstand.
In the vse and exercise whereof, sometimes the
minde is distracted with varietie of her own thoughts,
and cannot intend to direct the edge of her vnderstanding,
but our wits are wandring and a woolgathering;
here the soule is growne impotent and weak, and hath
not the power of her selfe: and yet in the meane time,
how is she perplexed and tormented with ignorance,
possessed with an immoderate thirst of knowledge,
with a curiositie of knowledge? And on the other side,
what great difficultie and labour appeares in the purchase
of wisedome? It is gotten by long experience,
and the triall of many conclusions: all ages are not
come to that staiednes, which is requisite for the att
                     •
                  ining
of wisedome. When it is gotten, when it is at the

height, then our memorie begins to faile vs, wee know
not how to keepe such a treasure: or else you shall discerne
a sensible change in our nature; for being old, we
grow young againe, not in yeeres, but in affections;
there is no difference betweene the toyes and fond
                     •
                  es
of youth, and the forgetfulnes and dotage of age, both
are the same in effect: and here wisedome seemes like a
motheaten garment, which hath been heretofore of
some value, but now, for want of rep
                     •
                  iring or trimming,
serues for no further vse or imployment.
               Thus farre the soule in her selfe. Now let vs see
what comfort and furtherance she receiues from the
body.The soule is hindred in her knowledge by the body. Parts should haue the greatest reference to themselues,
as wanting each others helpe, and supporting
each other: so that it stood with the wisedome and intention
of nature, in the beginning to fit and to square
them one for the other; so that the body in reason
should further the actions of the reasonable soule. But
it falles out otherwise, a full stomacke sends vp grosse
fumes, which intoxicate the braine: the largest and
best diet, can spare the least, and that the worst nourishmēt
for the sensatiue spirits: the fattest soile yeelds
the foggiest wit; while the fruitlesse sands, the heath,
the rockes, the mountaines, seeme to make some recompence
for their barrennesse with a plentifull inuention.
But to come to the immediate actions of the vnderstanding;
what greater obstacle or hindrance can
be, then is the burthen and weight of the body? our
mindes distracted with senses, the senses not rightly
informing; sometimes deluding with snowes, sometimes
deceiuing with fancies; neuer apprehending
things in their true value and proportion; and when
they are best disposed, yet their bill of information
must be further examined: for we doe not receiue the
things themselues, but the species or images of things,

which being presented to our vnderstanding, most
commonly wee iudge according to our passions. But
what doe we receiue from the senses? surely sensible
obiects, and not intelligible obiects; for the senses are
onely imployed in particulars, which doe not belong
to the court or cognizance of the vnderstanding, which
onely conceaues the generals; as if the sense should
speake in an vnknowen tongue, or in a strange language.
And therefore the vnderstanding must first eleuate
and giue them a new tincture, before they can
come to his censure, hence proceeds that distinction
of schooles, intellectus agens, and intellectus patiens,
whereas all sense consists in one passion.
               You will say, that although the vnderstanding bee
inforced to make his owne obiects,The vnderstanding makes her owne obiects. yet is it donne with
the greatest facilitie, and ease, a naturall action. For the
soule out of her owne actiuitie, is able to abstract, her
owne obiects from the matter, and to giue them a like
condition to her selfe; assuredly, all the difficulty in
knowledge consists in raysing these obiects. Wherfore
serue all the rules of Logicke? why should we striue so
much for a right method? were it not that the difficulty
consists in the discouery of the truth. The Lawyer deserues
high commendation, if he can truly open his
cause, though hee neuer passe his iudgement. From
whence ariseth all the diuersities of mens opinions,
when as reason is the same in all men? We doe not differ
about coulors, we do not differ about sensible obiects:
onely the difference is in the discouery of a truth,
which in effect is asmuch as in raising these intelligible
obiects; for if the truth lay open and naked, all men
would easily assent vnto it. Me thinks it should stand
with right reason, that as sense hath sensible obiects; so
things themselues should present themselues to the vnderstanding,
that the minde should not busie her selfe,

to make her owne obiects intelligible, but should onely
passe her iudgement and censure. This is the condition
of dumbe beasts in regard of their sense; this is the
state of the Angels, in regard of their infusion; and this
should haue bin the state and condition of man, were it
not, that man is falne from the state of his first integrity,
and happinesse, to a state of corruption.
               
                   From the vnderstanding let vs come to the will;
strange it is to obserue the intestine warre,Our will is distracted. which man
wageth with himselfe, possessed with contrary iudgements,
insomuch that he proues a stranger to himselfe,
not knowing the resolution of his owne minde. And
thus breaking forth into contrary wils, not knowing
how himselfe stands affected, sometimes hee will,
sometimes he will not one and the same action; it being
the selfe same, giuing no cause of the alteration
and change of his will. Thus not guided by nature, as all
other creatures are, hee stands like a blind man, and
knowes not how to make choice of his own wayes.
               How vnfitly hath nature disposed of mans will;How the boundlesse appetites of man do perplex him. it
seemes that al other mans faculties are finite, contained
within very narrow bankes. The wisdom of man is foolishnes,
and serues onely to giue him occasion to see
his owne ignorance, hoc vnum scio, me nihil scire, this
only I know, that I know nothing. The power of man
is weaknesse, all his wealth seemes to be meere beggery;
but the desires and appetites of man are infinite, and
boundlesse. So that in his greatest abundance poore
man is discontented, and much perplexed with his
owne wants. What shall I say of man? where shall hee
seeke contentment and rest? or whom shall I accuse?
for man himselfe, I finde him thus ordained by nature.
I will therefore make my complaint against nature, she
is corrupted, and hauing no true contentment in her
selfe, she will not confesse her owne basenesse, but desires

to conceale it and to delude man. And to this end
obserue her subtiltie, she giues man an infinite desire,
intimating that she hath an infinite treasure; but our
desires are therefore infinite, because wee receiue no
contentment at all, and so still wanting, still 
                     •
                  e desire.
For nature that first brought vs together, and made vs
importunate sutors, to haue the creatures in a plentiful
measure, hath on the other side, very cunningly set
such a difference and disparity betweene both, that we
shall neuer obtaine our request. As for example, man
desires wealth by his labour and industrie, together
with Gods blessing; wealth is purchased and gained,
this wealth is laid vp in the purse, the chest, or the treasure
house very safely (I confesse) but not so fitly disposed;
for the minde is still emptie, and therfore still may
desire. If I were hungrie, and that for my sake, you
would fill another mans belly, I might pine with your
charitie.
               But in the meane 
                     〈◊〉
                  , nature will excuse her selfe:
for who is the coffere
                     •
                  ? Either 
                     〈◊〉
                   your minde together
with your treasure,The disparitie betweene the obiects of the will, and the will it selfe. and locke them vp both in
your closset; or else lay vp the treasure in your minde,
and so stay your appetite. This counsell will not serue,
nature is to be blamed; for there is a disproportion betweene
both: who euer saw a bushell filled vp with
learning, or a pottle-pot stuft vp with wisedome?
Things spirituall cannot replenish materiall vessels,
neither can bodies penetrate and satisfie the desires of
a spirit. Herein consists the corruption of nature, that
she hath giuen or permitted the appetite, notwithstanding
the disparitie; either she should 
                     •
                  orbeare to desire,
or else prouide plenty and store of such condition,
as that she might be able to satisfie the request of her
sutors, who now (for want of supplie) seeme to be
meere cormorants.
               
                  
                   It is not sufficient for nature to conspire against

                     .
but she doth further practise to set the seuerall faculties
of the soule in opposition to themselues. A good wit
neuer agrees with a good memorie, I speake not in regard
of the multiplicitie of inuentions, which thereby
might seeme to ouerpresse the memorie, though commendable
and good in her selfe, but it ariseth from the
very constitution. A moist braine full of spirits is aptest
for inuention; but the cold and drie temper longest
retaines the impression. Good wits cannot agree among
themselues, but fall to banding and factions;
and the wittie professions seeme to oppose each other,
the one desiring to make the other hateful and odious,
and the other striuing to make it poore, base, and contemptible.
Sometimes you shall discerne wit without
discretion; and heere that inestimable treasure of wit,
seemes to bee wholly vnprofitable, and vnseasonable,
being committed to a fooles keeping: and here nature
makes man a wittie foole, giuing him the substance
of wit, but denying the right vse and application. Thus
doe the faculties iarre among themselues; which in effect
is as much, as if I should say, The soule did disagree
with it selfe; for the faculties are the soule, and the
soule is the faculties.
               And as it is in our selues, so likewise in others. The
wittie Poet will breake his iests on the Constable: but
here is the mischiefe, his memorie will serue him to remember
and to reuenge this iniurie and wrong. Againe,Wits are not the same in all studies.
the same wits will not suffice for all studies; the
superficiall Rhetorician with his colours &amp; Allegories,
shall neuer fadome the grounds and depth of Philosophie.
He that is naturally addicted to Mathematicall
Engines and lines, shall neuer be able to comprehend,
within the circles of his sphere, the notions and abstractions

of the Metaphysicks. Practicall arts can neuer
be attained vnto by speculation, but must bee learned
by experience. If learning be not fitted to thy capacitie,
suppose thy weake braine should be imployed in
the Metaphysicks, it will make thee a learned foole, beyond
thy selfe. And generally, the best naturall wits
can hardliest endure any painfulnes in studie, but expect
to receiue all by infusion: and lest they should
ouer boldly aduenture vpon learning, at the first entrance
they are scared away, with words of art and with
notions. If still they proceede, then much reading or
plodding duls the vnderstanding; night-watchings
and candle light, distemper the body, and dazle the
minde. On the other side, the best wits are soonest abused
and seduced, and most easily corrupted: the greatest
iudgements take the deepest discontentments, &amp;c.
               Before I can descend, from the inuisible faculties of 
the soule,The gifts of minde and body can hardly together subsist. to the apparant actions of the body, I will

shall obserue then, that nature hath set a great difference
betweene them: the fairest complection is seldome
accompanied with the best wit; women may be
proud of their beautie, but not of their wisedome. The
best temper and constitution are not the fittest for the
vnderstanding; the purest sanguine complection is apter
for daliance and loue-toyes, then for night watchings
and studies. The strongest and best compacted
limbes and ioynts, doe argue more abilitie to be admitted
of the Kings guard, then to bee sworne of his

would not suffice for the right vse and exercise of
all the seuerall faculties. The clowne for his cariage,

a forward wit; either he is already come to his last temper,
or else his climate must alter. What is it, or who is
it, that thou canst loue in nature, on whō thou might'st
settle thy affection? If faire and beautifull to fight,
Phisiognomie will tell thee that thou seest the whole
man, thou canst expect no further vse or imployment
of his seruice: if otherwise wise and deformed, how
canst thou loue him, in whom nothing seemes worthy
of thy loue? We may call thy iudgement in question;
whereas in all other creatures, the comelines, beautie,
and fit proportion of the outward limbes, signifies the
good inward conditions.
               
                  Now at length to speake of the actions of mans body,
I will giue them the same entertainment, which
formerly I did to the faculties of the soule: for as I am
not malitious,A 
                        〈◊〉
                      to the

                      of mans body. so I will not be pa
                     •
                  tiall. I doe heere accuse
and challenge all the naturall actions of mans
body, to be tainted and defiled with corruption, and in
all of them the punishment of this corruption shall manifestly
appeare. All punishments may be reduced to
these three heads: 1. Dedecus s
                        •
                     u infamia: 2. Poena seu
castigatio: 3. Ser
                        •
                     itium se
                        •
                      captiuitas. By the first, he
suffers losse in his credit, good name and reputation,
and is put to open shame and infamie. By the second,
he suffers detriment and losse in his owne flesh, or in
his owne substance and goods, being chastised according
to law. By the third, he seemes to be imprisoned,
and suffers losse in his freedom and libertie, being tied
to serue as a slaue. These are the three generall heads,
whereunto the exercise of iustice doth vsually extend
it selfe: and to these three heads, I will reduce all the
naturall actions of mans body.
               For the infamie and shame: Whatsoeuer nature desires 
to be concealed,The most naturall actions are shamefull. hidden, and dares not attempt it
in the presence of others, certainly she will neuer stand
to iustifie the action, but rather at first sight, will easily
confesse her infamie and shame. Take the most naturall
workes of man, and you shall obserue, that man is most
ashamed of them, as eating, drinking, sleeping, yawning,
&amp;c. I will not speake of the most vncleane and secret
parts, some things may bee conceiued, which may
not be spoken. Who euer held it any part of his commendation
to bee a great eater, or to sleepe while his
bones ake? Who euer went out into the open streete,
or to the market place, to take a meales meate; but rather
would prouide a close cabinet, for such necessarie
imployments of nature? Is nature ashamed of her most

naturall actions? then certainly it betokens a guiltinesse.
               But you will ascribe it to the strict and austere profession
of Christianitie, which seeming ouer proud and
haughtie for mans present estate, disdaines to inhabite
the earth,Not religion but natu
                        •
                     e makes them shamefull. lookes vp to heauen, and therefore brandeth
these actions with shame and contempt. True indeed,
of all the sects in the world, Christian religion hath alwaies
been most famous and eminent for strictnesse of
life, and mortification of flesh; which in my conscience,
as it hath formerly giuen the greatest growth to
religion; so the neglect and decay thereof, in these our
daies, will be the greatest blow to religion. But herein
I will excuse our selues: for not the Christian alone,
but the Turke and the Heathen, both say and practise
as much in effect. You will then say, that religion in
generall, agrees in this one point, as teaching all men a
maidenlike modestie, to forbeare the outragious lusts
of the flesh, and therein sets the difference betweene
man and beast, and thus along continued custome, may
at length seeme to bee nature. I cannot rest in this answere,
but I must fasten this shame immediatly vpon
nature her selfe. Obserue then not onely in man, but
likewise in the dumbe creatures: Are not those parts
which serue for excrement, or generation, concealed
and hidden either in place and situation, or else with
feathers, with haire, or some other couering, which nature
hath prouided for that purpose; in so much that
you shall hardly discerne their sexe 
                     •
                   Hath she not appointed
the shade, the groue, and the close night to couer
and hide them? she is ashamed of them, they are
vncleane to the sight; but most absurd in the speech,
and both taught vs by a naturall instinct. Wil
                     •
                   thou

                     〈◊〉
                   talke; and shall that appeare
in thy tongue, which nature hath concealed in

her basest parts? Be not so base: remember the noblenesse
of thy birth, and thy condition farr

                   aboue beasts;
stoope not so low, as to touch, or to kisse with thy lips
and thy tongue, those vncleane parts, whereof nature
her selfe is ashamed.
               The infamie of these actions shall better appeare by
this one instance. Call foorth the incestuous or adulterous
person, I will here checke and correct him. Thou
beast,Our blushing. worse then a beast, (for many beasts seeme to
obserue the Rites and sanctitie of mariage) seest thou
not how thou hast sinned against heauen, and against
thine owne soule? Doth not thine owne conscience
accuse thee? or thinkest thou that the close night, or
darknesse it selfe can couer or conceale thy sinne? &amp;c.
I haue no sooner spoken these words, but behold his
hart faints, his speech failes him, he trembles &amp; quakes,
all his blood appeares in his face; as if the blood being
guiltie to it selfe, should step foorth and either excusing
or accusing it selfe, should wholly acqu
                     ••
                   the spirit: For
I see another law in my members, rebelling against the
law of my spirit. Or as if it were naturally ingrafted in
man, that without the effusion of blood, there can be
no remission of sinnes: and therefore (as farre foorth as
the skinne will permit it) the blood desires to make
some recompence for the offence.
               Suppose I were to examine a guiltlesse innocent
man, and to charge him with such crimes which he neuer
attempted; yet sometimes there will appeare the
same tokens of modestie and shame▪
                  The innocent man will blush. Nature can be no
lier, she will neuer accuse her selfe vniustly; though she
may be innocent of this crime, yet she acknowledgeth
the roote to bee corrupted, and thereby argues a possibilitie
to commit the like offence: she will not wholly
excuse her selfe, though she de
                     •
                  ies the particular fact.
Or as if there were such a society and mariage between

sinne on the one part, and flesh and blood on the other
part, that if sin be conceiued in the heart▪ thither flocks
all the blood to helpe and further the conception. Or
if it be laid before the eyes, thither is all the blood conuaied,
to meete it, and to giue it the best entertainment.
Here is a shame, here is a confession, thou canst not be
ashamed but of thine owne act, and therefore needes
thou must acknowledge thine owne corruption: Indicio
tuo quasi sorex perijsti; Thou haddest no grace to
commit sinne, and thou shalt neuer haue grace to conceale
sinne.
               
                   Hitherto we haue only enioyned man penance, wee
haue discouered his nakednes, that so in a white sheete,
we might put him to shame. Now let vs implore, brachium
seculare,
                  Man punisheth himselfe. the temporall power, for his chastisement
and correction: I will not speake of punishment
imposed by mans law, but willingly vndertaken by nature
her selfe. Why should fearefulnesse so much possesse
man? together with a continual expectation, what
euill might befall him, were it not, that it proceedes
from a guiltinesse of conscience? How often vpon any
relation of the least mischance, do we strike our breasts,
our thighes, wring our hands, stampe on the earth, and
then suddenly looke vp to heauen, as if these outward
annoyances could not any way concerne vs, were not
the roote of this corruption within our selues? And
therefore nature seemes to punish the roote, to curse
and defie the earth, to acknowledge the guilt, together
with the iust and due vengeance of heauen.
               If any greater misfortune befalles vs, then we begin
to teare the haire, to bite the flesh, to forbeare the societies
of men, to refuse the vse of our meate, to neglect
our naturall rest, to denie all comfort to our selues,
and sometimes it proceeds vnto death. When suddenly
wee lay violent hands vpon our selues, wee desire nothing

so much as a perpetuall separation and diuorce,
betweene the soule and the flesh; like the infinite hate
of a deadly foe, who could be content to wound his
owne enemies thorough his owne sides.Sometimes mā becomes a self-homicide. No other
creature did euer murther it selfe, but onely man; for
no other creature did euer deserue it, so much as man.
You will say, that this ariseth from passions, which are
not incident to the wisest mē: but who hath such absolute
power in himself, as yt he can promise to himselfe,
staiednesse and constancie in his affections? Or is it not
a propertie of wise men, that they should alwaies call
themselues to accounts, and accuse themselues, as the
wise man saith, Sapiens est semper accusator sui. This
cannot be without a iust ground, first presuming and
presupposing an inward and secret corruption, they
are apt to suspect themselues: whereas the foolish and
ignorant conceiuing a casualtie and chance, neuer
dreame of iust iudgements. But I pray' marke the disposition
of mans body, and you shall finde that our
armes, and our hands, are fitter disposed to buffer our
selues, then to reuenge our enemies; they are bent to
our bodies, and yet we cannot embrace our selues, as
if we were our owne greatest enemies: whereas in all
other creatures, their owne hornes, their tuskes, their
clawes, &amp; their hoofes can no way offend themselues.
               I will not speake, how subiect and liable our nature
is, to many ill accidences and chances: I will passe
ouer all those diseases, which doe not arise from any
distemper or riot, but euen from the complection it
selfe, and seeme to be hereditarie to whole mankinde,
as other proper diseases are intailed to certaine families
and tribes. Old age seemes to be a continued disease,
and therefore vndoubtedly is a naturall punishment
of nature to her selfe. My second part shall 
                     〈◊〉
                  
of this subiect.
               
                  But punishments should be publike and open, both
for the example of malefactors, as likewise in natures
defence to iustifie her actions. Behold then, wee are
made a spectacle to God▪ to Angels, to men: our punishment
is therefore laid open and manifest, to God,
to Angels,The punishment of our selues appeares in our seruice of God. to men. How falles it out, that by an instinct
of nature, in all our religious worship and seruice of
God, we first begin with the punishment of our selues?
Sacrifice (I thinke) is naturall to man, that in liew of our
hearts, and for the sparing of our own blood, we should
offer vp the blood of others. Before the Law was giuen
in Mount Sinay, there was a sacrifice: for God hath imprinted
this knowledge, not onely in the Ceremoniall
law, but in nature her selfe; that both nature and law
might guide and direct vs to the sacrifice of his sonne:
so that a sacrifice is common to all nations, common
to all religions. The Heathen at this day vse in their sacrifices,
the launcing of their flesh, the spilling of their
owne blood, the scourging of their bodies, appearing
naked before their Altars. The Idolaters of old time,
how cruelly they tormented themselues, offering vp together,
with the best part of their substance, their owne
sonnes and their daughters in a bloody sacrifice? The
Iewes, how strict were they in obseruing their fasts;
how curious in their washings, putting on their hairecloth
and ashes? The Christian in his seruice of God,
prepares himselfe with inward mortification and outward
ceremonies; the one serues as a potion of bitternesse,
to purge his inward vncleannesse; the other as
a plaister or salue to couer his vlcer, as truly acknowledging
that inwardly and outwardly, wee are wholly
corrupted: and therefore both tend to edification.
               For the Angels, there are two sorts of them, either
good or bad: but we scarce heare any mention of the
good Angels, of our guardian Angels; for so Scripture

saith, God hath giuen his Angels charge ouer vs;
and Angels are appointed as Gods messengers for our
ministerie. If any extraordinary good doe befall vs, we
will rather choake it vp with vnthankfulnesse,How our punishment appeares in respect of the Angels. or attribute
it to some secret and hidden cause in nature, sometimes
to a meere casualtie and chaunce, rather then we
will ascribe it to them; as being guiltie to our selues,
that through our sinnes and corruptions, wee doe not
deserue mercie and compassion, but iudgement and
vengeance. Whereas on the contrary, for those euill
spirits, the firebrands and instruments of Gods wrath,
these are they which wee feare; vpon euery occasion

                  ers, which

spirits; and more are suspected to be of this confederacie

                  e
to our selues, that wee deserue nothing but vengeance:
and generally (these bad spirits) they are the tempters
and tormentors of whole mankinde. And thus we
seeme to bee ignorant and wholly vnacquainted with
the instruments of Gods mercie; but are daily frighted
and astonied, and indeed much perplexed and endamaged
by them, who are appointed for the execution of
his iustice: as if we did rather conuerse with them, then
with Angels of light, which doth surely argue the fall
and corruption of man.
               How this punishment of nature, and of man himself,
appeares vnto man; take our ordinarie salutations.
Wherefore should I in due respect to my superiour,How the punishment of our selues appeares to our selues. to
signifie the honour and the reuerence, which I beare
him, vncouer my head, and bend my selfe, my knees to
the ground, my body to my knees; were 
                     〈◊〉
                   not, that
therein I acknowledge the humblenesse of mine owne

minde; and doe prostrate my body, accusing 
                     〈…〉
                  
roote, and the fountaine of my pride and rebellion?
Do you yet require some further testimonie of my seruice?
Then in the salutation, I kisse my hand, as it were
taking a corporall oath, signifying and assuring you,
that whatsoeuer I shall promise you with my lips, I
shall be ready to execute and put in practise with my
hands, vsing the best meanes that I can to secure you
of my seruice; still supposing my inward falsehood,
and that you haue iust cause to distrust me; considering
my rebellious nature and inbred corruption. Thus
to honour God, to honour our superiours, we must dishonour
our selues, punish our owne flesh, vncouer our
parts, bend our selues in subiection. Which were it not
mans voluntarie punishment of his owne disobedience
and sinne, it could not stand with the ordinarie iustice
of nature, or the high dignitie of his condition.
               
                   Now that I haue spoken of his shame and his punishment,
let his bondage and slauerie appeare; and so
at length I will end,The imprisonment of the soule. hauing first committed him to sure
hold and safe custodie. Our soule is imprisoned within
our flesh, why should she not bee at libertie, for her
flight and free passage out of this body, that she might
goe and returne at her pleasure, as she is in all other her
actions? Is there any substance (neither flesh nor spirit,
but betweene both) which might serue to chaine
and vnite in one linck, these different natures together?
Or why should this priuiledge be denied man, that in
regard of his spirit, he might conuerse with the Angels;
as in regard of his flesh, he partakes with the beasts? Is
he not here abridged and barred of his good companie
and societie? Suppose man were dismembred and
had lost some of his limbes; seemes not the soule to be
heere contracted within her selfe, lodged in a lesse
roome, as it were kept close prisoner, notwithstanding

that she retaines all her faculties whole and entire, in
as large and ample manner, as she did, when the bodie
was sound and per
                     •
                  it, hauing not receiued them from
the bodie, and therefore not lost them together with
the bodie; which cannot bee said of the sensitiue
soule.
               To come to the materiall actions of his body, all the
honest vocations and callings of men, what are they in
veritie and truth,The slaueries of men. but only seruices and slaueries? Euery
sea-faring man seemes to be a galley-slaue; euery
occupation seemes a meere drudgerie, the very beasts
themselues doe not suffer the like. What a dangerous
and painfull labour it is to worke in repairing of sea-bankes;
some are ouerwhelmed with waters, others
dye surfetted with cold, the very night must giue no
rest to their labours? How many haue miscarried vnder
vaults, in working of mines, in digging of coale-pits,
casting vp of sand, or of grauell, how many haue been
buried vp quick and aliue? How many haue falne from
the tops of high buildings, from scaffolds and ladders;
if some Carpenters and Masons proue old men, yet
how many shall you finde not decrepit or troubled
with bruses, with aches and sores? How many trades
are noysome, vnfit for mans health? I haue knowne a
Student in Cambridge, only in the course of his profession,
troubled with fiue dangerous diseases at once.
How many trades are base and ignoble, not befitting
the dignitie of mans condition, as Coblers, Tinkers,
Carters, Chimney-sweepers? But hearke, hearke, me
thinkes all the Cries of London, doe not so truly informe
me, what they sell, or what I should buy, as they
doe proclaime and crie their owne miserie. Consider,
consider, whether any other creature could endure the
like seruice; and yet this is no prentiship, that euer we
should expect any better condition, but the whole

time of our life must bee spent in this slauerie. It is a
truth, which will admit no exception, and therefore I
will forbeare to make any further complaint; onely
mans nature is corrupted, mans nature is corrupted:
and therefore with patience we must endure the yoke,
no longer sonnes of a louing mother, but seruants and
slaues to a stepdame.
               I could be infinite in these poynts: but calling to
minde that I haue proceeded in a legall course, according
to the forme of law, I haue impaneld my Iurie
consisting of twel
                     •
                  e reasons,The summe of all the former reasons. I will vse no shifts or delaies,
but referre my selfe to their verdict. I will heere
onely rehearse, and briefly recapitulate, the summe of
my proofes; considering that in the very constitution
of man, many things happen, beyond the common
course of nature, without president or patterne, such as
could not stand with the diuine prouidence, were it
not, that they are the particular punishments of mans
sinne. As for example: 1. That parts of such different
condition, the spirit with the flesh, mortall with immortall,
should together subsist. 2. That the soule being
coupled, should finde such meane and base entertainment.
3. That notwithstanding the contract, there
should be a continuall disagreement &amp; opposition between
both. 4. That there should be no manner of subordination
or subiectiō, such as were requisite in parts,
for the vnitie of one person. 5. That being thus parts
of one man, yet they should not bee acquainted with
each other, but haue actions, priuate and proper to
themselues. 6. That the bodie should hinder euery action
of the soule, the senses faliely informing and distracting
the vnderstanding. 7. The will deluded with
showes, vaine hopes, false promises, receiuing no manner
of contentment. 8. The body secretly and cunningly
co
                     •
                  spires with the faculties of the soule, to set a

faction and opposition betweene them. 9. That the
comelinesse of parts, the gifts of the body, will not together
accompanie the gifts of the minde; but are estranged
from each other, and that all the actions of
the bodie either betoken 10, shame, 11, or punishment,
12, or slauerie. Let these allegations bee duly
examined, and I doe not feare to come to a triall: for I
doe here call heauen and earth to witnesse, that these
things cannot stand with the wisedome of nature, the
goodnesse of nature; neither haue they conformitie to
the rest of the workes of nature: and therefore they
serue as an extraordinary punishment, for some offence
vndoubtedly, signifying the fall and corruption
of man. And thus much for the very person
of man, together with his parts
and constitution.
               Deo gratias.
            
         
         
            
            THE FALL
OF MAN.
            THE SECOND PART.
            
               AS in great buildings intended▪ all things
cannot easily bee discerned in the platforme;
it lieth not in the power of mans
wisedome, art, or prouidence, to preuent
all errors: some faults will escape, which
by vse and continuance of time, will better appeare and
discouer themselues:Man in himselfe, and in comparison to the creatures. so is it in the consideration of
man, which consists not only in mans constitution, and
the view of his seuerall parts, but likewise in respect of
other creatures, his goods, or his substance, and whatsoeuer
else may befall him: for euery thing in nature
presents it selfe, not only in it selfe, but likewise in reference
&amp; proportion to others. Thus it is with a Prince
or a subiect, who must haue an eye, both to his owne
estate in particular, and vpon what grounds &amp; tearmes
he stands with his bordering neighbours. Now giue
me leaue, hauing thus safely lodged man, to take some
further account of his life, &amp; of his actions: I will speak
of his miseries in himselfe, and in comparison with the
rest of the creatures.
            
               Before I dare presume to speake of our miseries. I
must first apologize for my selfe, lest in a blinde deuotion

I might chance to offend, and seeking to draw others
vnto God, I my selfe might fall from God. Blessed

miseries, thy goodnesse may better appeare, hauing first

meanes and occasions may be offered, with feare and trembling
to work out our saluation. Here is my intent, O Lord,
and this thou knowest right well, for thou seest my thoughts
long before they are hatched: forgiue me the

               se my labours; let thy power appeare in my weakenesse,
thy glorie in my shame. Amen. Hauing thus made
my peace with God, I will now fall to my intended
taske.
            
            My second kinde of arguments seemes to be built
vpon these three grounds and foundations: 1. The
mercie of God doth ouerflow all his works, and all his
attributes, like oyle vpon liquours. This is plaine, for
mercie begins his actions;Mercie begins Gods actions. God workes vpon nothing,
therefore nothing could moue him to worke, but his

mercie. Now if all things in man did 
                  •
               auour of mercy,
it were a strong presumption, that the same mercie still
discouers her selfe, in the continuance, which did first
appeare in the creation: but if otherwise you discerne
miseries and afflictions in man, acknowledge the fruits
of Gods iustice, iustice, which must necessarily presuppose
some offence; or else could admit no difference,
nor be distinguished from wrong and oppression. Now
iustice supposing an offence, could neuer begin the action;
for we could not offend, when as yet we were not:
and therefore acknowledge that the fruites of Gods
iustice, together with mans transgressions, are both
twinnes, borne in one instant, or at least producing
each other, and standing in a mutuall and reciprocall
relation to each other; the offence to the guilt, the guilt
to the punishment. So that the punishment is not equall
in time to the production of man; first wee were
existing, before we were punished.
            Especially considering, that Gods intent in the creation,
was onely according to the nature of goodnesse,
(vt sit communicatina sui ipsius) to impart his owne being
and attributes to the creatures:Miseries are the fruites of iustice. but when I finde
sorrowes and griefes in man, I begin to enquire, where
is the originall? for in God there is no sorrow, no
griefe, no maladies, no afflictions, no diseases, no
death: God did only desire to impart himselfe; whence
proceedes the malignitie? were it not, that some after-corruption
hath stained mans nature. The good wheate
was first sowen, then came the ill husbandman, qui super-seminauit
zizania, who did abuse the freedome of
his owne will to his owne shame, chusing rather to die,
then to liue. And here the thistle and cockle first began
to appeare, making man, the creature of Gods mercie,
the fauourite of those times (as I may so speak), the obiect
of Gods iustice, the subiect of Gods punishment.
            
               My second ground is this: If miseries incident to
our nature do befall vs in such number, and measure, as
that they do 
                  •
               arre exceed all our own ioyes; in so much
that our nature seemes to be ouerprest with their burthen
and weight, and that our conditiō should be farre
better,Our miseries doe exceed all our ioyes. not to bee, then to bee: then certainly the state
and condition of man is cleane altered and changed
from the first institution thereof. For it could not stand
with the act of creation, or the goodnesse of the Deity,
to make of nothing, that, which in effect is worse then
nothing: So God should descend lower then himselfe,
not perfiting, but confounding the creatures; and that
nothing, which was before the creation, should not only
beare comparison, but likewise be preferd before the
state of some creatures. Now indeede the thought of
mans miseries, here in the course of this life, seemed of
that moment to the ancient and heathen Philosophers,
that it was generally held and concluded among them,
for a truth, that melius est non nasci, quàm nasci; it were
better not to be borne, then to be borne: So that a wise
man might be excluded from sorrow, he would neuer
thirst after ioy; to be dead, we regard it not, but to dye,
here is the torment.
            For the beleeuing man and the true Christian, who
(besides the miseries of this life, which he acknowledgeth
to be the rod of Gods wrath,The miseries of a Christian man. for the punishment
of sinne) is likewise perplexed with the feare and terror
of hell, where that rod shall bee turned to a serpent.
How many of them haue cursed the day of their birth?
How earnestly haue others besought their speedy dissolution?
Doth not Christ witnesse of that sonne of perdition,
that it were better for him, if he had neuer been
borne; or that a milstone were chained to his neck, and
both cast into the bottomlesse Sea? Is this a priuate and
particular case, and doth it only concerne Iudas? Is not

the number of the elect very small, while whole troupes
and infinite multitudes of reprobates (though neuer so
bold and confident of their owne righteousnesse) are
daily reiected? And in the elect people of God, what
strange agonies and conflicts appeare betweene the
flesh and the spirit? Doth not the way to heauen lie by
the gates of hell, when men with feare and trembling
must worke out their owne saluation? If the righteous
shall scarce answere one for a thousand, where shall the
vngodly and sinner appeare?
            My third ground is this: Certaine it is that the heauens
were ordained for man, and for man alone the
whole earth was created. Now supposing all other
things to be directed for man,Mans miseries are g
                     •
                  eater thē the beasts. the state and condition
of man (according to right reason) should farre excell
theirs, as in worth and dignitie, so in true ioy and all
manner of contentment; nature should be more bountifull
and beneficiall to man, then to the rest of the creatures.
As for example, in a house consisting of master
and seruants, if plentie, case, and contentment can bee
found vnder the roofe of that house, you will conceiue
it in the masters person, and not in the seruants: otherwise
you will suppose, a very preposterous order, that
things are not as they ought to be disposed; and that it
is some particular grieuance, for some particular occasion:
and thus it befalles man.
            Doe you doubt, whether the creatures were ordained
onely for mans vse? I will not conuince you with
reason, I could wish that you would forbeare the vse of
the creatures; doe not commit theft, defile not your
hands with blood; for in truth you haue no right vnto
them, if they were not appointed for your seruice. But
for this one time we will acquire you:The beast
                     •
                   
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   fo
                     •
                   man. See you not how
their skinnes serue for our clothing; their ca
                  •
               kasses for
our foode, or inward liuing; their strength for our labour,

some of them for our sports and delights, some
for necessitie; they haue no more strength or knowl
                  •
               dge,
then is fit for our seruice, and vse: the horse can
make choice of his foode, learnes his pace, remembers
his way; and for his strength, it serues onely as a dull
instrument, to be moued by others. But God herein
deales with other creatures, as politike and practising
states-men deale with their seruants; who desire to be
attended by such, and of such kinde; who are either
pages for age, or otherwise honest good men, who
know better how to obserue the condition of seruants,
then to prie into the secrecies and counsels of their
masters.
            Now suppose, that the very same miseries both for
number and qualitie, were alike incident to man and
to beast; yet mans miserie were to be reputed much
greater,Their miseries are together compared. in regard of his personage, his dignitie and
condition. If you strike or wrong a gentleman, the
offence is much greater, then if it were done to a
clowne or a seruant: but considering that mans body
is much more tender then theirs, of a more excellent
constitution, and therefore more sensible of wrongs;
assuredly the paine and the torment, which he suffers
in those miseries, is farre greater then theirs. A wound
in the eye doth much more torment man, then in the
hand or the foote, but most especially considering the
pride and haughtinesse of his owne minde, hauing a
truer feeling, and a stronger apprehension of his owne
wrongs, that when the smart is once past in the skinne,
or in the flesh; yet still the thorne seemes to take deepe
hold in the braine. And thus man disquiets himselfe
with his owne thoughts, that he should be thus dealt
withall, perplexed and tormented like a slaue; that it
should not bee in his power to preuent the like mischiefe,
but he must lie open and naked to all dangers;

he must stand vpon his guard, yet like a disarmed and
weaponlesse man, must wholly commit himselfe to
their mercie: these very thoughts, as they come neerest
the heart, so are they a farre greater corrasiue, then the
wounds in the flesh. But I will spare my selfe all this
labour; for I will not speake much of those miseries,
which are common to both; but onely of such as are
proper and peculiar to man, and therein wee seeme to
exceed them by many degrees.
            Thus briefly in effect, considering that many miseries
are incident to man, contrary to the first intent of
our creation,The summe of these three grounds. which was a worke onely of mercie: considering
the large extent of our miseries, which seeme
to ouerpoyse all the rest of our blessings, contrary to
the rule of iustice, if punishment doe not first presuppose
an offence; and contrary to the nature of the Deitie,
which being nothing but happinesse, should therefore
impart nothing but happinesse, vnlesse our deserts
shall otherwise require: considering (I say) how many
miseries doe befall man, common to other creatures,
man, who is exempted from the ordinary ranke, and
condition of other creatures: considering againe, how
many punishments are proper and peculiar to man (as
if nature were more mercifull to other creatures then
vnto man) notwithstanding the high dignitie, and prerogatiue
of his state and condition: I hope the fall and
corruption of man, shall hereby sufficiently appeare,
euen to the blindnes and darknes of our naturall reason,
without any further reuelation of grace; mans own
reason shal discouer his fall, being no way taught or instructed
herein, by the light &amp; direction of Gods spirit.
            These are the three grounds, which seeme rather as
seuerall degrees of one and the same foundation, which
is laid vp and buried in the tombe of our miseries: and
therefore I pray' pardon me, if I be not ouer strict and

curious in my method,He excuseth his method. though I speake promiscuously,
and confound them together: for miserie betokens
confusion. A confused stile, and a disturbed method, is
fittest to discourse of our miserie, which cannot consist
with the right vse of our reason, or vnderstanding. In
stead of an eloquent phrase, or a learned discourse, if I
shall vse sighes, teares, sobbes and complaints, thereby
to moue your compassion, this would proue the best
lecture of miserie. And if I shall lay open your selues to
your selues, and that my tongue shall serue, as a glasse
to discouer your miserie; in stead of the foote and burthen
of my speech, at the clause of a sentence, I pray'
vse this short eiaculation and prayer, Iesu fili Dauid
miserere nostri: According to our miserie extend thy
mercie (sweete Iesu), clothe our nakednesse, couer our
shame, heale our infirmities; for thou art our house of
defence and our castle.
            In the numbring of our miseries, I must here exclude
such as are especially and principally related in Scripture,
for I will reserue my selfe to speake seuerally of
them in the third part. Now if I shall twice repeate any
onething, then you must conceiue that it is proper to
miserie, and to miserable men, to spend their whole
time in telling and retelling one and the same ill accident.
For their heart is replenished with sorrow, and
out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh;
considering that my condition is the same with others,
and speaking of them, I speake of my selfe: yet here in
deede I am but a bare reporter; neither would I bethought
to bee a counterfeit, the more to moue your
pitie and compassion; nor doe I desire long to detaine
you with vaine and needlesse repetitions: May it therefore
please you, to consider the difference in handling
each miserie, and you shall likewise easily obserue the
different narration.
            
               Speaking of mans miseries, I will begin with mans
first beginning or birth. Man only (besides his naturall
birth) is conceiued in sinne, and death is the wages of
sinne;The miserie of his birth. sometimes the wombe prooues likewise his
tombe; and sometimes in his birth (being of a viperous
kinde) hee proues a murtherer, and causeth her death,
which first gaue him life: comming out of the wombs
prison, occisipotius quàm nati imaginem gerit, he carries
the image rather of a flaine and a murthered man,
then of a man newly borne, for he is borne with the effusion
of blood. And being thus borne, hee is not set at
libertie, but foorthwith carried to the place of his torments,
and execution; and as hee came, so shall hee returne,
borne with sorrow and griefe, he shall dye with
paine and lamentation. He is carried (I confesse) not
on the hurdle, but first in the armes, then in the cradle,
it may be in a coach, sometimes in a chariot; but certainly
at length it will be a coffin: sleeping or waking,
be the waies neuer so many, neuer so different, neuer so
crooked, yet still he is carried on his iourney; howsoeuer
the winde blowes, the tide will carrie his vessell.
Our life is a kind of dying; for when it is gone, then we
are dead: the wine is in spending, when first it is broached;
then wee begin to dye, when f
                  ••
               st wee begin to
liue. Looke vpon me, looke vpon me (beloued), I am
more then halfe dead; in truth, in truth, I am more then
halfe dead.
            Me thinkes I see some compassionate men calling
for hot waters, fearing lest I should suddenly faint. I
doe humbly thanke them for their loues; but I will
spare them that labour, for I am not wounded, I confesse;
I hope, I am not poyso
                  •
               ed; I know no dangerous
disease that lurkes in my body,Li
                     ••
                  ing we dye. vnlesse you will suppose
mine owne nature, which indeed is corrupted, and
therefore tends to corruption; yet in truth I am more

then halfe dead. Others conceiue this, as spoken in
regard of the great difference, betweene my dull and
dea
                  •
                flesh, and my quickning spirit; or else in regard
of the diuersitie of elements, whereof some are actiue
and betoken life; others passiue and betoken death.
Alas, alas, I doe not loue that any one, with his subtilty
and tricks of Logicke, should play with my miseries;
in truth, in truth, I am more then halfe dead: for heere
is my death, my infancie is dead vnto me; my youth is
dead vnto me; the ripenesse and fulnesse of my age is
dead vnto me; that which remaines, it is the worst part
of my age, the dregges of my age, wherein I can expect
nothing, but sorrow, griefe, and vexation.
            Thus man at his first comming into this world, incurres
the penaltie of a flatute, statutum est hominibus
mori; no sooner hee comes, but presently hee must prepare
to returne. He is the sole pilgrime and stranger,
and all other creatures are the natiue inhabitants; hee
hath no terme of yeeres assigned him by lease, and if
hee liues out the full scope of his time, yet when hee
hath once attained old age,The account of his life. and then can best iudge of
the time past, as hauing had it once in possession; all
his whole life seemes like the dreame of a shadow, as
a tale that is told, as yesterday; though to others it
may seeme a long time, as all things seeme great in expectation.
And of his age, let him cast vp his accounts,
and deduct the time of his infancie, the times of his
sleepe, the times of his sicknesse, and other times of
his sorrow and griefe; and he shall finde, that the least
part of his age hath past with any contentment.
            But why should I speake of the course of his life,
when seldome or neuer hee attaines to that period
which nature hath appoynted; rising by degrees,The shortnes and vncertaintie of his life. and
falling againe by the same steps and degrees, according
to a iust rule and proportion? And this is most

common and vsuall, as in plants, and in trees, so in the
dumbe beasts, if you will exempt them from mans crueltie
and slaughter. But for the life of man, here is the
greatest vncertaintie; we are outwardly and inwardly
euery way assaulted, and sometimes our life is dissolued
with a poysonous breath, without any thunder-bolt,
or cannon-shot: and marueile not, for wee consist of
the earth, and the earth is soone scattered and easily
dissolued with the winde. Clockes and instruments of
iron are alwaies out of square, and still want mending.
I doe much wonder, how mans body lasteth so long,
were not the same mercie and goodnesse of God in the
continuance, which did first appeare in the creation:
and yet vpon so weake a foundation, as is the life of
man, wee build vp huge towers, and conceiue great
mountaines in our imagination.
            Assoone as man comes into the world, he begins to
discouer his nakednesse and impotencie; he is not able
to goe, not able to speake, he can neither helpe himself,
nor desire the helpe of another: only his trade is, not to
sing,His weakenes in his birth. but to crie, thereby to testifie his miserable state
and condition. Whereas all other creatures are no sooner
brought foorth, but are likewise apparelled by nature:
as she giues them their foode, so likewise she prouides
them a liuerie; some a strong hide, others a warme
fleece; the fowles of the ayre she deckes with soft feathers,
wrought about with diuers colours: to the
plants and the trees she giues a rinde and beautifull
leaues. These are all apparelled by nature, and that in a
much more sumptuous manner then man; for Salomon
in all his roabes, was not to bee compared to one of the
lilies of the field.
            All other creatures are borne with weapons, both
offensiue, as hornes, hooffes, tuskes, clawes; or defensiue,
as swift slight, a skill and subtiltie to hide it selfe, a

strong hide;Man is weaponlesse, onely man, though most obnoxious to
dangers, yet wants both. Which vndoubtedly argues a
guiltinesse in vs, an innocencie in them: for howsoeuer
the dumbe creatures groane vnder the burthen of sin,
yet is it vnder the burthen of mans sinne.
            All other creatures are fed from aboue, God feedes
the Rauens from heauen, and nature makes their
prouision; in the first houre of their birth, they seeke
their portion of victual; without any guide or direction
they know the way to the teate, and thus they are able
to helpe themselues.He wants more helpe then the beasts. Only man wants a keeper, or a
nurse, to hold him vp in her armes, left hee should bee
stroken dead with his first fall; then must he be held to
the breast, wrapt vp in swadling clouts, laid in a cradle:
for of himselfe he hath no meanes to preserue himselfe,
but would vndoubtedly perish, if the same mercie of
God, which first appeared in the wombe, did not stirre
vp pitie and compassion in our tender hearted parents,
to take the care and charge ouer vs. And thus is man, in
his birth impotent, and in his age hee seemes to be the
day labourer; a very drudge vpon earth, in s
                     •
                  dore vultus
eating the bread of carefulnesse, and drinking the
cup of sorrow.
            All other creatures, if they haue a sufficient quantity
of foode, will vndoubtedly thriue, their profit will be
answerable to their keeping. The Sheepheard or the
Grazier will almost assure himselfe, that against such a
day, his sheepe or his oxen will be fit for the shambles;
onely man seemes not to liue by bread alone.Beasts thriue better with their food then man. For notwithstanding
a good diet, a hungrie appetite, a large
meale; yet sometimes the body pines for want of nourishment.
A good complection, and a strong constitution,
are not alwaies the vndoubted tokens of the largest
and best diet: the rich men of this world, can testifie
this, though they haue choice of good meates, multitudes

of dishes, and varietie of exquisite sauces to
prouoke their appetite; yet for the most part, they haue
not the strongest bodies, the ablest constitutions, the
longest liues, or the greatest succession of issue: it is not
bread alone that nourisheth, but the vertue and power
which God imparts vnto bread. And howsoeuer God
doth ordinarily concurre with his second causes; yet
in man, in whom Gods prouidence doth most eminently
appeare, sometimes to the wonder and astonishment
of the Physitian and Naturalist, God denies his
influence, that notwithstanding the application of outward
meanes and remedies; yet the successe, beyond all
probabilitie, proues contrary to mans expectation.
            Other creatures excell man in euery sense, in euery
corporeal qualitie, as length of yeeres, strength, soundnes
of constitution,The beasts excell man. quicknes, actiuitie; man cannot be
so subtill and ingenuous to insnare thē, but they are as
cunning and wittie to preuent vs; you may assoone surprise
and conquer a State, as preuaile against them in
this kinde. Witnesse many kingdomes and prouinces,
wherein the forme of gouernment hath often been
changed and altered, yet could they neuer preuaile against
the crueltie of wilde beasts: though the English
forces haue often put to flight the incursions and rebellions
of the Irish nation, yet for their Wolues wee
could neuer preuaile. I speake not of their aptnesse in
learning, which I haue seene wonderfull in horses, and
in other creatures, for this I might ascribe in some sort
to their teacher: but I speake of their naturall workes;
the birds in building their nests, with straw in their bils,
water in their wings &amp; earth in their clawes, may serue
to teach and instruct vs in our architecture, in the plotforme
and contriuing of our houses.
            No creature so much loathes vncleannesse as man,
and yet no creature, whose flesh is so apt to be tainted,

with vlcers, botches, and sores, as is the skinne of man;
what kembing? what trimming? what oyntments?
what washings? what sweete perfumes? what linnen?
what change of garments? and yet all will not serue:
sometimes the food breakes out into sores;The vncleannesse of man. sometimes
the moysture or fleame is dissolued into issues. By the
sea-side, you shall not faile to haue lepers; and in the
inland-countries men are troubled with botches and
scurfe. Ireland is plentiful of vermine, and the least neglect
of our bodies will make them noysome and vncleane.

            From the altar of sweete odours, let vs come to their
quier: Hearke, hearke, the excellent notes of singing

birds,The musicke of the creatures. what varietie of voyces? how are they fitted to
euery passion? The little chirping birds (the Wren, and
the Robin) they sing a meane; the Gold

they ioyne in the treble; the Blacke bird, the
Thrush, they beare the tenour; while the foure footed
beasts with their bleating and bellowing they sing a
base. How other birds sing in their order, I referre you
to the skilfull Musitians: some of them keepe their due
times; others haue their continued notes, that al might
please with varietie: while the woods, the groues, and
the rocks, with a hollownesse of their sound, like a musicall
instrument, sends foorth an eccho, and seemes to
vnite their song. Only man, as being a wild and a fierce
creature, hath no certaine note or tune; his painfulnes
in learning shal recompence his delight in the hearing;
his instruments are the guts of dead creatures, a token
of his crueltie, and the remainder of his riot. With these
instruments he must please himselfe in his melancholie
fits, take his recreation, temper his passions, and vse thē
as a meanes to kindle his deuotion: O praise God vpon
the Lute and Harpe, prais
                     •
                   him in the sound of the Trumpet,
praise him in the Cymbals and pipes; let euerie thing
that hath breath praise the Lord. And thus man seemes
to be defectiue and destitute aboue all other creatures,
euen in that, which was the first end and scope of his
creation.
            If you regard neither sweete odours, nor heauenly
musicke, nor beautifull colours; yet consider the creatures
in themselues:The temperance of the creatures. all other creatures (yea the most
rauenous) seeme to be much more temperate in their
diet, or foode, then is man. Sometimes, indeede, these
home-bred creatures, through mans ill vsage, either in
their excessiue labour, or through their distempered
foode or waters, are subiect to surfeits: but for those
wilde beasts, which do not commit themselues to mans

custodie, they are priuiledged, and exempted as from
all riots, so from all surfeits; notwithstanding the abundance
and plenty of their foode, especially at some seasons.
And here appeares our corruption, no creature so
inclined and apt for a riot; no creature so subiect to a
surfeit, and all our diseases, for the most part, arising
from a surfeit: intimating the first gluttonie and surfeit
of mankinde, in eating the forbidden fruite. Herein appeares
our corruptiō aboue theirs: either nature should
haue dieted vs, as she doth the rest of the creatures; or
else she should haue prescribed vs a measure, and giuen
vs that prouidence to moderate our selues.
            As it is in their diet, so in all other actions of the
flesh. Other creatures, though hotter in constitution,
yet are they not so much inclined to their lust, as is
man. And sometimes the more impotent man, the more
inclined to the sinne;Man more inclined to his lust. the sinne it selfe not arising from
the strong constitution, or the abundance of seede: but
from some outward temptation, or by a strong inward
apprehension in the pha

the remedie and cure of this sinne, there is not onely
prescribed vnto vs, fasting, but prayer; not onely the
flesh is to be tempered and allaied with abstinence, but
the minde distracted with worldly thoughts, must conuerse
with God and his Angels; that so inamoured with
their beautie, we might forsake our first loue, the loue
of this world, the loue of the flesh, the loue of our

            To speake of the 
                  •
               oode both of man and of beasts,

how nature hath supplied their necessities with the
daintinesse and delicacie of meates; I will not compar
                  •
               
the best of the one with the meanest of the other:The food both of man and beast. for
vndoubtedly a Ladies whelpe, or a singing bird in the
cage, are more daintily kept then a poore mans childe.
The Hounds eate vp the best part of the venison, and
the Hawkes feede vpon Partridge, while the poore
Dutch men, like swine, digge vp the rootes; and the
gentleman-like Italian (notwithstanding his brauerie,
and his picking of teeth) feeds vpon Sallads. The poore
people of England are vsually kept with their oates,
which here we giue to our horses; and if their meanes
will reach, they feed vpon milch-meates (which indeed
is their ordinarie food), doe not calues and lambes do
the like? Doth not the Bee feede vpon the sweete honeycombe?
Or is there any delicious tree in our gardens,
whereof the fowles of the ayre doe not share in
the fruite? The Kite preyes vpon Chickens, the Wolfe
vpon the tender Lambe, and the Kid; the Foxe vpon
poultrie: and I thinke that Purueiours could hardly
make better prouision for a Prince his diet. If there
were any difference, yet certainly their foode is as agreeable
to their nature, as pleasant and delicious to
them, as ours is to vs; we reiect theirs, they reiect ours.
All men are not delighted with sweete meates, the
same taste is not alike pleasing to euery palat; nature
makes their prouision agreeable to their state and condition,
and therein seemes to bee alike bountifull both
to man and to beast: Aperis tu manum tuam, &amp; impl

                   animal benedictione; Thou openest thy hand, O
Lord, and fillest euery liuing thing with thy blessings.
            Hauing receiued their foode, assuredly their digestion
is much better then ours: nature seemes lesse to
complaine in them, then in vs, and more rarely commits
an error. For as it is in trees and in plants, which

drawing sappe by the roote, doe yeerely in the spring
time send foorth a blossome, then a leafe, then the fruit,
and at length brings all to full ripenes, obseruing the
iust time and seasons for euery action.The concoctions of the beasts are more perfit thē ours. So is it in the
feeding of dumbe creatures; they seeme to keepe the
same station, the same course; at the same houres they
alwaies approch to the same places, either for water, or
shade, or for ease; iust at the same time they alwaies
betake themselues to their rest, or their sleepe. See here
an excellent diet, these are singular meanes to preserue
health; nature seemes to haue set vp a clock, and
in an equall distance by euen paces, to performe her
office and dutie. Doe you yet require some further experiment?
I will sooner breake your sleepe, then that
you should rest vnsatisfied. Hearke, hearke, in the dead
night the Cock crowes, and points out the time; Gallus
negantes arguit; gallus iacentes excitat: He calles
the husbandman to his labour, the scholler to his studie,
and alwaies serues for a watch to giue an alarum.
Philosophie can assigne no other reason of his crying,
but onely the seuerall degrees and the strict order obserued
in his concoction; nature hauing finished her
taske, presently he awakens, then immediatly out of
his braue courage, hauing receiued strength from his
rest, he begins to insult, while others will answere his
challenge, and here seemes to be a peale of ordinance;
while the cold night, and some raw humours yet vndigested,
shall bring them to a second rest, and inforce
a silence. And thus it falles out, thorough the whole
course of the night; gallicinium, the Cocke crowing
seldome deceiues vs, onely in the change of weather,
you shall obserue a change in their naturall actions.
            Being thus temperate in their diet, and their foode
agreeable to their nature, and their nature performing
her taske, no marueile if they be lesse subiect 
                  〈◊〉
                distempers,

then man;The dumbe beasts lesse subiect to distempers then man. distempers, I say, which are the forerunners
to diseases (for as yet I will not extend my
speech to diseases) from whence ariseth all this distemper
of our bodies, especially of ours, more then of all
the rest of the creatures? You will say, from the excellencie
of our constitution. But how doth this appeare?
Other creatures haue their senses more exquisite, for
they can discerne the change and alteration of weather;
if any one man can doe the like, it is to his paine
and his torment: some old ach, or brused sore, or crazie
bones may make him prouident and wise to his
sorrow. You will say, that man cannot so well intend
the actions of his sense, as they, in regard of his other
imployments, being taken vp with the weightier affaires
of his reasonable soule. But suppose that man
should turne beast, and proue an hireling onely for the
seruice of his senses: suppose him an ideot, or a lunaticke;
could hee then attaine to the least part of this
knowledge? No certainly, the old shepheard (after
long obseruation) cannot informe himselfe in this
kinde, but still must bee instructed and taught by his
flocke: this should argue, as perfect a temper in them,
as in vs.
            But suppose mans temper to bee the best, then there
appeares the corruption of nature, to make the best the
most brittle. Suppose this best temper did consist in a
mediocritie, as indeede it doth, then should it be lesse
obnoxious to any extreame;Mans temper. it should bee able to resist
as the biting frost, so the melting heate, moderata durant;
as in factions and parts taking, the safest and surest
course is, not to intermeddle with either side, vnlesse
necessitie inforceth vs, but to stand indifferently
affected to both. The moderate mixture of gold, giues
it the greatest and longest continuance, while other
bodies approching neerer the extreames, are either

nipt with the frost, or scorched with the heate, or suddenly
dissolued by the application of some contrarie
qualitie.
            I cannot yet bee resolued, from whence come all
these distempers more incident to man, then to all other
creatures: the parts of man are the same, for number,
qualitie, figure, situation, with other creatures.
Mans foode,The meanes for mās health cannot preserue him. clothing, habitation, places of rest, and recreation,
seeme to be much better then theirs, being all
in mans owne choice, who will vndoubtedly make
choice of the best: the means for preseruing his health,
are much greater then theirs; in heate hee can vse the
shade, the groue, and the sellar; in cold, the fire, the
lambe-skinne, the warme broths, besides all the helpes
of physicke, the studies of many learned men, the practise
and experience of all ages, the farre fetched Indian
drugges, and all the remedies of art; yet all will not
serue; no creature so subiect, no state so obnoxious to
all distempers, as man. It should seeme wee liue vpon
the borders, betweene God and the creatures, and
therefore these maladies, by God inflicted on nature,
must first seaze and light vpon vs: or we alone hauing
tasted the forbidden fruite, the raw humours are still
indigested, they lie heauie on the stomacke; the stomacke
which serues for our kitchin, and is the well-spring
of all our diseases.
            The many distempers which happen to man, seeme
to shorten his age, which indeed carries not the same
proportion with the age and life of the creatures. One
and twentie yeeres passe,The course of mans age. when wee liue vnder the custodie,
and tuition of others, not able to dispose of our
selues. Hitherto wee are in the cradle: now triple this
time, and it will amount to sixtie three yeeres, not one
of a hundred doth arriue to that age. As you walke in
the streetes, obserue the number of passengers, iudge of

their yeeres by their complections; or looke into the
Register booke of your Churches, and you shall finde
more liuing vnder the age of thirtie, then aboue. Now
from this age to sixtie three, there remaines thirtie
three yeeres; a long time, I confesse, in respect of mans
age: for the wisedome of the law, the common course
and practise of these times, doth proportion one and
twentie yeeres to three liues: before man comes to the
age of fifteene, most commonly he hath lost the greatest
number of his kinsmen and friends. And hence it
is, that euery man desires to free his lands from wardship,
though otherwise they are the eldest sonnes of
such men, who are vsually matched very young, and do
no way indanger their liues. If man comes vnto fortie
yeeres, then all his acquaintance is among the dead:
he scornes to conuerse with young men, to take their
counsell or aduice, whom he knew boyes without vnderstanding,
and are still boyes, in respect of himselfe.
Whereas all other creatures doe attaine to their full
perfection of growth, and strength, long before they
attaine vnto the third part of their age; and for all other
their workes of nature, their breeding, the soundnes
of their bodies, the continuance of their liues, you
shall finde a farre greater certaintie in them, then in the
condition of man.
            For the length of mans age, as some other creatures
exceed man, so man exceeds the most of the creatures;
for after the fall and corruption of man, yet still the
mercie of God hath appeared in the preseruation of
mans life,The length of mans age. to assure vs of that immortalitie, which wee
should haue enioyed in our integritie; and to bee the
earnest of that eternitie, which hereafter wee shall receiue
in our flesh. It stood with the power of God,
and with the honour of our creation, that creatures
should decline by degrees, hereafter as they were more

or lesse distant from that first mould, made by the immediate
hands of God, and his owne workmanship.
And therefore the Patriarkes, with their ma
                  •
               y hundred
yeeres, farre exceeded their posteritie; but at the deluge,
it should seeme that God appointed a new computation
of yeeres for mans age, that hee might be the
more terrified from attempting of sinne, by considering
the frailtie of his owne life; and that God might
neuer be inforced to punish mans sinne, with the like
heauie iudgement of waters, whereby hee might incurre
the breach of his promise.
            Considering all the infirmities of mans nature, and
the weakenesse which seemes to bee proper and incident
to his condition, the life of man is farre shorter,
then is the life of the creatures: for here in this world,
by the course of Gods prouidence, there ought to bee
a lineall succession; the father should liue, and take protection
of his sonne, vntill his sonne should bee able
to prouide for himselfe: and herein, if you shall compare
man with the beasts, you shal find him farre short,
and very much defectiue.
            Considering againe the difficultie of many trades,
of many professions, which are necessarily required
for the vpholding of mans life, the learning whereof
takes vp the greatest part of his age;The comparison of mans age with the creatures. for we haue not
our workes by a naturall instinct, like the creatures,
neither are we fit to serue, fit to learne, vntill wee come
to the age of sixteene yeeres, and then wee must stay
out our prentiship. Suppose I were to vndertake the
profession of a Scholler; almost twentie yeeres would
runne ouer, before I could learne the rudiments of
Grammar, and then not thirtie yeeres will suffice to
attaine to any perfection of Arts. We can make no
addition of our owne, wee can adde no new inuention,
vntill a longer time be expired: and therefore it

stood with the diuine goodnesse, that the father might
be able to instruct his owne sonne in Gods law; that
seeing the motion of the heauens (the reuolution
whereof cannot bee discerned within lesse then the
compasse of mans age) he might worship the power of
the Deitie: and hauing a long time of miserie, and
great varietie of accidents, his time might likewise bee
prolonged, and the occasions often renewed, for his
true repentance and sorrow; and yet in his whole
time, he should not be able to secure himself, the respite
of one houre.
            The age makes not for the happinesse of a creature:
for we must consider, not how long we haue liued, but
how well we haue liued: and therefore I will speake of
the delights of this life,The delights of the creatures are greater then mans. wherein the dumbe beasts
seeme farre to exceede man. For these are not to be
proportioned according to their number, but according
to the capacitie of their nature. They haue no apparell
(I confesse) they haue no houses, no furniture, for
they want none, here is their greatest comfort and happinesse.
Man only, that is the stranger and pilgrime, he
must pitch vp his tent, set vp a house, or habitation for
himselfe; the proper and natiue inhabitants, are sufficiently
prouided for by nature her selfe. It would be a
disparagement for vs to set vp our seeled houses, if our
weakenesse and tendernesse would permit vs to liue in
the open ayre, vnder the faire couering of the heauens,
bespangled with glorious starres; vpon the pauement
of the earth matted, or rather fringed with greene
blades. Whether would you iudge him that is already
satisfied with foode; or the hungrie and rauenous cormorant,
that still requires more and more foode, to be
the happier? Whether would yee preferre him, that
hath all the helpes of physicke, being sicke, or him that
in perfect health requires no physicke at all? and this

is the condition of dumbe beasts, in respect of man.
            For the pleasures and sports belonging to bruite
beasts, you see that Princes and Nobles take their
greatest pastime, in those royall games of Hawking,
and Hunting. I would gladly know,The pleasures of the beasts. whether the Faulcon
receiues more delight in the sport, or the Faulconer?
the one being an actor in the businesse, it being
more agreeable to the nature thereof; the other a bare
spectator in the game. Heere is no violence, no coaction,
but a free and a voluntarie flight, and commonly
without resistance, without danger or perill. When
the sport is ended, then is the Hawke carried vpon the
hand, as it were in triumph, an honour well befitting
the state of a Prince: neither will she entertaine into
her seruice men of the meanest condition and place;
but such as expect other mens attendance, and take vnto
themselues the highest titles of dignitie, do notwithstanding
make themselues seruants and slaues to their
Hawkes. As much may be said for the Hounds, who
sometimes (besides the benefit of their sports) share in
the best part of the Venison.
            I would not here willingly haue you suppose, that I
were a Proctor, entertained to speake in the behalfe of
dumbe beasts: neither doe I here purpose to acquit or
excuse them from their miseries;The dangers of both. but onely to lessen
theirs in proportion to ours; giue me therefore leaue
further to compare them together, in such heauie accidents
and dangers as happen to both. First from the
elements themselues, the ouerwhelming inundations
of water; the vnresistable violence of fire; the ayre
with anoysome and infectious breath bringing a pestilence;
the earth not yeelding her fruites, causing a
famine; the inward diseases which are common to
both; the outward wrongs and grieuances, which they
sustaine from each other; the seruices and slaueries

whereunto they are subiect: and lastly their slaughter.
            Suppose that man, together with a dumbe beast,
should fall into any danger of waters; all the beasts of
the field, of what condition soeuer, doe naturally swim
to saue themselues:Man is more subiect to the danger of waters then the beasts. onely man, who seemes to be better
disposed for it, then any other land creature, in regard
of his vpright &amp; straight figure (as it were) resembling
the forme of a vessel, a broad and spatious breastplate,
that so the greater quantitie of water supporting
it, might vphold it the better, extended armes and
legges, together with the palmes of his hands, and the
soles of his feete (as it were) in stead of oares; his bones
not so massie or weightie as theirs, the rest of his bodie
being like vnto theirs: yet only man is defectiue herein,
and must learne that by art, practise and experience,
which they haue by a naturall instinct; though otherwise
man, of all other creatures, is onely inforced to
commit himselfe to the danger of waters. But obserue
and you shall finde it in a farre greater wonder; as long
as heate continued in the body, which by all likelihood
should eleuate and lift it vp, to preserue the body
together with life; then behold, the waues and the
deepe striue against nature, the one swallowing, the other
ouerwhelming mans body: but when his dead
carkasse for a few daies hath rested in the waters, whether
it be to disgorge him, lest otherwise he might taint
the sweete sauour; or desiring to make some recompence
for his death, that he might haue a Christian buriall,
whom the sea thought vnworthie of life; at length
she returnes him, and sends him to the shore, when his
body is breathlesse and cold, much heauier then it was
wont; and therefore with the stockes and the stones
might well haue sunke to the bottome, and there ha
                  •
               e
continued in a tombe of waters, were it not, that the

liuing should receiue some instructions from the dead,
and be admonished by the feare and terror of death.
            Hauing diued into the waters, now giue me leaue to
approch, &amp; to drie my selfe by the fire; only man, of all
other creatures,Man only subiect to the danger of fire. findes vse of this element, for his foode,
and for his warmth: other creatures seeme to liue in a
temperate zoane, clothed sufficiently against the winters
cold blast, and shaded sufficiently against the scorching
heate of the summer. They haue their dennes and
their caues without any chimneyes or stoues; only man
stands in want of fire: and therefore if wee looke to receiue
the benefit, first let vs acknowledge the infirmity
to be proper and peculiar to vs; and especially to the
weakest of vs, to women, children, and old age: and as
we receiue the benefit, so must we stand to the danger;
sometimes the losse and consuming of all our substance
and goods; sometimes the burning of our owne flesh,
neither members nor liues are alwaies secured; sometimes
contraries together conspire against man, the
water serues to carrie the violence of heate, and scaldeth
our hands and our shinnes; sometimes the very
foode or sustenance of man being ouer rashly taken,
in stead of a delicious taste, burnes the tongue and the
palate. O happie other creatures, that are exempted, as
from the vse, so from the danger of fire!
            When I consider these accidencies of water and fire,
I must necessarily conclude, that both the deluge of water,
and the future d
                  •
               ssolution by fire; both of them are
first and principally directed for man, as the fruites of
his offence, so the effects of his punishment: though
secondarily they might intend the dumbe creatures, as
they serue for mans vse and ministrie,
            To come to the neerer elements, which are more familiar
vnto vs, and wherewith wee are better acquainted.
First for the contagious ayre, no creature is so subiect

to a generall infection and pestilence, as is man. In
this one Citie we haue buried three thousand a weeke,Plagues and infections incident to man.
and so for many weekes together much about that
number, when the plague hath continued within the
kingdome for many yeeres. This plague, it doth not
arise from the food or any distemper of our bodies, but
from the ayre; it is a poyson which workes vpon the
vitall spirits, and seeming to neglect other baser and
inferiour parts first sets vpon the heart, striking at the
roote of life, and suddenly in a moment it brings vs to
ruine. If the partie himselfe shall happily escape, yet
still the infection continueth, though the garment bee
worne out with vse, consumed with the moath, yet in
the bare threads the poyson will priuily lurke: the open
ayre cannot sufficiently pearce, the fire cannot
cleanse, mans prouidence cannot preuent; but it findes
out some lurking hole, some shelter or couering to
hide it selfe, vntill at length it bursts into vengeance,
to the wonder and astonishment of nature. Summer
and winter both serue alike to harbour such an vnkind
ghest; it will inhabit the bare walles rather then it
will be excluded; the dumbe creatures, the dogs and
the mice shall serue to scatter it; especially fruite shall
nourish it, for it was the forbidden fruite, which gaue it
the first entrance and occasion. Marueile not how mans
sinne, like an hereditarie disease, should bee together
propagated with his seede, when the breath of his nostrils
may thus worke vpon thousands at once, vpon the
strongest and ablest bodies, to their vtter dissolution
and ruine.
            But plagues are rare, and seldome befall vs, they sollow
either the opening of the earth; when a poysonous
and putrified breath, inclosed in the bowels of the
earth, doth finde out some vent, and infects the plants
and the fruites; or else they are caused by some strange

coniunction or opposition of starres. For I will not dispute
of Gods immediate and extraordinary actions,
these I will passe ouer with silence, and reuerence, trembling
at his iudgements: but sure I am that God is the
God of nature, and hee can vse naturall meanes, for the
punishment of mans sinne: thus plagues are sometimes
foreseene and foretold. But to come to those infections
which are vsuall and ordinary; how many places are
there, where Physitians forbid our habitation? the hundreds
of Essex, Rumney in Kent, the Fennes of Ely, the
Marshes of Lincolne, the Woulds in the North, the
Moores in the South, the Downes in the West. These
are all vnhabitable places, and cannot agree with mans
health, as if God had not giuen the whole earth for
mans vse. They are wealthie (I confesse) if they were
healthie; the soile is rich and fat, it agrees with the nature
of all other creatures, makes them plumbe and in
good liking (man only excepted).
            Let vs leaue those noysome and pestilent countries,
and come we to the pleasant and healthfull foyle. Take
this one Citie, which certainly is seated as well for
health,Noysome places in Cities. being a sandie drie ground, and as conuenient
for marchandise, in regard of this kingdome, as any Citie
is, or can be in the world: yet in regard of commers,
their close buildings, the societies of men, for want of
fresh ayre, sometimes for the noysome trades, sometimes
for the ditches and vaults; how many streetes, alleyes,
lanes, are made inhabitable? All the Wha
                  •
               ffes of
London, Stepney, and S. Ptooleys will testifie as much
in effect. Marueile not, that the Gentrie make choice
of the Suburbs, and begin to build in the fields, they
are wise in their owne generation; they desire the prouision
and conueniencie of the Citie, but the ayre and
the breath of the Countrey.
            Me thinkes I am like the Doue, which flew out of

               Noas Atke: for hauing been tossed with the waters hauing
scorched my wings with the fire,The famine of man in respect of the creatures. not able long to
subsist or to houer in the pestilent aire, I must search for
some resting place here vpon earth, our mother earth.
For wee are made of the earth, we are nourisht by the
earth, and wee shall be dissolued to the earth; and yet
notwithstanding, this earth, sometimes for want of other
fruites, will affoord vs the fruites of a famine, as
leannesse, feeblenesse, palenesse, wannesse, &amp;c. In the
famine of the creatures, wee share with them, but they
no way partake with vs; their sorrow makes for our
sorrow, for they are directed to our vse; but whatsoeuer
griefe or want is ours, is properly our owne, and no
way concernes them. If God punish the earth with a
great drought, as it causeth a barrennesse in nature; so
it argues the barrennesse of our nature, in respect of
good workes. And as the earth opens and gapes for
raine, so mans guts and bowels (like Horsleaches) shall
suck and not be satisfied, for want of due nourishment;
then the dumbe creatures want sustenance and foode,
which they testifie with their cries, and their groanes.
And the time shall succeede, when man shall finde a
want of the creatures; and notwithstanding his cryes,
and complaints, though hee could neuer be perswaded
to a religious fast, yet at length (maugre his appetite
and riotous disposition) hee shall be inforced to an abstinence.
            The creatures vndoubtedly, are not so subiect to famine,
as is man; some of them cause a dearth amongst
vs, when God giues the labours of our hands (the fruits
of the earth) to bee deuoured of the Grashopper and
Catterpiller, as much better deseruing them, then wee
wretched &amp; sinful men: to others (as it appeares in the
Ant) God hath giuen a greater forecast &amp; prouidence,
to make her prouision in due season out of our plentie,

then man hath or can haue, notwithstanding his reasonable
soule.The beasts not so subiect to a famine as man. Some creatures there are, which feed vpon
the bare elements, or other common foode, and haue
alwaies a like plentie. Beares being hungrie will eate
earth and stones, vntill conuenient time serue, to replenish
themselues with better foode: the Eastridge will
deuoure Iron, and therefore she lends her feathers to
the Campe for their beautie and ornament, as being the
excrement of their weapons. Sometimes the clawes of
beasts yeelds nourishment to the stomacke, vntill the
stomack againe returne it with great thankfulnes, thorough
the liuer, by the veynes, to the parts frō whence
it was borrowed: As in nature there seemes a kind of
circular conuersion, the fruites of the earth doe fatten
beasts, and the dung of beasts doth fructifie the earth:
and thus it befalles some of them, in case of necessitie.
            Creatures there are which sleepe all winter, and are
committed to the safe custodie and protection of nature,
returning with the Sunnes returne, and freed from
the sorrow,Their famine is ours. partake onely in the ioy of his presence. Others
following (as it should seeme) the course and direction
of the heauens, doe alter and change their climate,
and affoording vs their companie onely in the
plentifull times, they neuer share in our wants. Many of
thē in the hardest times, seeme to be in the best plight;
the white frost fattens the birds, and the Rabbets, while
poore man creepes to the fire, and complaines of the
weather. To conclude, if any one of them smart, and be
pined in their foode, it is man that shall taste of that
iudgement, who feeds on their flesh; their punishment
lights vpon vs, and ours no way concernes them: any
one of them will serue for our smart, the rot of sheepe,
the murraine of beasts, the tainting of fishes, and here
is our vnhappie condition.
            Leauing the elements, let vs come to our bodies consisting

of elements. Why should man be more subiect
to diseases,How man is subiect to diseases. then all other creatures? Not any part of
man without seuerall and special diseases; not any moment
of his age wherein sicknesses and infirmities doe
not watch and attend their opportunitie, arising from
the very constitution of his body; the small poxe &amp; the
measles creepe in his cradle; the wormes, the scabbes,
and the botches attend him to schoole; in his youth,
hot agues and plurisies, like burning seas with their ebbings
and flowings going and returning according to
their fits &amp; their seasons, to the wonder of nature, &amp; the
astonishment of the Physitian; in his elder yeeres, the
stone, the gowte, the strangullion; then ruptures, aches,
and coughes; at length the dead palsie, the apoplexie,
the lethargie giues him his deadly wound. Thus man
stands to be baited, while all the diseases, like so many
furies, some gnaw at his throte, others th
                  •
               ust at his liuer,
some dart at the kidneys, others aime at the heart;
all nature cannot supplie the like president. And therefore
giue me leaue (though I offend much against the
rules of art) to compare man to man himselfe, the generall
state of man, to the picture of that man which
stands in the forefront of an Almanack; the Lion strikes
at the heart, and the back, while Cancer nips the breast
and the stomacke, Sagittarius shootes at the thighes,
Capricorne buts at the knees: and here you haue the
liuely representation of man.
            Euery time and season hath his proper and peculiar
diseases. In the spring time, when nature seemes to
make restitution for the cold winter, that as wee were
formerly exiled from a garden, so now a garden should
be brought vnto vs,The diseases of the season. (which indeed is an excellent embleme
and figure of mans resurrection, and his restitution
to Paradise) then begins the cold winter in our
bodies, a time of stormes and of tempests, then begin

the lurking and hidden diseases first to appeare, together
with the fruites of the earth, as a principall fruite
of the earth, heere is worke and imployment for the
Physitian: then the Summer approcheth, which seemes
to draw all heate out of our bodies, and leaues them impotent
and weake; we are wearie and sweate with our
idlenes, and while the little Bee labours, and whole nature
is busied in making her prouision, then wee desire
immoderate sleepe, as if the worke did little concerne
vs.
            But when we awaken, and see nature in her full beautie
and prime, how she is crowned with garlands and
varietie of flowers, how she boasts of the fruitfulnesse
of her owne wombe,The whole yeere serues for our continuall fits. in producing so many such excellent
and delicious fruites: then foorthwith begins our
sorrow, for with the fall of the leafe, we begin to complaine
of old aches. See then, we cannot couer our nakednesse
with leaues, but here is the fruite of the first
fruite that euer we tasted. Autumne is the time of the
greatest mortalitie, and this proceeds especially by eating
of fruites, an vndoubted token and remembrance
of that first forbidden fruite. Thus is poore man alwaies
sicke with continuall fits, he begins with the spring, for
in the spring the world had his beginning; hee findes
some abatement in summer, for then hee is smothered
and choaked vp with heate; but in Autumne his fits
are renewed, vntill winter approch, which hath resemblance
not to old age (as some suppose, and this were
sufficient) for old age is a continuall sicknesse, and infirmitie;
but to death it selfe, consisting of barrennesse, making
no difference betweene the fruitfull vine, and the
vnprofitable sallow: all woods must then serue alike
for the fewell, as all the whole world shall at length
be consumed in a generall combustion.
            From the diseases, let vs come to the cure: and first

for the dumbe beasts. All the beasts of the field know
what is profitable for their food,The easie cure of dumbe beasts. their sight, their sent,
their owne knowledge sufficiently informes them; according
to the season and time, thereafter they proportion
their diet; as is most befitting their nature, you
shall finde their habitation and dwelling; if sicknesse
attach them, they seeke no further helpe, but only their
owne naturall instinct; they begin the cure with forbearance
and abstinence, that so nature might strengthen
her selfe; then they seeke some physicall hearbe,
they know where it growes, they know in what dosis
to take it, and the manner of application: here is short
worke, I confesse. But come wee to man, and I feare I
shall proue tedious in my discourse. Man alone (notwithstanding
the diseases whereunto hee is subiect)
doth infinitly exceed theirs, both for number and danger,
yet wants he all those helpes, which nature hath
supplied to all other creatures in a plentifull manner:
and therefore man must intend a long course of studie,
very harsh and very difficult to supplie his defects, ars
longa est &amp; vita breuis. When I consider those large volumes
of Galen,
               The difficultie in mans cure. 
               Hippocrates, Auicen, &amp;c. me thinks it
would aske a mans whole life to peruse them. It were
wel, if the Physitian might be priuiledged and dispensed
withall for his health, vntill he had finisht the course
of his studies; but commonly in the middest of them,
sicknesse preuents him; setting the nature of diseases
before his own eyes, they sease vpon his flesh, notwithstanding
his great learning, and the strong bulwarke of
his physicke. Is it possible that all these huge and large
volumes, farre exceeding mans body in largenesse and
weight, should not bee able sufficiently to describe it,
but that euery yeere should finde out some place &amp; part
of mans body for a new incroaching disease, vnknowne
to the Ancients, and wondred at by the professors?
            
               In prescribing their physicke, obserue how curious
they are, it appeares by their dosis, their waights, ounces,
dragmes, scruples, graines, as if they were able to
square out, and to proportion nature to a iust rule and
leuell, to poyse and to ballance her to the inch: consider
their innumerable Recipe's,Our physicke not so certaine as theirs. their compositions cō
               s
                  •
               sting
of vario
                  •
               s and infinite ingredients; whereas certaine
it is, that there are but foure first qualities, &amp; euery
one of them may be allaied by his contrary. Wherfore,
I pray', serues so great varietie? I had thought that it
had been to hide and couer the mysteries and secrets of
their art, to make it seeme wonderfull and incomprehensible;
or else to raise the price of their physicke, to
make their own wares sale-able. But shall I tell you the
reason? In truth I feare they doe but guesse at their
physicke: Philosophie, whose search is deeper in nature,
seemes ingeniously to confesse as much, when as in euery
creature she placeth certaine hidden and secret qualities,
which the reason of man cannot finde out, as likewise
not the degrees of those qualities: and therefore
euery Physitian is an empirick, his learning is gotten
by experience, and not by reason or discourse; though
otherwise Scripture can giue him this testimonie, that
the profession it selfe is very honourable, as being the
appoynted meanes vnder God, for recouering and retaining
our health.
            From the Physitian let vs come to the Apothecaries:
When I see their shops so well stored and furnisht with
their painted boxes and pots, in stead of commending
the owner, or taking delight and pleasure in the shop,
I begin to pitie poore miserable and wretched man,
that should be subiect to so many diseases, and should
want so many helps for his cure, I could wish yt his pots
were only for ornament, or naked and emptie, or that
they did but onely serue for his credit, for he is the happie

man that can liue without them. But here I can doe
no lesse,Our distastfull physicke. then take some notice of their physicke; most
commonly the medicines are more fearefull then the
disease it selfe, I call the sicke patient to witnesse, who
hath the triall and experience of both. As for example,
long fastings and abstinence; a whole pint of bitter potion,
pils that cannot be swallowed, noysome distastefull
and vnsauourie vomits, the cutting of veines, the
launcing of sores, the fearing vp of members, the pulling
out of teeth: here are strange cures, to teach a man
crueltie; the Surgeon shall neuer be of my Iurie.
            In fetching this physicke (these Indian drugs) thousands
doe yeerely endanger their liues, through the diuersitie
of the Climate, going to a new found world,
they goe indeed to another world:The Indian drugges doe not agree with our bodies. where (as I suppose)
that the physicall hearbe of euery countrey is most
proper and fit for the inhabitants of that countrey, according
to the course of Gods prouidence; and according
to the Physitians owne aphorisme, that a cure
gently performed according to naturall degrees, is alwaies
most commendable. Their hearbes doe not agree
with our constitution; yet such is our wantonnesse,
that sometimes with taking their physicke, wee
ouerthrow the state of our bodies; and in stead of naturall,
we make our selues artificiall stomackes, when
our English bodies must proue the store-houses of Indian
drugges. There is a great distance in the Climat,
and therefore we should not rashly vndertake such a
iourney, to ioyne together things so farre separated
in nature. Sometimes againe with taking too little
physicke, we doe but onely prouoke and stirre vp those
humours, which we cannot expell: sometimes the curing
of one disease, is an inducement to another; lest
there should be an emptinesse or vacuitie in nature,
there must be a succession of diseases in mans body.
            
               The diseases of our bodie come to vs in poste, or on
horsebacke, but they depart from vs on foote, very leisurely
and softly; and in our cures, nothing so easie as
to commit an error,The errors of physicke. and being once committed, nothing
so dangerous. If the bodie be scalded with the
heate of thy bloud in a feauer, and that thou desirest to
giue it some vent; take heede, for if thou doest it not, in
a iust measure, it will straight turne to a Dropsie. Is thy
stomacke ouerloaded with ill humours, and that thou
desirest a vomit? sometimes it will draw on a phrensie.
Doest thou desire to purge thy distempered bodie?
take heed of crampes and conuulsions.
            Notwithstanding all physicke, and all other meanes,
which God hath appointed for the recouerie of our
health, yet is it generally acknowledged, that there are
certaine incurable diseases.Some diseases are incurable. Here the Art discouers the
weakenesse of her strength, and yet doth seeme to boast
of the foresight of her skill: being able to effect nothing,
not able to rouse vp nature, she seemes to complaine
of nature, and by incurable diseases, concludes,
that the wound and corruption of nature, by ye strength
of nature, is incurable. For if there were such a state of
mans health, as could not bee annoyed with sicknesse,
this were some recompence; but now all things seeme
to sound corruption. We iudge of the state of our bodies
by the excrements, and when our bodies are at the
best, they must needs be defiled; since of the best nourishment,
they make the worst excrement, and thereby
doe giue a sufficient token of their owne corruption.
What a miserable comfort is it to the sicke patient, to
heare his Apothecarie, Surgeon, or Empirick very learnedly
to discourse in the commendation of health; to
tell of their former cures, of their soueraigne medicines?
And yet at length forsaking their patients, to wil
them to prepare themselues, for it lies not in the power

of Art alwaies to prescribe a remedie.
            From the inward diseases, let vs come to the outward
wrongs and iniuries, which we sustaine from each
other, and these seeme to proceede for want of good
order and gouernment.The good gouernment among the beasts. But for the absolute gouernment
among the dumbe creatures, hee that shall well
consider the common-wealth of the Bees, how strict
they are within the territories of their owne Hiues;
how iust they are in putting those statutes in execution,
concerning idle persons and vagabonds, and likewise
the employment of day labourers; what an excellent
order there appeares betweene them, how great
the obediēce is from the inferiour to the superiour! he
will easily confesse, that the greatest temporall happinesse
of man, which consists in a good gouernment,
whereby he is secured of his person and state, is much
more eminently discerned amongst beasts, then amongst
men. I will not onely insist in the Bee, who
seemes to teach vs a platforme and president of a perfect
Monarchie: it is long since agreed and concluded
in Philosophie, that such disorder, such difference and
disagreement, such hate and enmitie, as is between man
and man, cannot bee found in the rest of the creatures,
nisi inter dispares feras, vnlesse it be in beasts of a different
kinde; and in the deserts and wildernesse, where
rauenous creatures doe together inhabite. Such is the
prouidence and gouernment of nature, that they liue
as peaceably as wee doe, in our best walled fortresses
and townes: the Citie gates though shut, yet sometimes
threaten as dangerous home-bred conspiracies,
as they doe secure vs of outward forraine inuasions.
            Howsoeuer, I would not taxe any law or kingdome
in the world, with a conniuencie and toleration of
iniustice; yet certaine it is, that as in the naturall body
of man, the parts neerest the heart are aptest for inflammation,

and in the remote parts, nature seemes to exclude
and expell all excrements and filth: so is it in the
gouernment of kingdomes,The ill gouernment amongst men. it is not alwaies safest to
liue neerest the heart, nor is it secure to liue in the furthest
distance. For euery kingdome hath his skirts and
his borders, where the poore and pettie gouernours, liuing
out of the sight of the world, and making some
counterfeit shew of their owne greatnesse, doe so purloinc
and presse vpon the poore commons, that indeed
their life seemes to be a thraldome most intollerable:
which to a generous and braue minde, that truly values
the naturall right of his owne libertie, is a yoke vnsufferable.
For to liue vnder a Monarchie, is no thraldome
but libertie; for in this corrupted state, of the creature,
there must be a gouernment, and this gouernment inforceth
a subiection: when this subiection is onely to
one, it admits of the least inconuenience, and therefore
is to be admitted as in nature, so likewise in reason.
            But I may speake it to Gods glorie, and to our owne
comfort, there is no nation vnder the Sunne, wherein
iustice hath a more free and current passage then heere
amongst vs.The good gouernment of this nation. Our Commons haue their voyces and suffrages
in making their owne lawes; matters of fact do
passe by the verdict of a Iurie; we are not acquainted
with the taxes and pillages which are vsed in other nations,
and indeed we are wholly vnacquainted with our
owne happinesse, bonum carendo magis quàm fruendo
agnoscimus. If wee did but see the daily practice of the
Princes in Italy, and elsewhere, wee could not possibly
be vnthankfull, to the present gouernment in which we
liue, vnder the safe protection of our most gratious Soueraigne
King Iames, whose raigne God long continue
ouer vs, &amp;c.
            Now at length to speake of the seruices and slaueries
both of man and of beast, if the dumbe creatures

seeme to performe any dutie or seruice to man, as man
himselfe is not freed from the like or the same seruice,The seruices of man and beast.
so is he tyed vnto them in a very large measure, to recompence
their labours abundantly. As for example,
is the horse appointed for the seruice of warre, for labour
and carriage? there are likewise footmen and
pikemen, as well as horsemen in Campes, and both of
them aduenture alike, the horse and the rider both of
them share in the danger. Now for his hire or rewarde
in the field, hee shall haue his trappings and furniture
very rich and costly, as the goodnesse of his mettall
and courage requires: when hee returnes, his lodging
or stable roome was first built by mans labour, his food
was prepared by the haruest man, hee must haue continuall
seruice and attendance by man; the Black Smith
must waite on his heeles; and so for the rest; there is
a plough man and carter, as well as there is a plough or
a teame; and he that lookes to receiue any profit by the
creature, must first performe his dutie and seruice to
that creature. And therefore no marueile, if he takes as
his owne fee belonging to his place, their cast-away
garments, as skinnes, wooll, feathers, and silke from the
poore worme, which he fits and prepares for himselfe,
not without great labour and industrie, which hee
weares rather as a liuerie to betoken the base condition
of a seruant, then as a badge or a token of his regall
soueraigntie.
            Not only our seruice, our care and charge ouer them,
but generally the slauerie of man, seemes to bee much
greater then theirs. First that it is in the same kind: for
if wee were to attend Angels,The seruices of man in generall. or some higher powers,
assuredly our condition would be more tollerable; but
here homo homini lupus, one man proues a slaue to an
other, and must submit himselfe to the will of a tyrant.
It is not vnknowne to all trauellers, that in other countries

there are captiues and slaues, sold in their markets,
they beare a certaine price and rate, and commonly
are valued vnder the price of a horse: see what account
and estimation man doth here make of himselfe; and
surely hee iustly deserues this punishment to fall vpon
his whole kinde, when as the Son of God was bought
and sold for a price, who was indeede the price of our
redemption. To leaue the barbarous nations, and to
draw neerer home, it is not long since the tenure of
villenage was here abolisht amongst vs (thankes to the
Clergie, for it was by their intercession); and at this day
wee haue prentises for yeeres, seruants in couenant,
which are in the nature of slaues, poore tenants must
drudge for their Landlords. And whereas it is commanded
in the law of Moses, that thou shalt not
muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the
corne, the intent of the law was, that wee should bee
mercifull to the dumbe beast, that he should take some
profit by his owne labours: but I feare wee are more
mercilesse to men. The old shepheard lame and feeble,
who watcheth all night with his flocke, and indures all
the stormes and the tempests, yet I feare he neuer tastes
any part of his fat weathers: the poore old countrie
housewife neuer sees the spending of her own crambd
Capons: and thus how vnequally and vnfitly hath nature
disposed of vs? some liue in their wantonnesse
and superfluitie, others in their wants and their miserie,
and in both you may discerne the corruption.
            Suppose the creatures were in subiection to man,
and did require no mutuall seruice from man, then
might it be said vnto man, Adeóne es ferox, quia habes
imperium in belluas: Is this the greatest point of your
glorie,The wrongs which man sustaines from the creatures. that you are a shepheard, a swineheard, or an
heardsman? But I pray' what subiection might this be,
when all of them seeme to conspire against man? All

against one, here is no proportiō of iustice. Who was euer
able to preuēt all dangers frō the creatures? Do not
the fowles of the ayre take the first fruites of his crop?
Doe not the vermine purloyne his substance at home?
the moth abates the pride of his garments, the flye
must taste of his best dish. Doe not those house-creatures,
the Bee, the Waspe, and the Spider, threaten his
person? and if hee comes foorth, then the Beare, the
Woolfe, and the Lion, stand readie prest to set vpon
him with open violence. We cannot vse any creature
with sufficient safetie and securitie of our liues: the
Horse, though hee wants hornes, yet hee hath hoofes;
though by him wee finde some ease in our trauell, yet
we must take heede of his tripping. Me thinkes I see
a number of tennants conspiring and laying their purses
together, readie to be deposed against the iust priuiledges
and customs of their Lord, or the ancient rights
of the Church (if you please) for the case is alike, it is
general and concernes them all; they are to intend their
owne publike and common good, before the particular
benefit of their Parson or Lord: and this is the condition
of all the bruit beasts in respect of man.
            But lies it not in the power of the Starre chamber, to
preuent all such conspiracies and combinations of the
creatures?The creatures may iustly conspire against man. Cannot the heauens keepe all things in a
more vniforme and strict order and gouernment? No
certainly, for it stands with the course of iustice, that
since man hath forsaken his owne ranke, cast off his
maiestie, and feeding on the carcasses of creatures, cloathed
with their skinnes, and their garments, doth together
put on their qualities and beastly conditions, in
so much that now in the time of darknesse, he walkes
disguised in a strange habit; no marueile if hee bee set
vpon and taken by the watch, euery one suspecting
him for some fugitiue: and as in particular he abuseth

them and himselfe in an immoderate vse of the creatures;
so in generall, all of them conspire against him,
and worke their owne malice.
            If any thing seemes to detract from the happinesse
of beasts, in respect of man, it is because they are continually
subiect to slaughter. But are men exempted from
this perill?Man is subiect to slaughter as well as the beasts. are there not as many snares to intrap vs,
through the malicious practice of our enemies, either
by the high way side, or in the secret and close night,
sometimes with an Italian figge, sometimes by a false
information in a legall proceeding, when our substance
drawes on our confusion, if all this faile? Yet I pray resolue
me: were it not better in the course of our liues,
to be fed and pampered with the beast, yt others should
take care and charge over vs, and at length (before the
miseries of old age ouertake vs) to end our liues with
a thrust or a blow, when in an instant we are bereaued
of sense, of life, and of motion, then to stay and expect
natures best time and leisure, when with long lingring
and tedious diseases, we should be first wrackt and tormented
with most exquisite torments, (for assuredly
the torments of tyrants, are not so cruell, as are the torments
of nature, being indeede in the more sensitiue
parts) and yet after these torments, at length wee shall
not faile to receiue the sentence of execution?
            In regard of my profession, I would not willingly intermeddle
in causes of bloud, rather let all penitent sinners
and offenders against law, freely escape by the benefit
of their Clergie; for wee preach mercie, and nothing
but mercie, and all the mercie of the law ought
to be ascribed vnto the Clergie. Yet here I can doe no
lesse then relate a truth: I doe therefore call you Sergeants,
Bailiffes,Tortures prepared for man. Constables, and Iaylers to witnesse,
how many prisons are there in this one Citie? what varietie
of chaines, of fetters, of bolts? what dungeons

and places of torments? what wrackes and strapadoes?
what stockes, pillories, and houses of correction? how
many kinds of death? hanging, pressing, burning, quartering.Weapons and instruments of warre.
Wherefore serues your office, or the office of
Sheriffes, but onely for the execution of these lawes?
Wherefore carries the Magistrate, either sword or faggots
before him? it is not to keepe away flyes or gnats,
but that he is the instrument of God vnto vengeance:
for whō are all these prepared? but only for man: by
whom are all these prepared? but onely by man, besides
the hanging and watchfull rod of Gods anger, and the
seething pot of Gods wrath.
            You Captaines and Souldiers; wherefore serues
your plentie of Artillerie? such roaring Canons, battering
Peeces, Muskets, Petronels, Caliuers, and Pistols;
these are not pot-guns for children, or haile-shot to
kill a wren, or a sparrow, or birding-peeces for young
men; wherefore serue so many Black-bils, Polaxes,
Pikes, Lances, such Swords, Daggers, Rapiers, Poinadoes,
such variety of weapons, (and the ancient glory
of England) the Bowes, and the Arrowes; for I will
not speake of vndermining the earth, the opening of
sluces, when the earth and the water seeme to deuoure
whole armies at once. I will not speake of other stratagems
and snares in warre, or the great Massacres in
peace; I pray' can all the shambles affoord so many
kniues, beetles, axes, as there are tooles and instruments
prepared for man. Iulius Caesar alone, who certainly
cannot be branded with any note of the greatest crueltie,
yet in his battailes, he is said, to vanquish and kill an
eleuen hundred thousand fighting men, besides his
owne souldiers, who were slaine in the conquest.
            From the death of man and beast, which seemes to
be incident and common both to man and to beast,
giue me leaue to speake one word of their funerals.

When I remember how the young chickins,The funerals of both. though
continually fed in the chanell, without respect, should
now at length be serued vp in a siluer dish, vpon a Damaske
tablecloth, with much pompe and solemnitie, to
be foode for their masters; neatly handled, curiously
carued, and safely laid vp in their bowels; certainly I
commend their funerals before mans, who is wrapt in
a sheete, buried in a pit, where his carcasse corrupts, and
is made meate for the wormes. Thus behold the glorie
of the world, the mirrour of nature, man for whom the
whole fabricke was created, to whose vse and seruice
all creatures were directed, who is a little world epitomized,
an abridgement of nature; man (I say) so farre
exceeding all other creatures in that high prerogatiue
of a reasonable and immortall soule, yet in regard of
the corruption of his flesh, his condition is equall, if
not inferiour to the beasts of the field. It should much
detract from the wisedome of nature, and almost imply
a contradiction in the workes of nature, if it were not a
punishment iustly inflicted on man for his sinne, that
man so farre exceeding all other creatures, should notwithstanding
in his end bee accounted and numbred
with the basest: for so saith the Wise man, I haue said to
the graue, thou art my mother, and to the worme thou
art my brother, my sister, my kinsman.
            
            To conclude, strange it is, that in the dumbe creatures,
there should be no miserie proper and peculiar to
them, wherein we doe not share with them alike, and
partake in their misfortunes: but many ill accidents do
daily befall vs, not onely in regard of our reasonable
soule,Mans miseries are either of body or mind. which is proper to our selues, but likewise for our
bodies, consisting of the same elements with theirs, and
yet therein they haue neither part nor portion with vs,
and in those miseries which both sustaine alike, mans
are much greater in the same kind. And hitherto I haue

only spoken of such things, which concerne man properly
in respect of his bodie, and in comparison with other
creatures: now I will single him seuerally by himself,
and in regard of the difference of his parts the soule
and the flesh, I cannot fitter resemble him, then to the
Vniuersitie and towne of Cambridge; for in one and
the same person, as likewise in one and the same circuite
of place, you shall finde two seuerall Corporations,
two distinct Charters, different statutes, &amp; lawes,
each opposing other, each accusing other, when both
may want reformation.
            Now let me come to the more noble part, to speake
of the diseases of the minde: Is it not a sufficient miserie,The miseries of the minde.
to be thus molested aboue measure, by the weaknes
and infirmities of the flesh, not any one creature being
subiect to the like afflictions, but that there should bee
sorrowes and grieuances which are proper and peculiar
to the minde, first begun in the minde, and therefore
only competent to man, and from the minde at length
bursting foorth in the bodie, either by melancholy fits,
forbearance of meate, neglect of his naturall rest, as
poysons inwardly takē break out into sores. And these
are much more dangerous then the diseases of the flesh;
insomuch that sometimes man turnes desperate, and
commits the most cruell, bloudie, and vnnatural action,
that possibly heart can imagine; his owne hands shed
his owne blood, all his parts conspire against nature, he
is the offender, and the partie offended, the Iudge, the
witnesse, the Iurie, the executioner, and the sole beholder,
to arraigne and condemne himselfe,Selfe-homicide the most vnnaturall sinne. and in an instant
bereaued both of life and of sense, he makes himselfe
wholly vncapable of repentance: Contrarie to all
forme of iustice, and most contrarie to all right of nature,
which abhorring and detesting blood, as in all others,
so most especially in it selfe, as hauing this principle

rooted and grounded in the heart, that charitie
should begin with it selfe: and as man doth not giue
himselfe life, nor cannot continue his life, so is hee not
Lord of his life, or his death, but must patiently expect a
time for his dissolution, as there was a iust time appointed
for his birth and natiuitie.
            The only comfort in all bodily afflictions, is the comfort
of the soule to the members, the patient forbearance
and hope of amendment: but if the soule her selfe
be once distressed or distracted,The flesh increaseth the miseries of the minde. it lies not in the power
of the dull and heauie flesh, to asswage her, but she will
rather increase her paine, vpbraid her, moue her to impatience,
as the righteous Iob was strongly tempted by
his wife to curse and forsake God.
            Speaking of the diseases of the minde, I cannot forget,
that I haue alreadie proued the eternitie and immortalitie
of the soule, and therfore am tied (as it were)
by promise to iustifie my former assertions, to excuse
the same soule from all sicknesses inclining to death.
See here the wonderfull prouidence of God,The diseases of the minde may consist together with the immortalitie of the soule. the naturall
man by force of his owne reason, acknowledgeth
the immortalitie of the soule, as touching the life and
continuance; and by the same reason, hee likewise acknowledgeth
the sicknesses and diseases of the soule,
morbi animi, languores animi, nothing is so commō and
triuiall among the heathen Philosopher; as if I should
say in effect, that nature discernes a second death, a
death of sinne, though not a second birth, a generation
to righteousnesse; to the one, nature is inclined, and very
fitly disposed, and therefore sets it before her owne
eyes; in the other, nature is defectiue, and no way prepares
man, and therefore as blindfold, she cannot behold
it; our inward corruption leades vs to sinne, only
sanctifying grace recalles vs from sinne: man here rests
vpon the face of the earth, heauen is aboue, hell is beneath;

set vp a ladder, and he shall hardly climbe; giue
him wings, it will not auaile him; d
                  ••
                but open a pit,
and he shall fall with great ease, though hee finde little
ease in his fall.
            In discouering the diseases of the minde, I will tell
you a greater miserie: Suppose that any one man should
turne franticke in a hot burning feauer, and should perswade
himselfe,The diseases of the minde are not easily discouered. that his violent and vnnaturall heate,
did only proceed from his own strength of nature; then
he begins to buffet his keepers, and will not lie still in
his bed; here is a double cause of griefe, not so much
for his sicknes, as for his error and impatiencie. Thus it
befals many, that are sicke in their minde, who glorie
and boast in their vices, making their own shame, their
commendation, either supposing 
                  ••
               others to bee like
vnto them, and sanctitie to consist only in the outward
appearance; or else condemning all others, they will
maintaine their own practice, Populus me sibilet, at mihi
plaudo: I care not what the poore people say of me,
(quoth the Vsurer) my substance shall vphold me, when
they goe a begging. The adulterous man pleaseth himselfe
with vncleannesse, and begins to doubt, whether
a naturall act can be a sinne against nature. The glutton
will make strong arguments in defence of his riot:
Wherefore should nature supplie such plentifull prouision,
if he might not take it in abundance. If he cannot
wholly excuse himselfe, yet he will lessen his sinne, nihil
non mentitur iniquitas sibi. Whereas vertue is placed
betweene the extreames, vices doe now cluster together
in such multitudes and throngs, that vertue is either
prest to death, or wholly excluded; vertue no longer
appearing, vices sit in the throne, and vsurpe the
chaire of estate.
            On the contrarie, vertue is sometimes reputed for
vice, and so loseth a great part of her happinesse, which

consists in due esteeme and reputation, besides her attractiue
power, to draw all others to the imitation of
her selfe.Vertue is somtimes reputed for vice. The most reuerend Fathers of the Church
haue been 
                  •
               axed with ambition, by the rude and base
multitude; the most strict, mortified and seuere men,
haue been charged with a deepe hypocrisie and dissimulation;
the most magnificent and bountifull, with
popularitie and wastfulnes; the most vpright and sincere
in iustice, with vaine glorie and pride. Herein as I
doe excuse the innocencie of one, so I doe condemne
the corruption of many, they looking thorough painted
glasses, their own hearts being defiled, cannot rightly
iudge of the colours.
            Hitherto we seeme to doubt of the diseases: now at
length if we conclude in generall that vertue is vertue,
that sinne is sinne, and vice is vice; then here is a second
miserie,No man will confesse himselfe vicious. that whereas all bodily diseases doe suddenly
discouer themselues by their symptomes, and signes,
and inforce the sick patient to confesse his owne griefe;
onely the diseases of the minde (as are the inward
thoughts of the heart) they are secret, they haue learned
the language of equiuocation, they walke disguised,
and will neuer acknowledge themselues to bee themselues:
for that euill spirit, which hath taken away
shame in the sinne, hath put a shame in the confession of
sinne. The proud man feares nothing so much, as left he
should abase himselfe with too much humilitie; charge
him with pride, and hee will make bitter inuectiues against
it; then he begins to apologize for himselfe, how
curteous and kinde he is in his entertainment, how affable;
thus still he deceiueth himselfe, for therein consisteth
his pride. And so for al others the diseases of the
mind, they are not open assaults, but priuie conspiracies,
and therefore are secret, such as will endure the wrack,
before they will discouer thēselues, or their own ends.

If the diseases once appeare and are made manifest,
sometimes there falles out a pitifull and a lamentable
accident. I haue seene many vertues resident in one
heart,Many vertues are spoyled with one vice. like many Iewels, all contained in one casket, and
yet all of them tainted, deiected and cleane cast downe
with one vice. An excellent wit, accompanied with honest
and faire conditions, attended on with comelinesse
and beautie of members; yet through a tractable nature,
is easily led away with ill companie, and all his
good parts are ouerwhelmed with a deluge of drunkennesse.
The braue courage and resolution, which
leaues nothing vnattempted that may tend to the seruice
and honour of his countrie; yet sometimes is inraged,
set on fire, and all his good qualities are burnt
and consumed with the furie of his own lust. The great
Clerke with his night-watchings and studies, pining
himselfe, not vnlike his owne taper, where the head wasteth
the whole body, in lightning others, he consumes
himselfe, who indeed doth best deserue both of Church
and of State; laying the foundations of truth and pietie
in the Church, and building vp the walles of ciuilitie
and obedience in the State; yet sometimes with a
fond affectation of singularitie, he makes himselfe ridiculous.
Not to speake of any single encounter of vertue
to vice, many vertues knit and combined together,
may be foyled, deiected, and cleane cast downe with
one vice: sometimes they are choked vp with gluttonie,
incombred with couetousnesse, grow rustie and dustie,
with sloth swolne and puft vp with pride, cancard
with enuie, stretched vpon the racke of ambition, insnared
with the hooke of blinde fancie, and selfe-conceited
opinion; if but a sparke of choller or furie fall
on the stubble, it will inflame all: and thus one flye
serues to infect a whole pot of sweete oyntment.
            For the seuerall diseases of the minde, compare them

to the sicknesses of the body: Pride seemes to be an inordinate
swelling, like a dropsie, which with wind, waters,
or ill humours, puffes vp the flesh; for good blood,
which serues for our strength, and our nourishment,
will containe it selfe within his owne bounds.The diseases of the minde are compared to the diseases of the body. Wrath
is like a plurisie, when the heart and the lites are all on a
fire, nothing can quench it, nothing can asswage it, but
the effusion of blood; then wee begin to be mercilesse
and cruell, and if the Sunne goe downe in our wrath,
then is our case desperate; the criticall houre is dangerous,
for if it will endure the light, it will neuer flie in
the darknesse. Lust is like a burning feuer, which with
shaking fits, puts man into diuers inordinate passions,
and giues him the shape of a beast; for beasts doe naturally
desire the propagation of their owne kinde, and
in their kinde the eternising of themselues: but man
should looke to the immortality of his soule, the resurrection
of his flesh; which together with Gods law, his
owne conscience, and the vncleannesse of sinne, should
serue to bridle his lust. Enuie is as a corrosiue, or as a
worme bred in the spleene, which consumeth it selfe, in
maligning others; it feedeth not on the best, but on
the worst things in nature, and so at length bursteth it
selfe with his own poyson. Sloth seemes as a lethargie,
which brings man to a dead sleepe; it buries him vp
quicke and aliue, it consists onely of earth, stands immoueable,
without any sparke of fire; here is the dulnesse
of the flesh, without the agilitie of the spirit; here
is a carcasse of man, without any vse of his limbes or
his members.
            Suppose there were some innocent men not tainted
with these vices; then must you conceiue that I do not
speake of the persons, but of the nature in generall: for
I will not dispute how powerfull in the heart of man,All men inclined to vice. is
the working of Gods spirit; but sure it is, that such vices

there are, some in some persons, and al in the whole
kinde; for otherwise we could not haue knowne them,
wee could not haue discouered them: the suspicious
minde of man could not haue raised such slanderous
and false accusations against himselfe, without some
ground-worke of truth. These are no exotick or forraine
drugges, but weedes growing in our owne gardens,
issuing from the corrupted roote of our nature:
sometimes in one man you shall obserue them in full
number and plentie, the mysterie of iniquitie shadowed
in the vaile of our flesh; and in the most sanctified
man, you shall discerne an inclination to sinne.
            If there were no other punishment of vice, but vice
it selfe, this were sufficient; for nature hath imprinted
in euery man a hate and detestation of sinne: but God
in his iustice,The punishment of vice. as he hath framed man of a soule and of a
bodie, and both of them doe mutually receiue together
their portion of ioy, or of sorrow; so by an especiall
ordinance God hath decreed, that the vices of the one,
should burst foorth to the miseries of the other. The
young drunkard shall in time lament, the dropsie and
palsie to preuent his age; surfeits shall follow riots, the
gowte shall ouertake idlenesse: the lustfull gallant shall
in time perceiue, that a French disease hath disfigured
his beautie, and weakened his bones. Euery disease of
the minde hath a proportionable disease of the bodie:
if thou regardest not the staines in the soule, yet thou
shalt finde the smart in thy flesh, and therefore in both
acknowledge the corruption of thy nature.
            Notwithstanding the punishment of sinne, and the
vncleannesse of sinne, yet I will spare my selfe this labour,
to speake of mans seuerall vices. For howsoeuer
they are generally acknowledged, as the diseases of the
minde, seeing that mans owne reason, and his naturall
instinct, will therein testifie against himselfe, and therefore

they should be the greatest torments to nature:All wil not acknowledge the miseri
                     •
                   of sin. for
corrupted nature cannot sleep securely, but for her own
punishment discernes her owne corruption. Yet some
there are, who delight in vncleannesse, like swine, wallowing
in the mire; and here is a miserie of all miseries
the greatest, that I should now at length be inforced, to
make a difference betweene the disease and the miserie.
I will therefore passe ouer all the diseases of ye mind,
the whole number and rable of vices, which are the
strongest, the most forcible and pregnant arguments to
proue our inbred corruption. For as it is in trees and in
plants, so likewise in man, if any one leafe doe miscarry,
assuredly the roote is vnsound; the least vice argues
nature corrupted, but I will generally tye my selfe to
those qualities which are common to all, wherein there
is no appearance of delight, and therein shall appeare
our wretched condition.
            It hath pleased God for the continuall memorie of
mans first offence, still to permit in man, an inordinate
desire of knowledge, notwithstanding his naturall ignorance.The torture of ignorance in the vnderstanding.
The first thing which the states-man requires,
not without his great labour, his charge and his perill,
is to haue iust notice and true intelligence; the vulgar
people runne wandring after newes, they will not forbeare
to speake; though they forfeit their long eares,
they will abuse their licentious tongues: the young
Student will make tapers of his owne m
                  •
               rrow, and together
with his oyle spend his own flesh, and pine himselfe
with his night-labours, to prie into the secrecies
and mysteries of nature. Thus is the vnderstanding
perplexed and tormented with his owne error; and assuredly
to a generous and braue minde, the bondage of
Aegypt is not so intollerable, as is the captiuitie of ignorance.
Who can patiently endure, that the soule being
quick sighted and piercing, for want of perspectiue

glasses, should be imprisoned within the bounds of our
sense, mewed vp in a darke dungeon of blindnesse; here
is the torture of error: but if once we escape, if once we
approch to the light, then followes the curiositie of
knowledge, wee are dazled with too much light; and
being not able to behold the Sunne, still wee fasten our
eyes, till at length the spirits are dissolued, and wee fall
againe into darknesse.
            From the error in the vnderstanding, let vs come to
the will in the actions. Strange it is, that there should
be no cōformity in man,The torture of expectation in the will. the vnderstanding or thoughts
doe not alwaies accompanie the speech, or the gesture.
The will most commonly ouertakes the actions, and
then are we tortured with long lingring hope, and expectation;
we know not how to proceed by degrees, as
nature prescribes vs a rule in all her actions: but wee
must haue our leaps and our skippings, and cannot obserue
an equalitie in our proceedings. The young heire
will not endure to stay the respite and leisure of others,
for his inheritance, but he will sell his state in reuersion.
The Student no sooner looks on the title, but presently
turnes to the Index: wee seeme like posts in our iourney,
and expect a like speedie passage for our sight
and our flight. Thus in attaining perfection, the minde
is stretched out vpon the rack of expectatiō, and sometimes
the heate of our desire is abated, before things
come to the ripenesse. As if in the spring wee should
long for the fruites of the haruest, when in the summer
season, either wee forget our owne longing, or hauing
tasted the fruites, the sweetnesse seemes to bee alreadie
past, and spent in the expectation.
            Suppose that the vnderstanding either not possest
with error, or not hastening to be resolued, should not
torment it selfe with expectation; nor the will should
be disquieted by prolonging her hopes, but that the

one were enlightened with true wisdome,The preuision of euill. and the other
setled with constant and quiet affections; then
behold the foresight and knowledge of such euils, as
may daily befall vs, strikes vs with terrour and fearfulnesse.
Haue I escaped one danger? I confesse mine own
merits, I acknowledge thy mercy sweet Iesu; what
hath thy wisedome reserued in the second place to assault
me?
            Me thinkes, I see the state and condition of euery
man,That we stand in danger of many euils. liuely set forth in the first Chapter of Iob: Wheresoeuer,
or howsoeuer the wind blowes, from any quarter
of the world, it still serues to bring vs some heauie
tidings, concerning our selues, our health, our children,
our kindred, our substance, our seruants: all are subiect
to shipwracke, euery thing falles to decay; and must be
repaired, not with restitution, but with patience and
long suffering. See you not the Merchant, how carefull
he is, twice euery day to meete at the Burse? It is to enquire
what ill newes hath befallen him: poore wretched
man, that should be thus subiect to so many ill accidents!
The very thought and feare of many euils doe
perplexe the mind as much in effect, as doth the sustaining
of any one in particular: for neither of them doe
immediately touch the reasonable soule, and both of
them are alike apprehended in the vnderstanding; and
it is the vnderstanding, which is onely capable of ioy,
or of sorrow.
            Suppose a man to bee carelesse and dissolute of his
worldly estate;The fearfulnesse of death. or suppose his estate to be such, and so
great, that hee feares no casualties or dangers, Extra
fortunae iactum. If the Sunne and the Moone doe arise
(quoth the Vsurer) my daies of payment will come;
if the Common Law of England stand in force, I haue
him fast bound in a statute or recognizance. Heere is
good security I confesse: but thou foole, this night thy

soule shall be taken from thee; where are thy goods,
where is thy substance? Suppose thy honour or wealth
should encrease, yet thy life (which is the foundation
to support all the rest, whereby thou art made capable
of the rest of thy blessings) daily decreaseth; euery day
thou leesest a day of thine age; and in euery moment,
thou standest in feare of a sudden death: O mors, quàm
amara est memoria tua homini pacem habenti in
substantijs suis? O death, how bitter is thy memorie,
to him that reposeth trust in his owne wealth?
            If man were sufficiently prepared to die, and that he
did not respect the shortnesse of his owne daies, in
hope of a better world to succeed;The Good of others depending vpon our life. yet the very
thought and commiseration of others (whose standing
or falling, depends vpon his life or his death) would
greatly perplexe him. The poore husband sitting at
meate, accompanied with his louing and beautifull
wife, (who indeed is the ornament of his table, and like
a fruitfull vine vpon the walles of his house, together
with all his hopefull children, like Oliue branches
round about his table) in the middest of his mirth and
feasting, begins to consider, what if God should suddenly
take me away, as the least crumme heere is able
to choake me? what should become of my fatherlesse
children? who should take thought of my desolate
wife? Alas poore widow; alas poore orphants! I haue
heere brought you into a miserable world; and if I
should now forsake you, better it were that the same
earth should together intumbe vs. Men are deceitfull,
kindred are negligent, friends are forgetfull; I know
not to whose custodie and charge I might safely commit
you. My state is very vnsetled, my Testament not
made, for I know not how God may encrease my
charge, or daily alter my state; I know not whether a
posthumous child may succeed me: alas poore widow,

alas poore orphants! to God I commit my soule, to the
earth of his sanctuarie, I commit mine owne body; and
for the remainder of my flesh, part of my selfe, my
deare wife, together with the fruits of my loynes, my
sonnes and my daughters, as branches budding from a
decayed root, I leaue you to Gods safe custodie and
protection. Hee that brought vs together, coupled
vs in marriage, and shall then separate vs by my naturall
death, bee an husband to my desolate and
forsaken wife: he that gaue me my children, and then
shall take me from them, be a father to the fatherlesse.
Heere indeed is ioy to the Christian man, but a cold
comfort to the naturall man, whose heart is full of distrust
and infidelity.
            I know not how other men may stand affected to
death; but in truth this very thought doth more perplexe
me,The feare of hell and damnation. then death it selfe (which thought I should
reserue as my daily meditation, vpon my first approch
into my naked bed) poore wretched man that I am!
when at length, without strength, without reason or
sense, hauing no power of my selfe, no vse of my limbs
or my members, when I shall lie in the pangs and agonie
of death; when my friends and acquaintance shall
leaue me, my little substance forsake mee; when mine
owne flesh shall be spent and consumed, and nothing
shall remaine but skinne and the bones; when euery
part is tortured with griefe, the soft bed seemes hard to
my wearisome limbes; when mine eyes grow heauie,
my breath noysome, my heart faint; then behold I shall
enter a combate (an impotent souldier I confesse) and
yet not a single combate; but here shall stand the vglinesse
and multitude of my sinnes, together with an
exact remembrance, and the ripping vp of the whole
course of my life, there the palenesse of death, the vncertainty
of my future abode and habitation; then the

feare of Gods iudgements shall terrifie me; the thought
of hell fire and damnation shall 
                  •
               amaze mee, to see my
selfe thus forsaken and destitute. And notwithstanding
my naturall inclination and desire of life, yet to be hurried
and carried away with the streame of the time; no
respite or leisure shall be allowed me; my houre-glasse
is runne, and of all my liues labour and trauell I shall
receiue no portion, onely my sinne shall accompanie
me, and shall attend mee to Iudgement; what shall it
profit me to win the whole world, if I lose mine owne
soule? or who shall deliuer me from this body of sin?
Of whom should I expect comfort and succour, but of
thee (O Lord) thou that died'st for my sinnes, and rose
againe for my iustification? Iesu thou sonne of Mary,
Iesu thou sonne of Dauid, Iesu thou sonne of God;
thou Lambe of God that takest away the sinnes of the
world, haue mercy vpon me; for thou art my God, my
Sauiour, my Iudge in whom I doe trust; thou art my
Aduocate with the Father, not to pleade my right, but
in thy pleading to purchase my right; for thou art the
propitiation for my sinnes.
            If there were any ioy or contentment here in this life,
the dumbe creatures,The creatures looke onely to the present. who onely looke to the present,
should receiue a farre greater measure and portion
then man. Who hauing a presaging minde, and well
considering that sorrowes shall ouertake the greatest
mirth, extrema gaudij luctus occupat: setting before
his owne eyes the frailty, shortnesse, and vncertainty of
his life; and that in death his honour, his wealth, and
all his delights must forsake him, torments himselfe
with thought and expectation hereof, before the sentence
be past, or the blow strucken: like poore prisoners,
who are more then halfe dead, before the Iudges
approch. And hitherto hath appeared our torments
consisting onely in the foresight, the fearfulnesse and

preuention of euill: now in the present sustaining therof,
I shall not need to speake of the torture.
            It may seeme to make for natures perfection,Man reflects vpon his owne actions. that a
man knowes not how to forget; the more hee striues
to forget, the faster it stickes in the braine; the more he
desires to blot out, it makes the greater impression;
like the bird which is insnared with the lime-twigges,
the more it struggles, the surer it is held. And this truly
I doe ascribe to the infinite mercy of God: for seeing
man is by condition sinfull; therefore according to the
condition of his nature, hee should suruay and view
his owne actions, both for his repentance, and for his
amendment. And being not able to forget, hee might
much better conceiue, that there is no forgetfulnesse
with God; and therefore still hee stands accountable,
he is not discharged, nor cannot procure his quietus est,
out of Gods Exchequer; and therefore must alwaies
be ready to giue an account of his stewardship.
            From this tenacitie of memorie,The remembrance of euil. together with his
discoursiue reason, proceeds such a sorrow, that still he
thinkes hee is tortured; hee cannot endure to see the
place of his torment, hee hates the instruments, together
with their first occasion; and his memory serues
him much better for sorrow, then for any other subiect
of what nature soeuer. The scholler when he hath forgotten
all his lessons, together with his play-daies, and
sports at schoole, yet still hee remembers the least correction:
as the vessell longest retaines an ill sauour; so
you shall not easily release the mind of sorrow, though
the torture be past.
            It should seeme, that the soule being eternall in her
selfe,The application. desires to make all things eternall, or at least to
prolong their continuance; and being naturally more
enclined vnto sorrow then vnto ioy, according to her
iust merits and deserts, being therein conuinced by

the euident proofe of her owne conscience, shee laies
vp heere for her selfe, a treasure of sorrow, as willingly
vndertaking a state of mortification and penance, that
seeing and feeling the heauie rod of Gods anger, she
might safely and securely escape the seething pot of
his wrath.
            Thus our daily calamities seeme to haue the nature
of serpents,Calamities are like Serpents. whose poyson consists in the fore parts, and
in the hinder parts they spit out poyson before they
can creepe; and this appeares by our fearfulnesse
and expectation of euill: they carrie poyson in their
taile and leaue it behind them; and this appeares by
the strong apprehension of the sorrow past, which renewes
mans griefe, when the griefe is declining. In so
much that I haue knowne diuers suddenly to faint, and
to be much perplexed, calling to minde those dangers,
which they haue already safely and securely escaped,
and this is as proper and peculiar to man, as is his reasonable
soule.
            From the powers and faculties of mans minde,His passions tend to his sorrow. I will
come to his passions; doe not all these tend to his sorrow?
Loue is accompanied with ielousies, suspitions,
and hate; hope breeds enuie, feares and vexations; euery
delight leaues griefe and remorse behinde it. If a
tragedie were made of all the seuerall passions of man,
which indeed are like so many factions or furies in the
State; all banding and trouping, hauing both their fauorites
and their opposites; assuredly it would proue
the most cruell and bloodie tragedie that euer past betweene
tyrants, especially considering, that they are the
houshold seruants of man: and in a priuat family (much
more in one person) there should bee the most perfect
and best Monarchicall gouernment.
            Not to speake, how easily man is moued to these
passions, or how these passions stand in opposition to

each other: how they doe degenerate betweene themselues,
looke to the fruites and effects of each passion,How the passions doe degenerate.
and you shall easily discerne the torment. As for example,
immoderate loue alwaies begets the greatest
neglect and contempt; and being once prouoked, it
turnes to the deadliest hate. As out of the most wholesome
hearbs you may extract the worst poyson: so in
loue, if the spirits begin once to euaporate, and the fire
decline by degrees, there will follow such a coldnesse,
such a petrification, as that the immoderate loue will
turne to immoderate hate. And herein I doe acknowledge
the wonderfull workes of Gods prouidence; for
seeing that this totall and excessiue loue, with all our
heart, with all our mind, with all our soule, is only due
vnto God, fecisticor nostrum (domine) propter te, &amp; inquietum
est cor nostrum, donec veniat ad te: if therfore
man shall diuert the course, turne the streame of his
loue, and wholly surrender it vnto the creature; then
hath God ordained, that such loue being vniustly imparted,
should be iustly recompensed with hate.
            I shall not heere need to insist in the variety of passions;
take any one of thē seuerally by it selfe: Doth not
choller exceedingly disquiet man, shortens his dayes,How euery passion torments it selfe.
occasioneth many diseases, and sometimes prouokes
man to attempt such a rash and headie action, as that in
the whole course of his life following, he shall neuer
be able to make any due recompence or satisfaction?
Take the melancholie man, do not his owne thoughts,
dreames and fantasies exceedingly torment him? can
he containe his owne imaginations? but as if wee had
not sufficient outward cause of sorrow, he frames monsters
to himselfe, and these proue fearfull and horrid;
in so much, that his haire stands vpright, and a cold
sweat possesseth his limbes; when no outward danger
appeares, then he is frighted with his owne thoughts;

hee sees armies fighting together, and thinkes hee is
haunted with spirits, and then hee cries out for helpe;
we are willing &amp; ready to affoord it, but we know not
where to apply it, for ye disease consists in the phantasie.
Good counsell is the best helpe, but alas he is vncapable
of counsell! he complaines that his head is all made
of glasse, that hee feeles his heart now melting away
like waxe, that mice are now eating and consuming his
bowels. Not much vnlike the simple pure sectaries of
our age, who in the point of the Eucharist, beleeue
things to be, because they beleeue them: Crede quod
est, &amp; est; crede quod habes, &amp; habes: the body is there
truly and really present, because they apprehend it so
by faith. O the wonderfull power of their faith! O the
excellent curiosity of their wits, which hath almost
brought them to a fit of a phrensie!.
            And it is the more to bee lamented, that the best
wits should bee most subiect to these fits; and in the
most noble and deepest vnderstandings, you shall most
easily discerne some tokens and signes of melancholie.
But you will say, that these are therefore the lesse, because
they consist in the phansie: nay rather much greater,Melancholie fits.
for it is not the flesh, but the mind which is capable
of griefe and of sorrow; the mind conceiuing them
as true, shee is alike affected therewith, as if they were
true indeed. For all contentment consists in the minde,
and according to the apprehension, thereafter followes
the contentment: but the iudgement, together with
the dignitie of the reasonable soule, seemes to bee exceedingly
disparaged; as boasting of light, and yet
afraid of her shadow. So that if with much labour, and
good persuasion, you shall recall this wandering
man; it is to be feared, that for euer he will bee ashamed
of himselfe to thinke of his errour; and will hide himselfe
in sobriety, hauing laid himselfe open with his

madnesse and follie.
            Not in himselfe alone shall man finde the fruites of
these turbulent passions; but being a sociable creature,
you shal obserue how they daily burst forth in his actions
and conuersation among men.How passions are, in respect of others. If two cholericke
men should conuerse together, you might thinke that
fire and brimstone consuming all others, would likewise
at length deuoure themselues. Suppose that the
cholericke and melancholie should enter a league, you
might as well conceiue that the two extreame elements,
the fire and the earth, should moue together in
one sphere. The melancholie with the sanguine can
haue no more affinity betweene themselues, then dancing
with mourning, or feasting with fasting. If melancholy
bee coupled with melancholy, assuredly at
length there will follow a gangraena, they will putrifie
with sorrow and discontentment. From this variety
of temper and passions, you would wonder at the great
hate and enmity betweene men; sometimes betweene
Nations. The Spanish grauity and staiednesse, seemes to
neglect and contemne the French le
                  •
               ity and complements;
the fine and wittie Italian, cannot endure the
dulnesse &amp; homelinesse of the Dutch Nation: somtimes
naturall affection cannot asswage these passions. From
hence ariseth the disagreement and iarres between the
old father, &amp; the young Gallant his sonne; for there are
different inclinations, proper to mens different complections,
and ages.
            Youth strong in body,The seuerall dispositions of men. wanting true wisedome and
discretion to guide his owne strength; age ripe in
iudgement and true wisedome, but hauing neither power
nor ability to put her owne proiects in execution.
From hence obserue the different inclination of both;
the young man (not considering the blessing and plenty
of peace, or the necessarie prouision for warre, or the

danger and casualtie of battell), desires nothing more
then the noyse of the drumme, or the sound of the
trumpet; whereas the old counseller that intends nothing
but safety, and values other mens labours, according
to the weakenesse of his owne crasie body, will
accept of peace vpon any the basest conditions. Thus
hath God set a distance or difference, betweene the powers
of the body, and the faculties of the soule: whether
it were to denie all men an absolute perfection in
both, so to abate the pride of our nature; or else to tie al
men together in a mutuall bond of loue, by a necessitie
of each others helpe, that the blind might carrie the
lame, and the lame might direct the blind in his passage.
Well, howsoeuer, sure it doth argue, that there is
some antipathie and disproportion betweene the fl
                  •
               sh
and the spirit, which being coupled together in marriage,
and neither of them well able to subsist and liue of
himselfe, and both of them adding luster and beauty to
each other; assuredly this enmitie hath fallen, since the
first contract or solemnization of mariage.
            Man being a sociable creature, what is there in this
world, which he should esteeme more then his credit
and reputation among men. Pride was the first sinne of
man, and euery man is naturally enclined vnto pride, as
well knowing the dignitie of his condition, and his
height aboue other creatures;Man must sustaine reproches. and truly in right reason
a generous and noble minde, without spot of basenesse
is most commendable. For there are degrees of men,
and euery man in his owne place should bee most respectiue
of his same and report; then what a corrosiue
were it to a vertuous and noble minde, to sustaine
wrongs, iniuries, reproches, contumelies most vndeseruedly.
Notwithstanding many mens great deserts and
endeauours, yet shall they neuer attaine the loue and
good will of the people; for the multitude, bellua multorum

capitum, like one vnreasonable creature with
many heads, hath herein the condition of dogs, alwaies
to barke at those whom they know not; and where
one whelpe begins, all the rest will follow the crie: Seldome
shall you see any man deiected and cast downe,
whom they doe not instantly persecute and tread vnder
their feete, insulting vpon those who cannot resist;
and being like patient Asses, to those who scourge, abuse,
and delude them, and thus they are iustly recompensed
for their malice and follie.
            Man being a sociable creature, hee carries a greater
reference and relation to others: and therefore not in
our selues alone, not in our selues, are the causes of our
griefe;Mans sorrow and miserie for others. but as if we were stubble, very apt for combustion,
euery outward sparke serues to inflame vs. See, how
the poore mother laments for her gracelesse and dissolute
child! how the father bewailes the losse of his
daughter, which without his counsell or priuitie hath
matched her selfe (by the practice of his owne seruants)
to a knaue and an vnthrift! how the parents mourne
for the death of their eldest and most hopefull sonne!
how the vnkle is perplexed with thought of the poore
orphants committed to his trust! how the children
finde want of their parents, forsaken and desolate, left
to the wide world, and to Gods onely protection! the
comfortlesse widow teares her owne haire, when shee
thinkes of her deare husband! the whole kindred and
family groane to see the waste of woods, and the ruines
of that ancient house, from whence they are all
descended; but now fallen into decay by wardship, or
ill husbandrie; if any one of the stocke doe miscarrie,
the shame shall be impured to all. Not vnlike the state
of the Citizens, if one breakes, others must crack; there
must be a fellow-feeling of the blow: how happy are
they whose state is whole, entire and absolute within

themselues? and this is the condition of dumbe creatures,
in respect of man.
            Suppose any man were freed from these annoyances,
as indeed few there are, whom neither kindred, nor
friends, nor followers did any way grieue or molest;
yet in the streetes or high way side,The griefe of compassion. (we shall not need
to visite the Spittles, or Hospitals) how many lame, how
many blinde, some vpon crutches, some vpon pallets?
what broken bones, maimed limbes, seared armes,
mangled legges, vlcerous heads, scortched flesh; some
without chinnes, some without noses, some without
hands to receiue, or feete to follow, yet still begging
your almes: Will you not vouchsafe to behold them?
Behold they shall waite and attend vpon you, at your
owne door; eseither you must put on hardnesse, and despise
your owne flesh, or otherwise you must melt in
compassion.
            You may thinke that I am driuen to some great exigent,
that now at length I should speake of the outcast
of men; as if I were to visite some Hospitals, or to make
a diligent search or inquisition for all those miserable
creatures,A passage from the miseries of the creatures to the vanities. in whom the frailties and infirmities of our
flesh doe most eminently appeare. But in truth I haue
here onely spoken of them, as the present occasion did
offer it selfe; I met them in the streete, or by the high
way side, and therefore I will slightly passe by them, and
I will hasten to ouertake whole mankind; whom I will
intangle in one common depth of our miseries, I will
acquit none from the highest to the lowest. And because
hitherto I might seeme to haue sunke to the bottome,
I will therefore now recall my selfe, and leauing
such miserable states of men, I will runne ouer all those
actions, and qualities, wherein our pleasure may seeme
to consist; or wherein there may seeme to be any appearance
of happinesse, and therein shall appeare our miserie

and wretched condition.
            The qualities I will thus diuide: They are such as either
are in our selues: 1. as are the gifts of the bodie, the
beautie and comelinesse of parts: 2.Wherein ioy may seeme to consist. or the gifts of the
minde, as profound learning and true wisedome; or else
they are such as stand in relation to others, and outwardly
concerne vs, 3. either in our possessions, wherein
I will speake of our wealth and abundance, 4. or in
our esteeme and reputation among men, wherein I will
speake of our honour: 5. or in our actions, our pastimes
and sports, wherein I will speake of our pleasures.
            First for beautie, for it appeares first to the sight, and
carries the best glosse: the fairest beautie and complection,
though proudest of her selfe, yet she neuer enioyes
her selfe;A looking glasse for beautie. and if in a glasse onely by way of reflection,
yet she presently forgets her selfe: it serues as a
white garment aptest for soile, and in old age proues
the most wrinkled and withered. If a Feuer (but for a
few daies) possesse a faire Ladie, then you shall best
iudge of her complection; a pale countenance, hollow
eyes, leane ch
                  •••
               es, fur'd mouth, panting breath, slow
speech, weake and trembling ioynts; all which could
hardly allure or entice her fond wooer. When beautie
is at the best, yet if it bee not adorned and set foorth
with Iewels, with silkes, with colours, which rich and
costly attires; if it were naked and desolate, clad in
homely weedes, it would hardly moue thy affection;
and when thou beholdest it at the best, thou seest but
onely the outside, for beautie is but skinne-deepe: if
thou couldest discerne the vncleane maw, the noysome
bowels, the vnsauourie parts, thou wouldest finde it a
painted sepulcher. But suppose the face were besmeared
with bloud, thou couldest not endure the sight:
suppose it lay rotten in the graue, as one day it shall,
and then, goe young man, please thine owne fancie, reioyce

with the wife of thy youth, see how louing and
amiable she lookes. This was the Hermites practise to
abate the heate of his lust, and let it serue for thy example
and imitation.
            In truth I doe much pitie many, who seeme neither
to regard their owne ease, nor their warm'th, so that
they may adorne their owne beautie;Beauty is troublesome. which beautie
might aswell bee adorned with their ease, with their
warm'th, not indangering their health, not indamaging
their bodies, if it stood with the fashion and condition
of the times. How costly, how chargeable, how
troublesome is their beautie vnto them? dum comūtur
dum pectuntur, annus est: all their whole time must bee
spent in their dressing. You may assoone furnish an armie,
as supplie all their trickets and toyes; there are
more fashions extant, then there is varietie in nature;
the French attire, the Spanish band, the Dutch coller,
the Flemish bodies, you would wonder of what countrie
or nation they were, &amp;c. What an excellent sight it
is, to see the old mother Matron-like, full of wrinckles
and withered, leading the way, (as it 
                  〈◊〉
                to the graue)
but the young daughter following her, a faire damosell
of a fresh and a beautifull colour, and yet both of them
consisting of the same flesh; like one and the same tree,
rugged and harsh in the rinde or the barke, but faire
and delicious in the fruite, and both take sappe from
the same roote, and both together tend to corruption?
            From the beautie and comelinesse of members, let
vs come to the inward light and beames of the vnderstanding:
The world is a Sophister, and frames a fallacie,
à bene compositis ad mal
                     •
                   diuisa, making a strange
difference and separation betweene true wisedome
and learning: whereas indeed there is no difference at
all, but they are one and the same facultie; wisedome is

learning,Learning and wisdome can admit no difference between themselues. and learning is wisedome; and he that found
out this distinction between them, was indeed an enemie
to learning, and in himselfe the sonne of ignorance.
Learning (I confesse) of it selfe is eleu
                  •
               ted aboue
the vulgar capacitie, otherwise it should not require
mens studies and labours; but being tempered with
discretion, and experience, may well bee accommodated,
and applied to many good vses, euen in the meanest
capacitie. For certaine it is, that there is no true
learning, which is not grounded in nature; neither can
it receiue any iust rule and direction, but only from nature
(for Grammar is only a step or an entrance to learning):
he that shall doubt of the wisedome of nature,
must needs confesse himselfe an ignorant foole. I confesse,
that the great Clerke may be ignorant of the meanest
and basest things; or happilie of their price, their
vse or valuation: doth this any way disparage his wisdome,
his learning, his iudgment? As if a priuie Counseller
should therefore be reputed an vnwise man, because
he hath no skill in husbandrie and tillage; when
his leisure will not serue him to intend such drudgerie.
But for this time, rather then I would any way hinder
my intent, I will willingly grant it; let there be a difference,
and such a difference as Scripture reports; a wisdome
in their owne generation, a worldly wisdome, a
serpentine wisedome, differing from the wisedome of
schooles. Now for this wisedome, see how she is defectiue
in her owne kinde, and there wanting, wherein
she desires to be most perfit.
            Great wits breed melancholy thoughts, and serue
rather to stirre vp ielousies and feares, then to giue courage
and resolution: the multiplicitie of their proiects
hinders their actions, and sometimes the wit contents

               t selfe with a vaine speculation of his owne plots, together
with an idle discourse, what would be done, or

could bee done,The misery of great wits. or should bee done, when nothing is
done to the purpose. And this I conceiue to bee the
cause, why men of the deepest vnderstanding, haue not
alwaies the best successe in the State; not only because
they are supprest by an higher power, which hauing alreadie
attained to the top, desires by al possible meanes
to secure it selfe: but in their actions intending and desiring
to auoid all casualtie and chance (which is so necessarie
and incident to ou
                  •
                fraile condition, as that it
cannot be auoided) desiring to build vpō sure grounds,
they spend their whole time, in deliberation, and consultation,
and chuse rather to manage their owne priuate
estates, then to commit themselues to the stage of
this world, to the fortune and varietie of times. And
hence it is, that seldome or neuer they performe or attempt
any great and honourable worke; and the wits
themselues are so dangerous, as that they giue men occasion
rather to feare and to distrust their practises,
then to relie vpon their counsels and directions. In so
much that sometimes it is a speciall point of wisedome
to conceale it selfe; as he that acts the foole in a Comedie,
is commonly the wisest fellow in the companie:
for you shall obserue, that the meane capacitie giues
greater hearts ease, more contentment, liues more plentifully,
and increaseth his meanes much better, then the
deep vnderstanding; who either will attempt nothing,
or not taking the ordinary course, most vsually failes in
his purposes. Where there is a little want of braine,
there you shall find the truest ioy; for it is a great point
of happinesse not to vnderstand his owne griefe. To
daunce about May-poles, to skip ouer bon-fires, heere
was the old countrie sport; and here is the truest mirth,
for there is no true mirth, without some mixture of follie.
Serious &amp; waightie thoughts are a great hindrance
to mirth; and great wits as they are alwaies ingendring,

so stand they alwaies in feare and in ieopardie,
the battaile and combat of wits being no lesse bloodie,
then that of the sword: whereas honest plaine men
protect themselues with their owne harmelesse innocencie,
neither fearing, nor fearefull to others.
            Great learning seemes to transport a man to an element
aboue himselfe,The discontentment of Learning. and being of little vse in this lower
region, the great Clerke hath his owne learning
for his owne reward, and is permitted quietly to enioy
himselfe, together with all his swee

               e and heauenly meditations.
Honour or wealth would distract him, and
interrupt the course of his studies; the noyse of this
world would awaken him out of his extasis: thus sitting
aloft in a Doctors Chaire, and wanting the earths
foundation, at length he must fall, vnlesse he be miraculously
supported from aboue. The discontentment of
learning in these daies, proceeds not onely for want of
preferment, but euen the credit of learning in her owne
kinde, is now called in question. All other trades are
able to keep
                  •
                their owne wares in their due valuation;
only learning in these daies, is growne so common and
triuiall, such are the helps of 
                  〈◊〉
               , translations, abridgements
and Indexes, so many, so plentiful, that me thinks
a naturall and mother wit seemes to ou
                  •
               face learning,
and to call it pedantisme, making a farre greater show
and ostentation of learning, then learning can doe of
her selfe; as things counterfeit, make alwaies the best
outward appearance; like bold and presumptuous liers,
who seeme to be most confident in their reports.
These gentle Clerks cannot be content to kindle and
enlighten their owne lampes, but now they desire to
put out the light, and to raise vp their buildings with
the ruines of learning, perswading the world that it is
not of that necessitie and vse in the State: whereas all
our religion seemes to adorne and support learning,

and together with it, is infused into the hearts of men,
all our ciuility, all our customes, our manner and forme
of speech, all our lawes, and whatsoeuer else makes
man sociable: all was first borrowed from the well-spring
and fountaine of learning; though now by habit,
practise, and continuance of time, we may seeme to
enioy them. When learning was once exiled, nations
turned barbarous, without the seruice of God, or the
feare of the Magistrate.
            I dare excuse nothing from vanitie, and therefore I
must truly confesse, that learning seemes to bee defectiue
in her selfe. For as the whole world is circular, and
as whole nature consists in alteration and change, the
night succeeding the day, and the day the night: so
learning seemes to runne in a circle or maze,Learning is defectiue in her end, yet superfluous in her parts. not attaining
that height which it aimes at; where it ends, there
it begins, reading much, and forgetting much, and neuer
comes to a period. Learning hath likewise her superfluous
lops, which in time may well admit incision.
I do not like an ouer-great curiosity in the knowledge
of languages, or a fond affectation of stile; I doe not
commend too much nicitie in the rules of Logi

               ke, to
be ouer-strict in the tearmes of Art, to fight about shadowes,
to insist too much in the precepts, when as the
perfection consists in the vse. Poetrie and Criticks they
are young mens delights, and lothed in age: a ripe and
staied iudgement will not admit the trickes and subtilties
of Schooles. Whereas the best learning consists in
the discouerie of the truth, and truth delighteth in
plainnesse, and in a homely attire. Ars est dissimul
                     •
                  re
artem:
we must not alwaies be precise in obseruing the
rules of an Art; wee must not stand strictly vpon the
formes of our Syllogismes; as if the reasonable soule
were not capable of a reasonable discourse, but she
must spell out the sense, by knitting and vniting the

propositions according to mood and to figure. Here
are the excrements I confesse, not vnlike the wings or
skirts of a garment, or the warts or spots of the flesh,
which serue for lustre and ornament of the rest, and
not for any speciall vse and commoditie: whereas true
learning doth wonderfully enlighten the vnderstanding,
quickens the inuention, directs the iudgement,
makes a dissection of nature, opens the entrailes, and
seeing the wisedome of the Creator, contents the curiositie
of our mindes, prepares the way to religion,
guides and directs vs in our actions.
            Giue me leaue in one word to speake in defence of
the Schooles: This is an infirmitie, which is not onely
incident to Vniuersitie learning,An Apology for learning. but to all other professions
in generall; for the nicities and trickes of law,
are as foolish in their owne kinde, as are the subtilties
of Schooles, were it not that a Writ, directed to the
Sheriffe for the execution of their lawes, doth mitigate
their follie. When the penne and the sword doe meete
together, then who dare stand in defiance, but make a
separation between both, and then strength will proue
brutish, and wit ridiculous; not vnlike him that should
dart a goose quill, (as learning is figured out by the
pen) of it selfe it will neither pierce, nor make any long
flight; but if the Archer shall cunningly take the least
part of it, and glew it to his shaft, then it will proue a
very fearefull and dangerous instrument in warre; but
thankes to the iron, and not to the feather. Wee can
discourse of the heauens and the earth, when as yet we
know no
                  •
                how to alter the proprietie: they can transport
the inheritance, when as yet they know not the
substance, conceiue the happinesse of the one, in respect
of the other: and here you haue the difference.
            The benefit which all professions seeme to receiue
from schoole-learning is such▪ and so great, as that they

being not able with due thankfulnesse, to make any
kind of recompence,The vse and excellencie of Schoole-learning. they requite it with iniuries, reproches
and wrongs: or seeking to conceale what they
haue borrowed, that it might seeme to be their owne,
they say with the tenants in the Gospell, Heere is the
heire, come let vs slay him, and the inheritance shall be
ours. To let goe all other meaner professions, and to
insist in the wisedome of the law; it were a foule disparagement
to compare the learning of all ages, the
learning of the whole world, the knowledge of God
and nature, with any priuate or prouinciall lawes, but
I do heere generally insist in all the lawes of the world.
Assuredly all their wisedome is onely borrowed from
schoole-learning; they haue indeed proper and peculiar
to themselues, their particular customes, the formes
of their writs, the manner of their proceedings, the nature
of their Courts, the extent, and signification of
their words, all which are framed as well as possibly
the wisedome of man could inuent; but the ground
and reason of their law, is onely taken from schoole-learning.
Whereas our temporall lawes are squared
&amp; proportioned according to that eternall law (which
makes much for the dignity and certainty of our lawes)
I would gladly aske who should take notice of that 
                  •
               
               ternall
law? to whose profession doth the knowledge
thereof most properly belong, but to the Philosopher?
who by the inspection of nature, viewing the course of
Gods prouidence, considering the soules actions, and
thereby iudging of her inclination, is able to make a
large volume, and treatise of that subiect. If question
be made, what circumstances doe alter the action? here
presently wee enter the lists of Morall Philosophi

               ,
which is able to direct vs for our selues in the Ethicks,
for our houshold and families in the Economickes;
for the kingdome or Empire in the Politickes▪ Now in

regard that the Church and the State are together
combined, and therefore must necessarily symbolize; if
any doubt be made in regard of a Christian Commonwealth,
here the Casuist Diuines take place, and must
giue his direction accordingly. To conclude, our
schoole-learning doth as farre exceed all the lawes in
the world, in the excellencie of their wisedome and
knowledge, as the lawes of God and nature, are much
wiser then the lawes of men.
            From the person and inward gifts of man, let vs come
to his substance, which doth most moue the common
sort of men,Of wealth and abundance. as being most sensible, and therefore I cannot
but take notice of it. Wealth giues no manner of
contentment, but rather like the dropsie, prouokes the
appetite; for the mind still continueth empty, and
therefore still may desire, when the purse or the coffer
swallowes vp the treasure. If this wealth bee excessiue
in some, then is the pouerty of others as excessiue; for
the enriching of one, is the impouerishing of another:
there is no new creation of nothing, we doe but robbe
and purloine from each other, and so at length make
our selues a fit and a fat bootie. In the greatest abundance▪
yet naturall temperance prescribes a moderation,

and wherefore serues thy great wealth, vnlesse thou
wilt, with the superfluitie of thy wealth, as it were with
the haire of thy head, wipe the feet of thy Sauiour, comfort
the comfortlesse, and helpe the distressed members
of Christ? If thou hadst nothing, then if thou canst
learne to contemne and despise wealth, thy state is
much more glorious and happie, then if thou enioyedst
all the treasures the whole earth could affoord thee.
Pouerty in spirit, Goe and sell all that thou hast, and

Christ and his Apostles.
            The richest man vpon some occasion,All men want at some times. at one time or
other, shall stand in need of some necessarie commodity;
either the yeere will not serue for his plentie, or the
season will not affoord it, or the market cannot furnish
him; sometimes his prouision for his owne priuat

                by land; sometimes wee light vpon cottages,
where all things are wanting; and what is this but to
be poore in effect, and in very deed, when we lacke all
these necessaries which our nature requires? I haue
knowne a great man in this kingdome, who might
haue spent many thousand pounds by the yeere, and
yet the report goes (which I doe easily beleeue, for I
was not farre absent) that hee died for want of a peniworth
of Aquauitae, which at that time might haue bin
a great meanes vnder God, to haue preserued him from
such a sudden death.
            There is a generation of men, who notwithstanding

their owne abundance, yet denie vnto themselues necessarie
prouision for this life;The miserie of wealth. who doe not choake, but

               ue themselues with their plentie. It is not for temperance,
or Christian discipline, but they spare, that
they may spare, and in the possession of their wealth
they make themselues slaues, they place them aboue
themselues, and not beneath themselues; they are not
franke and free of them, but intangled in them; their
wealth possesseth them, and they doe not possesse their
wealth; for it is the property of a master to say to his
seruants, goe, and they goe, come, and they come; but
heere they themselues are the drudges, while their treasure
is safely laid vp in their clossets, and somtimes their
minds are as griple, and as much disquieted, as if they
did liue in the greatest penury &amp; wants. I haue known
a man, who had not so little as twenty thousand
pounds of his owne getting, besides otherwaies a very
large and plentifull estate, being no way indebted; yet

            Many men haue laboured much,What is wealth, or what it is to be rich. and trauelled far,
to get wealth; suppose I should accompanie them, I
should not thinke my labour or trauell ill spent, if I
might but on

or what competent estate were requisite, which might

                  •
               y bee called wealth. For heere in the countrey
with vs, if a mans stocke of a few beasts bee his owne,
and that he liues out of debt and paies his rent duly and
quarterly, we hold him a very rich and a sufficient man;
one that is able to doe the King and the countrey good
seruice; wee make him a Constable, a Sides-man, a
Head-borough, and at length a Church-warden: thus
wee raise him by degrees, wee prolong his ambitious

hopes, and at last wee heape all our honours vpon him.
Here is the great gouernour amongst vs, and we wonder
that all others doe not respect him accordingly: but
it should seeme, that since the dissolution of Abbeys, all
wealth is flowne to the townes: the husbandman 
                  〈◊〉
               
at a rackt rent, hee fights with distracted forces, and
knowes not how to raise the price of the market: only
the Trades-man hath his Corporation, hee can ioyne
his wits and his labours together, and professing the
one, he thriues by the other; and therefore they are not
vnfitly called Handi-crafts. Now in the next market
towne there are great rich men indeed: for I heare it r
                  •
               
               orpted,
(but I dare not speake it for a truth) that there
are certaine Tanners, Chandlers, and other trades-men,
some worth 50. pounds, some 60. pounds, some a 100.
pounds a peece: this is wonderfull, for we cannot possibly
conceiue, how men, by honest and direct meanes,
should attaine to such summes. Indeed the poore people
say, that one got his wealth by the blacke art, another
found a pot of money in a garden, which did somtimes
belong to a Priorie; and the third grew rich, by
burying many wiues, for heere are all the possible
meanes, which wee can imagine of enriching our
selues.
            But now we are in the rode, we haue but a few 
                  〈◊〉

all waters returne to the sea: there dwell our Landlords,

               e
him. If an Alderman bee worth but twelue thousand

pounds, we pitie him for a very poore man, and begin
to suspect and to feare his estate, lest this ouer-hastie
aspiring to honour, may breake his backe. If a Nobleman
haue great royalties, and may dispend ten thousand
pounds by the yeere, yet we hold him no bodie in
respect of the ancient rents of the Dutchie. The Dutchy
notwithstanding the augmentation, yet is farre inferiour
to the reuenewes of the Crowne: these Northern
kingdomes come short of the Southerne; the Southern
Princes are starke beggers, in respect of the Indian:
Whether shall I flie, in the pursuite of wealth? I am
now farre from home, and it is not safe for me to trauell
among Infidels. I will rather thus conclude in reason,
if there bee wealth in this world, it is either vpon
the face of the earth, or else in the bowels of the earth,
like treasure conceald and safely lockt vp in natures
coffers. I will therefore here stay my selfe, and fall flat
on the earth; and heere I will solemnely proclaime it,
that the whole earth is an indiuisible point, and carries
no sensible quantitie in respect of the heauens. Thus at
length I will returne home, not loaded with oare; but
being much pacified in minde, and fully resolued, that
all wealth consists onely in comparison. Now if it shall
please God, to supplie the necessities of my nature, as he
in his mercie already hath done, (God make me thankfull
vnto him) neither doe I despaire of his prouidence;
I will not compare my selfe with others, but deeme my
selfe sufficiently rich; and if I should striue to be rich
in comparison, I should neuer be able to attaine mine
owne ends.
            Lay vp these money bagges; from wealth I wil come
vnto honour, as others by wealth come vnto honour:
The glittering and gingling of gold seems to resemble
honour; which is a pretie noise, a sound, a kind of fame
or report: if it want meanes to support it, it is like saleable

stuffe,Honor hath a weake foundation. which at first seemes beautifull to the eye,
but hath no substance to continue: if any one be raised
without merit, hee shall bee sure to fall againe without
desert. As are the mindes of men (of a mutable and
changeable condition) so is the foundation of honour
weake and changeable; especially in the multitude,
who alwaies iudge according to shewes and appearance:
and as they are soone gained with a cap, so are
they as easily lost with a frowne; their loues follow not
the honest 
                  ••
               tent, but the happie successe of the action.
Times and fit occasions giue the first beginning to honour,
and as it hath a sudden rising, so it proceeds not
by degrees, but commonly men doe outliue their good
fortunes, and seldome or neuer doe extraordinarie honours
mourne at their funerals.
            Especially in a subiect, liuing vnder a Monarchy, gratious
with his Prince, beloued of the people: this double
reference to the Prince, to the people, makes his
state dangerous and almost desperate; the one fearing
and suspecting him, the other laying to his charge all
the distastfull actions of State: for this man long to
continue, to hold fast with both hands, taking his honour
from aboue, his loue &amp; reputation from beneath,
and thus to hang in the aire betweene heauen &amp; earth,
is a worke very difficult, almost impossible. When honour
is at the best,The vaine ceremonies of Honor. yet it seemes to be nothing, vnlesse
it be set foorth with ceremonies, with rich and costly
apparell, the Harold
                  •
                attending with bannors, scut
                  •
               heons,
and armes, counterfeit and supposed titles, many
Pages, Vshers and officers of honour appointed; such
chaires and cloathes of estate, cups of grace serued on
the knee, the seruants rankt in their order, such strict
and precise formes of salutation; and if all this will not
serue, then open and plaine flatterie, and all manner of
lying and grosse cos'ynage. But I pra'y looke to their

persons, and you shall finde them some old crasie bodies,
troubled with gowtes and with palsies, who take
little ioy or contentment in al their honour, and would
very willingly exchange it for a little health. Heere
then I see, that a poore mans condition is farre better
then theirs, and much to bee preferred before theirs:
little would you thinke, that men of such account, so
much talked of, should be of such a stature and personage.
            Thus it should seeme, that the Ceremoniall law is
no way abolisht, but onely translated from the Temple
of the Iewes to the palaces of our Nobles. All their honour
consists in shewes, and in ceremonies; and therefore
wee may well feare, that they haue but onely the
shew of honour.The true Honor of Christ. For there was true honour indeede,
which appeared in the basenesse of this world, and imparted
honour to the most dishonourable creatures;
God and man, power and weakenesse, Maiestie and humilitie
together subsisting; the homely manger was a
fit subiect for the song of Angels; and the most ignominious
crosse must be the onely signe of victorie and
triumph: for 
                  •
               ee wanted no thrones to set foorth his
greatnesse, being all glorious in himselfe, though shadowed
in the vaile of our flesh; hee wanted not the
helpe of the creatures, though otherwise he might haue
commanded many legions of Angels to attend him;
his honour was in himselfe, and not in him that ascribed
the honour. And therefore being not able to look
vp to his Throne, I will heere fall downe at his foote-stoole,
here I will worship: for I had rather be a doore-keeper
in the house of my God, then to dwell in the
Tents of vngodlinesse. Thus setting true honour before
mine owne eyes, I will yet a little further discouer
the vanities of our worldly and temporall honour.
            Suppose that a stranger, or one vnacquainted with

these honourable courses, should bee admitted in the
time of some great feast, (as the manner is) to see the
fashions and conditions of the place, I pra'y, obserue,The feast of honor.
with what state and formalitie their meate is serued vp,
what exquisite dishes, varietie of sauces, how many
courses, how well it is ordered, what banketting stuffe,
and plentie of sweete meates! The English fowle embalm'd
with the Indian spice, the delicious Carp swimming
in a sea of sweete broth, the red Deere harbour'd
in a nut-browne coffin, the Phesant onely commendable
for her price; here are the creatures (I confesse) in
abundance. But now, where is the vse of these creatures?
See how this honourable Lord sitting in all his
state, calles at length to his Caruer, for the legge of a
Larke, or the wing of a Partridge, and so rests satisfied;
complaines of his weake stomacke, vseth his hot waters,
&amp;c. How much are wee bound vnto God, whose
condition though meane and inferiour, yet wee haue a
sufficient plentie of Gods creatures; in stead of their
sauces, wee haue our hunger and good appetite; and to
these creatures God hath giuen that hidden qualitie,
as that they are fit to nourish our bodies; a strange
wonder in nature, that dead creatures should preserue
life: and hauing thus both substance and qualitie, God
hath giuen vs the free vse of these creatures, that wee
may take them in full measure with moderation, while
he himselfe sanctifies both them and vs, and giues a
blessing to both.
            As it is in their feasts, so it is in their funerals; as it is
in their liues,The funerals of honor. so it is in their deaths: nothing but dumbe
shewes. I neuer see Sir Christopher Hattons tombe (because
I haue named the Gentleman, and that I desire
that all things may bee spoken without offence, I will
giue him his due praise and commendation; in his time
he was a very honourable minded man, no practising

statesman, first contriuing, and then very wisely discouering
his owne plots: but of faire and ingenious conditions,
highly fauoured of his Prince, and generally
beloued of the people; and one to whom the present
Church of England, is as much indebted in true loue
and thankfulnes, as to any lay subiect that euer liued in
this kingdome): when I see his tombe, me thinkes hee
should not bee like the ordinarie sort of our men, such
huge commendations, such titles, such pillars, such gilding,
such caruing, such a huge monument, to couer so
small a body as ours it cannot be. Send for the Mazons,
will them to bring hither their instruments and

let vs take his proportion: But stay your hands, I will
saue you all that labour, for I will tell you in briefe (if

few rotten bones, and a handfull of dust; some crawling
wormes, which haue deuoured this great little man,

or rather doe the liuing heires and suruiuors intend
their own glorie in the tombe of their ancestors? Well,
howsoeuer liuing or dead, man is altogether vanitie,
deluding the world with shewes; and making great appearance
of things, which are small in themselues.

            Consider (I pray') their great trouble and paines;
such violent labour, such dangerous riding; the high

of garments, the tearing of flesh, the breaking of legs,
the cracking of bones, their liues are not alwaies secured,
and thus they continue the whole day; sometimes
thorough stormes and tempests, sometimes enforced
to wade thorough riuers and brooks, fasting sweating,
and wearied only with a conceit of their bootie (heere
is excellent sport indeede): if they were to be hired,
they would neuer vndertake such troublesome and
dangerous courses; then it would seeme to bee a meere
slauerie, as indeed it doth to their seruants and followers,
who must attend their Lordships, and partake with
them in their whole sport, but not in any part of their
pleasure. In truth according to right reason, I should
preferre the life of a Carrier or a Poste, farre before
theirs; with what speed doe they gallop? I could wish
they would g
                  •
               ue me leaue to aske them one question,
wherein consists the sport and delight in hunting? some
say in the noise and crie of the Hounds; others in their
carefull curiositie and search in the pursuite; others in
the exercise of their owne bodies, and in their hope of
the bootie. I do not like this varietie of opinions; shall
I resolue you this one point? the pleasure which you
so hotly and eagerly pursue in the chase, consists in the
phansie and in your owne apprehension; what a vaine
thing is it to seeke for that in the woods, which indeed
consists in your braine? ye carrie it about you, and run
to ouertake your owne shadow. This is a pleasure, because
you conceiue it so; perswade your selues alike of
any labour or trauaile, and you shall finde a like ease
and contentment. If the world were so perswaded, if it
were the course and fashion of the times, to delight in
religious exercises, and in the actions of pietie and deuotion,
to lift vp our hearts and our voyces to God in a

melodious quier, to temper our passions according to
the sweete harmonie of the organ-pipe, to practise the
works of charity; and in stead of the cry of the hounds,
to hearken to the cries, to the blessings and prayers of
poore people: assuredly wee should finde farre greater
ioy and contentment, (I speake according to the carnall
and naturall man, without reference to the inward
comfort of Gods spirit, which is a benefit vnualuable)
then now wee reape in these outragious, troublesome,
dangerous and bloodie sports, which wholly sauour of
crueltie.
            As we are deluded in their sports, so likewise in their
persons: I had thought that Huntsmen and Faulconers
had been in the nature of our Heardsmen; but in truth,
they are well mounted and horst,Of Huntsmen. as if they were appointed
for some seruice of warre, all apparelled in
greene, like the sonnes of May; they can talke and discourse
of their forrest lawes, of state matters, and newes
at Court; they haue their words of Art, their rules, and
certaine notions belonging to their profession: and
were it not for such formalitie and ceremonies, the
sport would be little respected.
            Thus briefly in effect, Beautie is as a fading flower,
and serues to incense lust: Honour increaseth pride, the
height makes greater the downfall: Wealth breedes
carefulnes, deiects the minde, and makes man a slaue:
Learning tends to confusion, great wisedome rather
breedes a distaste, and a dislike in nature, then giues any
contentment: All pleasures consist in the fansie, according
to mans owne apprehension. Now proportion
these fiue seuerall qualities, to the fiue seuerall senses of
mans bodie; wisdome to the sent, beautie to the sight,
honour to the eare, wealth to the touch, pleasures to the
taste. Suppose a man to consist of fiue senses, and to
haue the full measure of these fiue seuerall obiects; yet

certaine it is, that all the ioyes in the world can giue his
heart no true contentment; but the least sorrow and
griefe deiects the high minde, and brings downe his
courage. If thou haddest wealth, more wealth thou requirest,
and in euery action an excesse is distastfull; but
if in the middest of all thy ioyes, the least griefe should
assault thee;The least sorrow spoyles all our ioy. suppose thou wert an absolute Monarch,
and haddest the gouernment of the whole world; that
thou diddest ride vpon the shoulders of men, carried in
triumph, treading vpon thy captiues and slaues; that
thou haddest all carnall and al possible pleasures, which
nature could affoord thee: yet if thy tooth did but ake,
if thy naile were but sore, if thy little finger were
scorcht with the fire, (for I will not speake of those
more noble parts, the eye, the heart, the braine, the liuer,
and the rest), assuredly thou wouldest iudge thy
selfe a most miserable man, and shouldest take little ioy
or conten

               ment in all those sports and delights.
            Suppose thou couldest distill all thy pleasures, and
free them frō sorrow, as it were separating their drosse,
so that many whole and entire perfections should bee
linckt in thy person;One ioy suppres
                     •
                  eth another. yet obserue, how one ioy seemes
to preuent, ouertake, and to extinguish the other. Whē
thou sittest at table to meate, then farewell the delight,
which thou tookest in thy morning exercises &amp; sports;
now thou must intend to please thy daintie and delicious
palate: at length, for feare of a surfet, farewell the
sweete sinne of gluttonie; the afternoone will serue to
visit to thy friends, but as thou commest, so there must
be a time of departure; as was thy ioy, so must be thy
sorrow, the one will easily recompence the other. Vpon
thy returne thou callest to thy stewards and clerkes,
to see the accounts of thy house; the ouerplus and surplusage
of thy rents and estate▪ this indeede reioyceth
thy heart, and thus thou passest from ioy vnto ioy, the

whole time of thy pilgrimage. Suppose thou wert confinde
to any one of these delights, thou wouldest think
thy life but a slauerie; so then thy delight consists onely
in the varietie. Suppose any mans minde were not so
stragling, and extrauagant as thine, but that hee could
tie himselfe and limit his owne thoughts; certainly he
should receiue as much contentment in one, as thou
dost in many. What doth this argue, but only that man
(forsaking the fountain of all true goodnesse, in whom
all ioyes are together knit and vnited, that enioying
him alone, wee might haue all fulnesse of ioy and contentment,
not by degrees, not in varietie, not in succession,
but altogether in euery moment of eternitie) Man
hauing lost this onely one good, seekes againe for the
same good, in the shadow thereof, thorough many
chaunges and alterations, and not finding the same
good, desires to please himselfe with varietie?
            Suppose the whole day were spent in iolitie and
mirth,All ioyes are nothing without the nights rest. yet if thou diddest but want thy nights rest, al
were nothing. Lord, how thine owne thoughts would
torment thee! how long and tedious would the time
seeme! how often wouldest thou wish and expect the
light of the morning! then thou beginnest to acknowledge,
that of all the ioyes in the world, there is none
comparable to a sweete sleepe; sleepe, which refresheth
the wearisome limmes, renewes and quickens the faculties
of the minde, restores the bodie to her wonted
strength, (it seemes as an excellent embleame of the
last resurrection), for in the day time our sports do proceed
with consuming of our spirits, the decay of our
strength, the weakning of our parts; but sleepe must recompence
all. Haue I wrung out a confession? Now
giue me leaue to worke vpon it. What is sleepe, but the
image of death? a want of sense and of motion, not
capable either of ioy or of sorrow. If our greatest contentment

rest in our rest, and sleepe bee our greatest
blisse; then our greatest ioy consists in the priuation of
all ioy, and in the want and absence of delights, consists
the perfection of delights. As-much in effect, as if I
should say, it were better to haue no ioyes at all, then to
be fraught and filled with ioyes; for our ioyes are but
toyes, and the delights of this life are as the dreames of
a shadow without stayednesse, foundation or consistencie.
            If there be any ioyes in the creature, O the wonderfull
ioyes of him that created!The ascent of the mind vnto God, by the ladder of the creatures. hee is the fountaine of
ioy, and these are but drops: he is the sunne of ioy▪ and
these are the rayes, or the beames which he imparts vnto
nature. If I loue beauty, I will first loue him, and
fasten mine eyes vpon him, that is the fountaine of
beauty, and beauty it selfe: if I loue honor or wealth,
I will looke vpon him, who sits aboue in maiesty,
heauen is his throne, the earth is his footstoole, whose
treasures are infinit, who makes all things of nothing,
he can enlarge his owne Empire, create many infinite
worlds for his owne gouernment. Hee that is proud of
his owne wealth or his honor, is indeed base minded, to
content himselfe with so base an element as the earth;
our pride and ambition lookes much higher, aboue the
starres, where God sits in perfect glory; where all the
hallowes of heauen are clothed with happines and honor;
here is the marke and scope of our desires, here we
may claime our right by inheritance: for here we haue
our part and portion with them; there is but little ioy in
the creature, all an infinitie to that little ioy: and so thou
shalt worship God in the creature, let it not hinder our
search or our hope, for it is but an earnest or forerunner
of that future ioy to secure vs of happines; non ancillam
ament, qui dominam ambiunt, if we come as suters to the
Mistris, let vs scorne to fall in loue with the handmaide.
            
               This I speake, supposing there were some ioy in the
creature, which if there were any, thy minde might be
transported and carried, by the ladder or bridge of the
creatures, to the loue of thy creator. For as it pleased
God to ordaine a ceremoniall law, differing from the
naturall law, according to the wisdome of his owne
institution: so assuredly the minde of man, which delights
in nothing so much as in mysteries, may make
whole nature a ceremony, and all the creatures tipes
and resemblances of spirituall things; for thus the land
of promise did figure out the heauenly Ierusalem, and
this I cannot dislike in the practise of any mans priuat
deuotion.
            But I must call to mind my first intention, which
was to proue that the ioy of the creature was only vanity,
and this shal appeare by these three circumstances.
1. The variety of mens iudgements in the choice of
their owne happines, which certainly proceeds from
the fansie; for right reason hath but one only foundation,
and God will not admit any difference. 2. This
their conceited or supposed happines neuer consists in
the present; insomuch that man can neuer say vnto himselfe
now I am happy: but his happines is alwayes either
past, gon and already spent, or els comming in expectation;
like some desperat debt, when faire promises
serue for our payment. 3.3. Grounds to proue that there is no happinesse in this world. Few or none will euer acknowledge
themselues to haue bin happy, but yet still
are verily perswaded, that there is some happines,
though not in the state and condition of life, which
they themselues doe professe: as if there were some
common fame or report of some new wonder, that
should be, which indeed neuer was; and inquisition being
made, for the triall of the truth, euery man layes it
to an other mans charge, and no man dares stand to
iustifie it.
            
               He that shall peruse Aristotles Ethickes, will wonder
how it is possible, that there should be so many seuerall
opinions concerning happines;1. The variety of opinions concerning happinesse. when as the end
of man, whereunto euery man is ordained seemes to be
that happines. And strange it is, that man alone should
so much mistake himselfe in his owne end; and yet
Saint Austen sets downe a far greater number of different
opinions concerning happines. To let passe the
heathen Philosophers, and to suffer them to oppose
each other▪ that so being mutually weakned, the Christian
man may with more ease carry the triumph: Consider
I pra'y the daily actions of men, some intend nothing
but their pleasures and sports; others their greatnes
and honor; some drudge for their wealth, others
desire to seeme valiant: Many men whose pride exceedes
their wit, will boast of those things in themselues,
which notwithstanding in others they hould very
meane, base and contemptible. If they haue no good
parts of their owne to commend them, then they will
boast of their bloud and their parentage; while others
flatter themselues with this conceit, that although they
carry no great outward shew in the world, nor are not
much regarded, yet their wealth is greater then it is
vsually taken for, &amp;c. Some know how to make themselues

               nd trimme, and are proud of their beauty
and comlines, and doe expect wonders in their marriage:
and sometimes they are proud of their clothes and
apparell, and therein they commit a point of iniustice,
to seaze vpon that glory, which belongs to another:
for the worme should brag of his silke as of his owne
excrement; and the taylor should boast of his fashions.
And some there are, who wanting all these, yet supposing
themselues to haue a good naturall wit, begin to
condemne nature, that hath not proportioned all her
gi
                  •
               ts accordingly. I could bee infinit in this kinde of

vanitie, but Poets and Players daily discouer it; and
therefore I will ease my selfe of that labour.
            Suppose we did agree for the qualitie, what it were
to be happie, then let vs search for the person;2. No man accounts himselfe happy for the present. where
is this happie man, who might bee said for the present
to enioy this happinesse? It is a common prouerbe, that
young men liue in their hopes, old men in their memories;
it should seeme that young men haue not (as yet)
strength to shoot so farre as the marke; (for all aime at
happinesse): and it should seeme that old men shoot
beyond the marke; for they can discourse what they
haue been with their bowes and their arrowes, at the
siege of Bullen. Thus young men, and old men, are generally
excluded from happinesse: and speaking of
young and old, I must needs include the middle age,
or the middle sort of men, as according to our naturall
course, so according to the course of our misery. For
happinesse is the end of man; now if any should attaine
his owne end, or his owne proper place, assuredly hee
would rest satisfied, and contented therein. But it is as
proper to man, as is the nature of man, to bee full of
change and variety; hee neuer rest, but is altering his
buildings, changing his garments, intending new
courses; as if hee were to find out some new passage, a
shorter cut vnto happinesse, wherof the ancients were
ignorant. Lord, how hee flatters himselfe with vaine
hopes! sometimes of himselfe, sometimes of the
young child in the cradle; if his debts were but payed,
he would liue very happily and well; if his mother in
law were gone, his estate would bee great; though
now he liues in some pouerty and want, yet he hath an
old kinsman that intends to make him his heire: mundus
vult decipi, men desire to be flattered, and for want
of parasites, they will flatter themselues. I haue seene
the gray beard, gape after the death of his young nenephew,

and to expect the inheritance for want of issue
male to succeed: thus waking we dreame, and can discourse
of the shortnes of mans life, expect the departure
of others, but for our selues we finde little change or alteration
in our bodies: we deceiue our selues with our
owne yeares, our constitution, or calling to minde the
long liues of some of our parents: others sickned indeed
and died by accident, casualty, and chance, but we will
preuent that in our selues.
            Thus is the world deluded with hopes, and men goe
a whoring after their owne inuentions; the person is as
vncertaine as is the qualitie, for wee cannot resolue
what happines is, nor doe we know where to finde out
that happy man (I speake onely of such a happines as
may be competent and agreeable to our present condition):3. Denying happinesse in our selues, do suppose it in others.
for as yet I neuer hard any man account himselfe
happy, but still something was wanting, and yet we are
well perswaded, that there is some happines in nature,
and therefore we would charge others to be happy in
respect of our selues; vberior seges est alienis semper in
agris, alwayes thy neighbours ground is better then
thine, he is the hapyy man, and thou art the wretch.
Sometimes this preiudicat opinion is not sufficient, and
therefore the world is full of complaints: Princes must
erect Courts of request, as if therein men did seeme to
accuse their owne condition, to lay the whole burthen
of their griefe vpon others, and therefore did flie vnto
mercy, for succour and reliefe. If neither opinions nor
complaints will suffice, then in others you shall obserue,
a more malitious and treacherous nature; for
they are apt to enuie and maligne other mens good
fortunes, and enuy doth alwayes accompany greatnes:
our corrupted nature seemes to stir vp a kind of emulation,
for all things here stand in reference to others, the
height and greatnes of the one, makes for the basenesse

and pouerty of the other; no prince can subsist without
subiects, no Lord without slaues, no master without
seruants; the one is apt to wrong and oppresse, the
other to enuie and reuolt, and in both you shall discerne
natures corruption.
            Still we desire to comfort our selues that there is
some happines, that so we might receiue ioy though
not in the present possession, yet in the hope or expectation.
And to this end, see the cunning &amp; subtile

Happinesse it should seeme is buried, no man is happy
before his death: as if a man should then account him
selfe happy, when he is past his account, and lies in the
graue, (I speake according to the naturall man); &amp; this
procrastination of happines, I suppose to be an absolute
deniall of happines, for indeed nature cannot supply it.
And this appeares, not only in the seuerall persons of
men, whō you may taxe with affections, &amp; who might
mistake in their ends; but consider whole mankind, and
you shall obserue, yt some nations thinke other nations
to be happy, in respect of themselues: stockes, families &amp;

            Seeing we are thus well perswaded of other mens

some dislike with our owne), I cannot sufficiently discharge
mine owne dutie and conscience, vnlesse I shall
speake of those miseries, which are proper and peculiar
to euery state in particular.Miseries in all the states of men. As I hope I shal not prouok
whole mankind against me, when I discouer their fall
and corruption; so (without exception) I may speake of
the vices and miseries of each state in particular. For it
is proper to misery, to groane; proper to sinne, for to cry
for vengeance; neither misery nor sin can long be concealed:
and it is our greatest misery, that we thinke it a
shame and a disparagement to our selues to haue them
discouered. We are not ashamed of the corruption,
but that it should be made manifest, here is our griefe;
whereas the first degree to the cure, is the right knowledge

the deeper you sinke in the one, the more remote
you are from the other. Suppose these worldly ioyes to
be the shadowes of true ioyes, (as indeed they are no
more then the shadowes), if I set the shadow before
me, then the light is behind me; if the light be before
me, the shadow is behind me; respecting the one, I neglect
the other: the loue of heauen and of earth cannot
together subsist,The loue of heauen and earth cannot together subsist. no man can serue two masters. The
shadow of the earth causeth the eclipse of the Moone;
and the Moone very fitly resembles the state of man, as
being the lowest of the celestiall Orbes, and in regard
of her mutable and changeable condition. If I desire to
prepare man for a heauenly blisse, needes I must first
weane him from the moderate loue of his owne fl

laying open the miseries which are incident to whole

mankind, from which no state is exempted; herein I
shall follow the example of God himselfe, who mixeth
all our ioyes with the spice of sorrow: and in the
last clause of our liues before our death, (desiring then
especially to draw vs to himselfe), his prouidence hath
so appointed, that long diseases should better instruct
vs of the true state of this world, then all our experience
in the whole course of this world. Then we see our
weakenes, our miseries, and what we are in our selues;
then we see the vanity of all our worldly ioyes, that so
detesting and abhorring them, (esteeming them no otherwise
then indeed they are), our whole comfort
might reside in the onely hope of his mercy, and we be
as willing to forsake this world, as euer we were to enioy
it.
            Thus necessity may seeme to enforce me, that I leaue
nothing vnsearched, where happines might be concealed
or hid; consider likewise the principall intent of
this Treatise, for I did propose vnto my selfe foure
things in this second part. 1.The author proposed foure things to himselfe in this second part. That in discouering our
miseries, both in our selues and in respect of the creatures,
we might truly confesse them to be the punishments
of sin. 2. That our miseries being once discouered,
and we our selues being truly acquainted with the
state of our nature, wee might take some dislike and
distaste in nature; whereby from the depth of our sorrow,
we might haue safe refuge to the depth of Gods
mercy. 3. Least there should bee any obstacle in the
way to hinder our approch vnto God, I thought fit, to
set our owne tents and Tabernacles on fire, to make
our home-bred ioyes and delights vanish in smoake:
for they are but vanities, such as should not with
                  •
               hold
vs from the pursuit of our happines. 4. That being
touched with the miseries, and no way puffed vp with
the vanities, we might acknowledge God in both, expecting

a time of liberty and freedome; when God
shall wipe away the teares from our eyes, and according
to his mercy, in stead of this shadow, shall impart the
truth of his happines.

things, so here especially I shall be most defectiue; least
an offence should be taken where an offence is not giuen.
God forbid, that I should so far wrong mine owne
soule,The particular miseries of man, are greater then the generall. and mine owne conscience, as that I should iustly
offend the least of my brethren: though true it is,
that sore backes must not be touched; yet if I shall intend
the cure, needs I must lance the impostume. Suppose
I should speake of their miseries, with great diligence
and good obseruation; yet certaine it is, that as
the actuall sinne of euery man in particular, is much
more grieuous then his originall: so assuredly the
iudgements, which befal euery priuat man in particular,
are much greater then these, which are incident to the
whole nature in generall. And of these particular punishments,
I cannot take any due knowledge, but must
leaue them tanquam terram remotam incognitam, to be
searched out by the godly and daily meditation of euery
religious and deuout man; who in the clause and
latter end of the day, calling himselfe to the account of
his forepassed life, together with the actions of that
present day, shall therein finde the vndoubted fruit o

teares, all our sobs and our sighs confessing our sins.
            For the common sort of men, I might well reckon

them among beasts, vulgus hominum, inter vulgus animalium,
               The poorer sort of men.
they are alwayes carried with shewes and neuer
apprehend ye truth, their delights are al beastly, they
seeme not to haue the least sparke of a spirit; this common
sort is likewise the poorest sort, so that generally
man is very needy and poore, though otherwise he is ashamed
of his pouerty; and seeing that man requires
more helpes, then the rest of the creatures, as clothes
for his nakednesse, physicke for his health, a house for
his habitation, therefore the wants of men are far greater
then the wants of the creatures. For I haue often
seene and obserued in the streets, an ould blinde decrepit
man full of sores, and inward griefe; hungry, naked,
cold, comfortlesse &amp; harbourlesse, without patience to
sustaine his griefe, without any helpe to releiue him,
without any counsell to comfort him, without feare of
Gods iustice, without hope of Gods mercy, which as at
all times, so most especially in such distresse should be
the sole comfort of a christian man. I protest before
God that were it not, for the hope of my happines, and
that I did truly beleeue the miseries of this life, to be
the iust punishments of sinne, I should much prefer
the condition of dumbe creatures, before the state of
man.
            For the better sort of men (for so the world accounteth
them) I meane the rich men of this world, if borne
to great fortunes, then they neuer vnderstand their
owne happines, for contraries are best knowne by their
contraries;The better sort of men. they are right miserable men, because they
neuer tasted of misery, they know not plenty, because
they know not penury. Lands of our owne purchase,
houses of our owne building, are alwayes best pleasing
vnto vs; what hath descended by inheritance, vix ea
nostra voco: as we know not the paines in the getting,
so commonly we doe not taste the sweetnesse in the enioying;

if otherwise from base and meane condition
they be raised, they shall finde it a great difficulty with
the change of their fortunes, to change their owne
mindes, and to forget their first selues; they shall hardly
learne the art of magnificence. And generally in the
rich men of this world, when I consider the largenes of
their meanes, how it serues to many of them, as fuell to
their luxury and riot, insomuch that they doe not number
halfe their dayes, but in the middle course of their
age, they are tormented with coughes, with aches, with
gouts, with dropsies and stones; and that which I haue
obserued in some of them, the greatnesse of their estate
entaild and descending vpon them, cannot counteruaile
some hereditary disease, which they likewise receiue
from their parents: in truth I doe not enuy their
estate, for I am verily perswaded, that there may bee as
much contentmēt and happines in the poorest cottage,
as in the greatest pallace. But I will descend more particularly
to the states of men, only insisting in the more
noble professions of men, which seeme to be the happy
callings here vpon earth, and wherein they place their
happines, I will shew their misery.
            
               Iudicium incipiat à domo Dei, I should first begin
with the house of God; but I pray' pardon me, if I forbeare
to speake of the grieuances and complaints of the
Cleargy:The Clergy. they are many, in stead of the ancient priuiledges,
and liberties of the Church, which seeme to be
grounded in nature, in regard of the high excellencie
of their profession, and therefore haue bin practised among
all nations, but principally expressed in the Leuiticall
lawe; and so translated from the Synagogue to
the Church, obserued in all ancient times, in the Primitiue
age. It were to be wished that they had but the
common libertie of subiects; for all others, they haue
their voyces and suffrages in making their own lawes▪
               
the husbandmen in the choice of their Knights; the
Trades-men in the choice of their Burgesses; it were to
be wished that the Clergy were not wholy excluded;
being indeed more subiect to penall lawes, then any
other state in the kingdome.
            
               Pannormitan saith▪ 
               Laici semper sunt infensi clericis;
it should seeme, that together with the head, the members
are crucified▪ crucified not alwayes in bloud, but
with shame and with contempt; while souldiers cast
lots for our garments, the reuenewes of the Church
made a prey for the infidell: yet I do not doubt of Gods
mercy, but they shall receiue the full benefit of our labours,
notwithstanding they hate our persons, and despise
our profession; for so we our selues haue iustly deserued.Their comfort.
Doe they contemne vs? God forbid, but wee
should more contemne our selues, for we preach and
professe mortification; dust we are, and therefore fit to
be troden on, to sustaine all iniuries and wrongs; dust
we are, and therefore fit to bee scattered with euery
winde, subiect to the blastes and reproches of euery
foule mouth. But least our enemies should herein reioyce;
let them know, that it is a part of our duty, to
despise their despite, to neglect their neglect, to contemne
their contempt. And therefore here is our comfort,
(a comfort only proper &amp; peculiar to priesthood),
though we are incompassed with thornes, yet we can so
winde and twist these thornes, as that wee can make
them a crowne of thornes; wee can extract an oyle of
gladnes and ioy, out of the middest of affliction and
sorrow: if thornes tend to our paine, yet our glory
shall consist in a crowne, in a crowne of thornes: I will
now come to the gentrie, which is generally reputed,
as one of the happie states in the kingdome.
            A strange iudgement hath lately befallen them;
while they continued in their owne countries, kept

great houses,The Gentrie. much hospitalitie, attended on with
troupes and numbers of seruants, their tenants liuing
happily vnder their shadow, certainly they liued in
great honor and plenty. But now, since they haue so
much improued their estates, ra'ckt their poore tenants,
giuen ouer house-keeping, and liue retiredlie,
scarce any of them, that liue within the compasse of their
owne meanes; but euery man outstrips his owne fortunes,
carrying a saile too great for the burthen of his
vessel; in so much that forraine nations do iustly wonder
at the dissolute gentry of England.
            The trueth is, that this retired life of the gentry;
drawes with it far greater charge and expense, then
was formerly spent in hospitallity: not only because it
giues occasion,Their miseries. to their dissolute gaming, and riot: but
many houses being kept, for the seuerall seasons of the
yeere, proue very chargeable; the furniture belonging
to the house, neuer so curious and exquisit; such cubbords
of plate, such hangings, cushions, and needleworke;
the apparell so costly and chargeable, the diet
so delicat, as reiecting meate of the shambles, and feeding
on out-landish fruites, spices, and wines: all their
other attempts seasoned with vaine glory, and a fond
opinion of their owne reputation and honor; together
with an affectation of titles, proue the more chargeable:
in so much, that the fourth part of that charge, being
spent in home-bread and country prouision, would in
a far more ample manner suffice. And surely it would be
more agreeable to our nature, for if these outlandish
commodities had bin so befitting our bodies, certainly
God in his wisdome and prouidence, would haue disposed
our climat accordingly; what a madnesse or folly
were it in vs, to seeke to equall other nations in their
owne wa
                  •
               es? We must conforme our selues to the soyle,
and not thinke to reduce nature to our wils and appetites:

or if in the times of warre, when force, violence,
and bloud-shed seru'd for the payment, some
might haue their commodities in a more plentifull
manner; yet in peaceable times, whē things are bought
at a valuable price, and wares exchanged for wares,
there being such a difference in the valuation of both,
it seemes to be intollerable. The ancient glory of England
did consist in the strength of our Countrie, in the
multitudes of our seruants, and in the most abounding
and plentifull prouision; and herein wee doe as farre
exceed them, as they doe vs, in their silkes, their spices,
their oyles, or their wines.
            A second vanitie in our Gentrie, is, their needlesse
and vnprofitable buildings, especially when Citizens
turne Gentlemen,Their needlesse buildings. they will not endure any longer to
be incaged within their owne shops; they must haue
full elbow-roome, and their buildings must raise their
names, &amp; continue their memories, being (as it should
seeme) otherwise somewhat meane and obscure in
themselues. Thus they build great houses, and keepe
small houses; which seemes to imply a contradiction,
were there not an inside, and an out-side; for an house
doth not onely consist of walles and foundations. And
sometimes they build, when they cannot keepe, and
commonly they are ouertaken with their owne buildings;
the imperfect worke standing at a stay, for want
of money to pay the workemen; while the neighbours,
and passengers smile at their indiscretion and improuidence.
But suppose these buildings were finished,
whereas the delight should consist in the vse, it falles
out farre otherwise; and argues rather a giddie minde,
desiring imployment, together with a dreame of ioy,
conceiued in the imagination, then any sufficient
meanes to giue them contentment: for seldome or neuer
doe they enioy their owne labours, but either tenants

suffer them forthwith to decay, or else their
charge is continued (being absent) in maintaining their
buildings. The vnthriftie and prodigall heire is sooner
allured to the sale; and in his sale, hath seldome relation
to their charge in the building.
            In their estate of land, how exceedingly doe they
perplexe themselues with their continuall purchases?
if they could but procure a more competent demaine,
they would rest satisfied: when they haue gotten this
demaine, yet still there will remaine a desire to purchase
all that lies in one leauell, all that holds by one tenure,Their fond purchases.
they must enlarge their parkes. And being by these
meanes alwaies bare and needie, wanting for the present,
(though otherwise they may intēd the plentie and
good of their posterity), they must straine themselues
to take vp money vpon hard termes, to purchase their
neighbours ground, for there is but a hedge that parts
it. Assuredly, vnlesse wee shall first inclose our owne
thoughts, and hedge vp our willes, and our appetites,
the whole earth can giue vs little contentment; the
triangle heart cannot bee filled vp and replenished
with the circular earth.
            Not onely in their continuall purchases, but likewise
in their present possessions, how are they troubled
and disquieted in thoughts? For as the mind of
man is griple and needie,Their many writings. and therefore desires to enlarge
his owne substance: so is the same mind doubtfull,
suspitious, and fearefull of any ill accident; and
therefore desires by all possible meanes, to secure her
selfe of her owne. And hence it is, that they so exceedingly
entangle and inueagle themselues, with many
writings, and conueyances, the Scriueners &amp; Clerks are
alwaies imployed; and yet the truth is, that in stead of
securing themselues, through the multiplicity of writings,
they cause starting holes, and giue occasion of

strife. O happie was the old world! when all things
past by word of mouth, or else a few lines subscribed
with the marke of a crosse, and the seale of a tooth did
suffice: when in these daies (I am verily perswaded)
that, what with writings, conueyances, bils of Chancery,
proceedings of Court, the whole land (which we inhabite)
might bee spread ouer and couered, as with a
garment; yet all will not serue for our securitie.
            In their conueyances obserue how curious they are,
the possession is giuen to one, to the vse of another; the
reuersion to a third, in the behalfe of a fourth; with such
nice clauses and conditions,Their nice conueiances. so many prouisoes, such
feoffees of trust; that if a boy, or a Sophister in Cambridge
should propose such notions and ends to himselfe,
we should presently condemne them, as being the
fruits of an idle braine: for speculations must not alwaies
bee reduced to practice; things cannot so well
square outwardly in the actions, as they doe inwardly
in the thoughts. Strange it is to separate the vse from
the thing; as if you would suppose a fruite without a
root: the creatures are ordained onely for our vse, and
more we cannot partake of them then the vse; so that
it is a fallacie in nature, to distinguish one from the other.
Againe, whole nature is corrupted; the more you
intangle your selfe, the more you shal finde the corruption;
the more feoffees of trust, alwaies the worser dealing;
the more executors, the slower execution. Let
your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay; nature contents her
selfe with the fewest instruments, and workes by the
easiest and plainest manner; and this should be a president
for their practice.
            Lastly, how doe they trouble and busie themselues
with entailes? as if they would alter the state and condition
of this world; which being a world of change
and alteration, ex generatione vnius, fit corruptio alterius:
               
They lay deepe foundations, and desire a setled
state of continuance and perpetuitie here vpon earth;
but it is already resolued, that it is easier to dissolue,
then to cōpose.Their needlesse entailes. Nothing can be done by law, which by
the same law cannot be dissolued: &amp; thus their intailes
are either needlesse, or indeed doe cause and stirre vp
such feares and ielousies betweene kinsmen and brethren,
as that they proue to be the only causes, both of
the breach of their loue, and of the sale of their inheritance.
As for example, the least action of the younger
brother, sometimes his absence, or supposed neglect,
is taken so vnkindly, as it is thought to bee done
in regard of the intaile; but (saith the eldest brother)
it lies in my power to cut that short. These words are
carried to the younger; heere begins the practice of
seruants, and other kinsmen, who hope to gaine by his
losse. Words multiplying, giue way to distastfull actions;
first, the wasting of woods, the impouerishing of
the grounds, decay of the buildings; at length it breaks
forth to the cutting off of the intaile: though it bee
chargeable in the doing, yet hee will not forbeare it.
Thus the intaile cannot secure it frō selling, but makes
the sale the more chargeable. And thus God laughs at
the counsels of men, who desiring to erect a tower of
Babel heere vpon earth, God confoundeth their
tongues, and brings their worke to confusion.
            The best kind of intaile is, to haue his goods honestly
gotten; to bring vp his children in Gods feare;The best entaile.
not to acquaint them with any wastfull course of expense;
to leaue a good report behind him, the good
wishes, and furtherance of all his bordering neighbors,
and kinsmen; to leaue his estate not intangled, nor to
ouer-trouble himselfe with these new &amp; strange conueiances;
to leaue it to the sole protection &amp; prouidēce
of God; Domini est terra &amp; plenitudo eius: Lord I giue

thee humble thankes for mine owne vse and employment;
and if my sonnes, according to the flesh, shall not succeede
me; then let thy sonnes, according to the spirit, be heires of
thy promised land, &amp;c.
            Me thinkes I see our Lawyers hold fast to the gentrie;
and therefore I must speake of them in the next
place. If the earth it selfe were stable &amp; constant,The Lawyers. assuredly
they haue laid a very strong and sure foundation.
For as long as hedges and Cottages endure; so long
seis
                  ••
               es, tenures, and trespasses shall continue. But here
is the misery, lex terrae simul cum terra ruet: at the generall
earth-quake and dissolution of this world, when
all hedges and Cottages shall fall, then where shall we
sue for a trespasse?
            Notwithstanding that I am verily perswaded, that
they are as iust, as vpright, as free from briberie and
extortion,Their slanders. and euery way as sufficient and painfull in
their owne profession, as any other state in the kingdome.
For generally I can excuse none, (we must not
expect a state of innocency in a world of corruption)
yet assuredly, no state is more enuied, or maligned, then
theirs: which I cannot altogether ascribe to the corruption,
and ill disposition of others, but euen their
profession it selfe seemes (in some sort) to produce it.
As God speakes, Vae Assur virgae furocis mei: the instruments
of iustice, are alwaies fearfull, but seldome doe
stirre vp true loue, and affection. This enuie and hate
to their persons, hath raised vp many malitious slanders,
and hath laid many false imputations vpon the
profession. For thus it hath been the complaint of all
ages, leges esse telas aranearum, vel quia iuridici sunt araneae,
vel quia muscas capiunt, &amp; vespas dimittunt. But
I am not of their mind; for I thinke, that God in his
prouidence hath so fitly ordained it, as prophecying, or
prescribing a lesson; that the timber in Westminster

Hall, should neither admit cobweb, nor spider: and
God make vs thankfull for the free course of our iustice.
            God forbid that other mens reproches and slanders
should make them miserable. Enuie may follow,
but shall neuer be able to suppresse, or to ouertake the
vertuous and innocent. Then let vs consider them in
themselues,Their harsh studie. in their persons, and in their profession. The
nicities and subtilties of Law, as they doe infinitely exceed
for number; so they come neare, euen for the difficultie
of knowledge, to the highest and profoundest
mysteries of our Christian faith, and religion. The study
it selfe is very difficult and harsh; for the actions of
men, together with the circumstances, being both infinite,
needs the course of their studies must likewise be
infinite. And as the 
                  ••
               ions of men are voluntarie, casuall,
and on the one side 
                  ••
               oceed from an errour; so this
infinite course of their studies, can neuer admit a right
order or method, which in all our naturall knowledge,
giues vs the greatest ease and contentment: but heere,
onely the method of time, according to the variety of
accidents, as things haue fallen out, as cases haue been
adiudged, so their bookes of reports must serue to informe
them. Somtimes again, the iudgements of those
great Sages doe much differ; and the Law doth altar
and varie, as it were ebbing and flowing, according to
the condition of the times and the seasons: notwithstanding
the root and foundation still continue the
same in the heart. Whereas nature can admit no such
variety, but is the same from her first infancie and institution;
and therefore our naturall knowledge, our
Philosophie, hath descended to vs, through a continuall
succession of all ages, without impeachment or contradiction.
            Their practice may truly be called practice, and nothing

but practice; for no state of life is so troublesome
and laborious as theirs:Their troublesome practice. such daies of essoyne, such
daies of appearance; so many writs, so many actions,
so many offices, so many courts, so many motions; such
iudgements, such orders, that I protest before God, if
there were such trouble in purchasing heauen, and procuring
my eternall happinesse, as there is sometimes in
the recouering but of a rood of ground, I should halfe
despaire to attaine it. What throngs and multitudes of
Clients daily attend them? I commend the wisedome
of our forefathers, who close by the hall, erected a
Church, where they might take the open aire, and find
it as emptie, as they left the other peopled, and furnished.
How are they continually busied? I could hartily
wish that there were more minutes in the houre, more
houres in the day, more daies in the weeke, more weeks
in the yeere, more yeeres in their age, that at length
they might find out some spare time to serue God, to
intend the actions of nature, to take their owne ease
and recreation. For now they are ouer busied in their
brickes, and their straw, to lay the foundation of their
owne names and gentility; that teaching other men
their land-markes and bounds, they may likewise intend
their owne priuate inclosures. Welfare the Schollers
contentmēt, who if he enioy nothing else, yet surely
he doth enioy himselfe; valuing himselfe aboue the
price of the whole world: and therin consists the greatnesse
of his wealth, vsing the turbulent waues of his
owne passions, and the sweet calme of his intellectuall
faculties, not distracted with any wandring imployments,
besides himselfe.
            Before I can be dismissed the Court, I pra'y giue me
leaue to make one motion to the Iudges. When they
ride to their Assises, all the whole countrey attends
them, (for they beare the Kings person): the Sheriffes,

the vnder-Sheriffes,The Iudges. Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughs;
all must waite vpon them, with Halbards,
Pikes, Billes, while all the people stand gazing, and beholding
them. Assoone as the great Assises are ended,
and their Lordships gone and departed, then all this
goodly retinue doth presently attend the condemned
prisoners, to guard them, and to see the execution.
When I viewed and considered this, me thought, the
Iudges were either like the condemned prisoners, or
the prisoners like them; for both are attended alike, we
gaze and looke vpon both, and both are alike carried
to the place of execution. The Iudges (I confesse) haue
somewhat the greater distance, and this distance is the
sole difference; for certainly they are carried, the further
they goe, the neerer they approch to the place of
execution: notwithstanding they ride in their circuits,
yet they shall come to a period. In euery great vacation,
some of them drop, and here the Iudges like condemned
men, are now brought to the place of execution;
they that can giue life to others, in sparing their
liues, cannot adde a daies respite to their owne: Iudges
they are, and yet like poore delinquents, they shall
stand at Gods barre, where no appeale shall be allowed
them, and therein their condition is no more then equall
to ours.
            From the suburbes, where I will leaue the Lawyers,
let vs come to the rich Citizens: If now they liue in
plentie and wealth, it is well knowne that (in their
younger yeeres) their wealth hath been gotten by sparing,
thriftinesse and wants;The Citizens. if they please to cast vp accounts,
they shall finde themselues so much indebted
to themselues, as that besides the interest, they shall
hardly bee able to make restitution for the principall.
Now that their stomackes begin to faile them, no marueile
if they bee serued vp with full dishes, and a plentifull

table; for if they would suppose the meate to bee
painted, it would as well suffice their appetites. Now
that they are troubled with gowtes, with palsies, and
the weaknesse of old age, they begin to keepe a stable
well furnisht with horses, as if they were to grow
young againe, and did intend to become horsemen or

vse them, as if their owne crasie bodies were thereby
exercised.
            In telling ouer great summes of money our fingers
grow black: as yet I neuer knew any man, that by his
husbandrie and honest manuall labour could euer attain
to an Aldermans wealth. The Citizens know how
to estimate the laying out of their money, their freedome
and trade, their skill in buying and selling, playing
vpon aduantage with other mens ignorance, and
to vnderualue poore mens labours: yet they must not
take it vnkindly, if sometimes their Charters be called
in question; for the Church hath lost al her priuiledges,Their wealth. which certainly were grounded vpon a farre greater
right. Neither will I examine, whether Companies and
Corporations bee preiudiciall to a publike state; sure I
am, that such societies of men neuer made lawes or orders
amongst themselues, preiudiciall to themselues.
God send that the secrets and mysteries of trades,
(whereof I am wholly ignorant, and which are best
knowne to themselues), may well stand with vpright
and iust dealing. Indeed being once made Magistrates,
then they begin to looke vnto measures, and weights;
and therein wee commend their iustice, and doe well
hope, and doe heartily wish, that their own wealth had
been gotten with like measure. But if by ingrossing of
wares, and monopolizing of commodities, they haue
exceedingly enriched themselues, let them not thinke
with a small summe of money, bestowed upon Hospitals,

to make restitution; for the punishment must alwaies
be answerable to the offence.
            Their daintie liuing makes them the more tender;
being well fed, and warmely clothed, yet they cannot
preuent all vnseasonable weather; and therefore sometimes
they are ouertaken,Their miseries. they sicken and dye, with a
little wet, or a small cold: according to the fashion of
the old world, euery man ought to accustome himselfe
to endure some hardnesse. The greatnes of their wealth
is not alwaies for the safetie of their persons; sometimes
it serues to stirre vp ielousies and feares; full often
haue I seene it scattered by heires and executors. I
commend their wisedome in getting of wealth, if it be
by honest and iust meanes; but I doe not commend
many of their iudgements, who know not, that the
happinesse of wealth consists in the vse. Or rather I will
proue charitable, to thinke them very iust in all their
dealings; iust (I say) if not to all others, yet to themselues:
for knowing that they deserue little, they desire
to bestow little vpon themselues, but to leaue it to others,
who happily may better deserue it. And as it is
gotten, so it is spent; we must passe our inheritance with
the same right and title, wherewith it was purchased:
if it were gotten with dishonestie, assuredly it will bee
spent with dishonestie, res transit cum suo onere. When
all their whole life is past, me thinkes it is like one of
their shewes, wherein Pageants are gazed vpon in the
day time, and in the night are dissolued; the day following
some little remnant is hung vp in their Halles, and
the rest passeth away like a shadow, without any further
mention or memorie.
            Suppose me to be a wandring pilgrime now in the
state of the way, directing my course vnto happinesse. I
should lose my selfe in these thickers and groues, and
should proue very tedious to ye reader,He recals himselfe. vnlesse I should

haue often recourse to my Carde, consider my first intended
scope, and giue an account of my trauell. Hitherto
I haue made a diligent search, where in this
world I might finde out contentment, and happinesse;
or where any true ioy might seeme to inhabite. First I
began with the Church, where I found nothing but ruines,
all in decay, spoyled of her substance. From thence
I went to the fruitful and pleasant soiles, where I found
that the Gentrie were likewise very miserable in their
owne kinde. At length I made bold to speake of the
Law, as if I had been serued vp with a Processe, to appeare
at the barre, where I found no rest, no peace, no
contentment. Then I went to the Citie walles, where
in euery streete, I made inquirie for happinesse, at what
signe this happinesse might dwell, in what trade, course
and condition of life. And receiuing no manner of satisfaction,
yet hearing much talke and newes of the
Court, and of the greatnes of our Nobles, I will presume
to goe, and knocke at the Court gates, there to
enquire, whether true ioy and happinesse be a follower
and attendant of theirs; to what stocke or familie, to
what state or faction, she is chained and vnited; whether
she keepes her certaine lodging, or sometimes vndertakes
a progresse; yet still resides, and is conuersant
with them, or at least with some of them, as the fauour
and fortune of the times shall best serue for their greatnesse.
            When I looke vp to the Nobles, they seeme at first
sight, to bee like starres in the firmament, all clothed
with happinesse and honour; but when I come neerer,The Nobles.
I see that no state of men is so dangerous. Some of thē
in their owne proud and ambitiou
                  •
                desires, preuenting
and supplanting each other; in so much that in stead of
noble bloud, they seeme to consist of quicke-siluer, or
some spirit of bloud: either they must build castles in

the ayre, or else they will pull downe vpon their owne
heads the tower of confusion: they know not the state
of consistencie, that things may exceed as well in their
greatnes and growth, as in their smalnes and diminution.
Looke to the framing and constitution of mans
bodie, all other parts, excepting the head, must haue
their fellowes &amp; their associates in like proportiō with
themselues; feete, legges, thighes, armes, ribs, al of them
haue others equall to themselues: to exceede and to
swell vp, were as great a deformitie and as dangerous,
as to pine and to bee diminished; they must all of them
keep the same proportion, and all come vnder the head,
by the length of a whole necke.
            Be their estate neuer so great, their reuenewes neuer
so large, yet still their charge and expense seemes to
ballance them, if not to exceed them: and all things deducted,
little remaines; which in effect is as much, as if
I had little substance,Their miseries. and lesse vse and employment for
my little substance. The last age hath much eclipsed
their greatnes, reducing as all waters to one fountaine,
all light to one Sunne, so all power and obedience to
one stocke, obseruing an equalitie of iustice to all the
seuerall members vnder one head: for you shall obserue,
that the great offices of the kingdome haue failed,
whose power did seeme to exceede the fit and due
bounds of subiection. The highest titles of dignitie and
honour haue failed: for as in the naturall bodie, so in
the politicall bodie, there should be a certaine distance
between the head and the members; yet still they continue
the spectacles of the world, and sometimes (to
their great charge) they purchase the loue of the people,
which they shall finde, if not dangerous, yet fruitlesse
and wholly vnprofitable. But most commonly
they are subiect to hate, and therefore seruants must be
appointed, as to carrie vp their traines behinde them, so

to support their hate, that they themselues might be secured
from feare, and that the least aspersion of words
might not touch their honors. And sometimes these
seruants though innocent in themselues, and very well
deseruing, (but Lords must not be ouer much indebted
for great seruices) they must be made a publicke example
of iustice; for thus it fals out with nobles, euen from
the time of their infancie, being taught and instructed
by their schoolemasters; others whom they loue, shall
smart and be corrected for their negligence.
            From nobles, I must ascend by degrees vnto Princes,
and if there were any true ioy in the creature, I do suppose
it would be found in their persons: for so the world
esteemes them happy and great. And no maruell, for
they beare the person of vs all, and therefore great reason,
that as we receiue from them our plenty, our peace,
and our happinesse; so we should againe returne and restore
vnto them with due thankfulnes,Princes. as part of our
plenty in our subsidies, our labours and seruices in performing
our homage, to recompence their care and
watchfulnes: so likewise part of our happinesse (for nothing
should be excluded from the royall prerogatiue).
And thus wee should conceiue, that as the princely estate
containes all other states of men within the
Spheare of his gouernment; so it should pa
                  ••
               ake in a
large measure all their happinesse. And as it is the highest
estate heere vpon earth, so it should most freely escape
from these earthly contagions; while the whole
burthen and weight of the miseries doe fall and light
vpon others. And thus in their persons, I might consider
all the happinesse, which is incident to whole mankind:
not presuming to speake of Gods annoynted, without
due reuerence, I will briefly touch their miseries.
            First for their persons, notwithstanding their continuall
intelligence, their watchfulnes and care for the security

of their owne persons and states:Their danger. yet certainly
the poore man in his homely cottage liues with far
greater safety, and sometimes with much more contentment,
then they doe in their royall pallaces. They
haue a guard I confesse, many seruants and officers appointed
for defence of themselues: but here is the
mischiefe, quis custodiet ipsos custodes, who shall guard
them from their owne guard? or who knowes, whether
their seruants receiue any pensions from their enemies?
As they sit highest, and in the greatest view and appearance,
so they serue as the fairest markes to be aimed at.
And therfore in regard of the eminencie of their estate,
and the greatnesse of their personage, amiddest the
throng and multitudes of dangers and perils, many
things may be allowed and tolerated in them, for securing
themselues, which to a man of a priuat condition
were meere iniustice, wrong and oppression. Suppose
the imprisonment or punishment of any one of his subiects,
by way of preuention or caution to an ensuing
mischiefe: this is tolerable I confesse, but herein I feare,
least many Princes haue exceeded the boundes of honesty,
and iustice. Yet I may speake it to Gods glory
and to our owne comfort, the dayes heere in England
were neuer so free from feare and suspition, as they are
at this present, vnder the happy gouernment of our
most gratious King Iames: who herein seemes to excell
all other princes, that so great learning and such a deepe
vnderstanding, should bee accompanied with such a
harmeles and innocent disposition. And this serues for
his best sheild of defence, against all forraine inuasions,
or home-bred conspiracies: God make vs thankefull for
these blessings, and long preserue his raigne ouer vs, &amp;c.
            
            In the times of their wars, the common practise and
desire of Princes is, to ad kingdomes to kingdomes;
which if they should effect,In their wars. with much bloudshed and

slaughter of their people, yet therein they should not
any way increase their owne wealth; they should not
strengthen their power, but should fight with distracted
forces, and make themselues lesse secure of their owne:
imperia mole ruunt sua, kingdomes must haue their
boundes, and I hope (by Gods grace) I shall see the
Turkish Empire fall with his owne weight. Againe in
peaceable times,In peace. and at their owne homes, as all men
desire to obserue and to please them; so sometimes they
desire as much, and shall finde it a worke of far greater
difficulty, to giue contentment to the whole commons
in generall, as their subiects do to them in particular:
and heere is some part of requital, some kinde of recompence,
as all to one, so one to all.
            If their happines consists in their gouernment and
rule, for in all other things their seruants do share with
them, in their diet, their garments, their gardens, their
pallaces, their pleasures: yet all men haue not the like
practicall disposition to delight in gouernment;Wherein their happinesse consists. sometimes
it is committed to others; and there may be an angelicall
contemplation, full of sweet comfort, without
this worldly and troublesome imployment: The last
Roman Emperour was more addicted to his priuat studies,
then to the managing of his owne publicke state.
But suppose, that as Princes are the fountaines of power,
and cannot bereaue themselues of their power, nor cannot
impart an independent power vnto others, they
should therefore take the sole gouernment into their
owne hands; yet sometimes (through a tractable and
good nature) they are easily entreated, I will not say ouer-ruled,
(which is the same in effect) by others; especially
considering, that it cannot stand with their owne
greatnesse, to search all things themselues, and therefore
they must of necessity borrow their information
from others: now here is an excellent point of wisdome,

when vnder colour of aduise and good counsell, wherein
they shall haue thankes for their labour, and rewards
for their good seruice; their seruants shall so cunningly
ouer-rule an action, as that they may worke their owne
ends.
            No maruell, if Princes be very tender in the point of
their prerogatiue; which indeed is so necessary, and so
essentiall to gouernment, as that without it, gouernment
cannot subsist: and therefore it were high presumption
to examine this prerogatiue;Their Prerogatiue. for as it is in the
gouernment of nature, so should it be in mans gouernment.
God indeed hath prescribed certaine bounds to
the creatures, datur maximū &amp; minimum in vnoquoque
genere; but what these bounds should bee, for the iust
measure and limitation, we are wholy ignorant: there
are giants, there are dwarffs, the Ocean sometimes incroacheth
vpon the land, and sometimes the land wins
ground of the Ocean. And thus it is in mans gouernment,
there are arcana imperij, certaine hidden secrets
of state, which ought not to bee discussed or expostulated:
to prescribe a limitation of power, would argue a
kinde of subiection in a free Monarch. If euer question
be made of their power, I will fall downe on my knees,
and desire God to preuent the first occasion; that Princes
in their gouernment, may intend Gods glory, the
good of his Church, the comfort of his people; and
that subiects knowing whose power and authority they
haue, may worship God in the Magistrate, with all humility
and obedience. For if the parts should oppose
themselues to the head, if the hand or the foote should
contend with the eye, what a miserable distraction
should you finde in the whole man? Gouernment
should rather tend to vnity, then be an occasion of strife
and disagreement: let all parts rather striue to gaine
each other, and to preuent each other with mutuall

kinde offices of loue, then contending with needlesse
questions, to disquiet themselues before any iust cause
be offered.
            I say, not to examine the prerogatiue of Princes, or to
what lawes they are subiect; for I will easily yeeld, that
where they are not expresly mentioned, and doe binde
themselues by their owne royall assent, there they are
to be excluded:Their melancholy death. according to the president and plotforme
of nature, semper excipiendum est primum in vnoquoque
genere. Yet sure I am, that they are not exempted
from the miseries and sorrowes of our nature, which
seeme to be incident and common to flesh and bloud;
for nature in making her lawes requires no royal assent,
and this shall appeare by this one instance. I haue obserued
this in my reading, that most of the Princes, and
especially the greatest, if they escaped the cursed attempts
of cruell murtherers and traytors; I say, in most
of them you shall finde, that their death hath bin seasoned
or rather hastened with a griefe of minde, a deepe
melancholy, and a great discontentment. That God
might make it appeare, that there is no true ioy in nature;
that God might let them vnderstand their owne
pride, who being flattered by their seruants and slaues,
did expect that the winde and the sea should obay
them. Hauing neuer learned true christian patience and
humility, though they conquered their enemies, yet
the least griefe did vanquish them; though they subdued
great nations, and ruled great kingdomes yet could
they not rule their owne passions. It is impossible that
a mortall man should be freed from all cause
                  •
                of griefe,
though hee were an absolute Monarch of the whole
world; Princes must learne patience, for amongst all
their prerogatiues, they shall finde none, whereby they
are exempted and excluded from sorrow, which indeed
is incident to the whole nature of man.
            
               Thus heere I haue briefly runne thorough all the
happy states of men, that so I might say with the Apostle,
omnia factus sum omnibus, vt aliquos lucrarer; and
truly I do finde, that God hath inclosed all men in one
common depth of misery. For if ioy (and true ioy) could
bee competent to this our corrupted nature, then certainly
God would neuer haue expelled man paradise:
for heere was the wisdome of God,Wherefore serue our miseries. that whereas blessings
and happinesse could not containe man within
the bounds of obedience, therefore man being thrust
into a vaile of misery, his owne sorrow might inforce
him to crie for succour and releife. That so the iustice
of God might appeare in the iust punishment of sinne,
that so it might serue as a more forcible meanes for
mans repentance and conuersion; for in this sinfull
state, man is more moued with feare and sorrow, then
with thankfulnesse or hope. Though I cannot peirce
the clouds, and open the heauens to shew the maiesty
and glory of God, for no man could euer see God and
liue: though I cannot allure and entice man with a true
relation and discouerie of those heauenly ioyes; though
I cannot oblige and binde man vnto God, in the
chaines and linkes of true loue and thankfulne
                  •
               , by a
serious and weighty meditation of all the blessings receiued
from God, which might concerne either body
or soule, this life or a better life, his creation▪ preseruation,
redemption, sanctification, &amp;c. Yet am I able
in some sort to anatomize the state of man, to lay open
his miseries and griefe, that being once out of the arke,
and seeing these turbulent waues, hee might finde no
resting place, but againe returne to the arke; taking a
dislike and a distaste in nature, he might be thinke himselfe
of his flight, and so finde safe refuge and shelter in
Gods onely protection, and comfort himselfe in the
hope and expectation of a better world to succeed; as all

those run-agates which were discontented with the
gouernment of Saul, were very apt and easily inclined
to flie vnto Dauids campe.
            From the seuerall states of men, let vs come to the
seuerall dispositions of man in himselfe; obserue the
changes and reuolutions of our mindes,The seuerall delights of our age. for (if you
please) we will trace them by degrees, from the time of
our in
                  •
               ancy, how they alter with the course of our age.
First wee begin to delight in crackers and toyes, some
little bable hung about the necke, some corall with siluer
bels, or a little Christall: but these seeme to be the
proper implements belonging to the cradle; they are
indeed the Nurses ornaments, and together with the
cradle they must be left for succession.
            We are no sooner hatched, but presently wee must
haue a feather in the cap, a dagger at the backe; then
in stead of a true paradise,The delights of our childhood. we are brought into a fooles
paradise; wee are made to beleeue, that all is ours; the
land is ours, the house is ours, the goods, possessions, all
are ours: seeme to take away any thing, and the whole
house shall not bee able to containe vs; exclude but
any one fruite, it shal grieue vs more, then the enioying
of all the fruites of the garden can asswage vs. Now at
length begins our sports; for our recreation we runne
puffing, blowing, sweating, and wea
                  •
               ied in hunting after
butterflyes, (here is excellent sport indeed); for our
callings and courses of life, we purchase pinnes, poynts,
and cherie-stones; these we aduēture at seuerall games,
that so very profitably we might increase our stock, our
wealth and our treasure: this is our trade and course of
life, and heere is thrift and frugalitie from the cradle.
But in the meane time giue me leaue to complaine of a
point of iniustice, I protest it is meere iniustice; their parents
and schoolemasters whip them for idlenesse; idlenesse?
what idlenesse? I would they were no more idle

themselues: in truth they doe them great wrong, for
they are as painfull, as earnest, as attentiue to their own
gaine, as possibly any man can be in his ordinarie vocation;
there is as great sorrow in the losse of a poynt,
and as true ioy in the winning of a few pinnes, as if they
were farre better merchandize. If you tell me of the
basenesse of the commoditie; my answere is, that the
whole world is but a point, all is but vanitie, and all
consists in the fansie.
            When our stock after a few yeeres is increased, then
we desire to trade with the merchant-pedler; his packe
is opened, we come to the mart, here wee buy lases and
glasses,The delights of our elder yeeres. bugles and bracelets, ribons and roses; O the
most profitablest member of the Common-wealth!
nothing grieues vs so much, as that we haue not credit,
to take vp money at interest, to buy these rare and excellent
commodities: as for the Schooles, wee cannot
yet be resolued, nor cannot possibly conceiue, why there
should be such places of tormēts appointed for so little
purpose. At length wee are conducted to the Vniuersitie,
where wee begin to admire, the rare and incomparable
learning of a Sophister, who can so punctually
discourse of the elements; though hee wants money to
buy bookes, yet he can dispute of the tincture of gold.
And thus, if I shall runne thorough all the seuerall degrees
of Schooles, from the Lamb-skinne to the Skarlet;
or if I should diuert my course, and consider any other
state and condition of life, the profession of Law,
their Magistrates and officers; the Citizens with their
Companies and Corporations; the Courtiers with their
honours and dignities; I might conclude all with this
one axiome in policie, that things, which consist in appearance,
are greater furthest off, then neerest at hand.
            But I cannot content my selfe, thus to runne through
the courses of our liues, you shall then obserue, the

strange different iudgements in one and the same man,
according to the periods of his age, as concerning the
delights of his age: for as we grow elder and elder, so
we dislike our former condition,The degrees of our age according to decads. and therein seeme to
accuse it of follie. Before wee come to tenne yeeres of
age, we haue no iudgement at al, and therefore we cannot
passe our iudgement; but being come to those
yeeres, wee will not bee handled and dallied like children,
wee will not be so easily led with faire promises,
but we grow head-strong, and thinke our selues wiser
then our teachers. If once wee attaine vnto twentie,
then we make choice of the course of our liues; if any
one shal tell vs of our childishnes, or call vs by the most
opprobrious name of boyes, wee hold it a great disgrace,
a foule shame and disparagement to our selues;
for wee seeme so farre to dislike their sports, that wee
scorne to conuerse with them. Comming once vnto
thirtie, then wee bethinke our selues, that the time is
come, when we might doe the King and the countrey
some seruice, that the world might take notice of our
sufficiencie; we doe likewise thinke of our mariage, to
what stock and familie we might ioyne our selues; and
we affect nothing so much as wisdome and discretion,
that leauing the riotous and dissolute courses of young
men, we might be reputed Sages. When once wee arriue
vnto fortie, then wee begin to feare and distrust,
lest all our former vaine hopes will faile vs; wee will
not so much relie vpon others, but looke to our selues,
be carefull to prouide for our wiues and our children;
enquire after purchases, and desire to enlarge our owne
meanes. When fiftie yeeres are expired, then wee take
thought of placing our daughters in mariage, taking
order to prouide for our youngest sonnes, and here we
begin to affect gouernment; experience hath made vs
wise, we finde the losse of our former errors, and if we

were to begin the world againe, wee would alter our
course, &amp;c. At length six
                  ••
               e drawes on, when all our
care is to settle our estate, that no occasion be left to the
wrangling contention of posteritie; and here we talke
much of the Cl
                  •
               mactericall yeere, and begin to distrust
our owne liues. If seuentie yeeres doe passe ouer, then
we expect the reuerence of fathers, we are froward and
testie and hard to bee pleased; the inward griefe makes
euery outward obiect, seeme to bee a iust occasion of
griefe; we condemne of follie and vanitie, all the courses
of life, all the states in the world, all the actions of
men, accusing the times, when as indeed the alteration
consists in our selues; vntill a length we bid adiew to
all worldly ioyes, and betake our selues to our ease, expecting
our dissolution.
            Suppose a rich man of this world, were now vpon
the point of death, how often should this man bee moued
to make his last Will and Testament,The censure of a dead man. to leaue all
things in quiet and peaceable possession? what writings,
what sealings, what witnesses, how many Scriueners,
how many Lawyers should bee imployed? when
all this time they seeme to neglect that vnum necessarium,
the preparation of his soule for God; that in his
death he might be a true Christian sacrifice, an oblation
f
                  •
               eely offered vp vnto God. Suppose (I pray') that a
few houres were past, and this rich man dead; and that
I could by some strange inchantment raise vp his spirit,
or make this dead man speake: then I would demaund
of him, what hee thought of the greatnes and glorie of
this world. Assuredly he would lesse esteeme of all the
kingdomes, empires, wealth, and worldly honour, then
we doe at this time of the toyes and trifles of children:
and certainly as it is with the dead, in respect of vs▪ so
shall it be with vs in respect of our posteritie; wee forget
them, and our posteritie shall forget vs; wee looke

onely to the present, and therein losing the dignitie of
the reasonable soule, which consists in the foresight, we
are carried like beasts in the strength of our owne apprehension.
            Thus I haue laboured, to shew the greatnesse of mans
miserie in the truth of his sorrow, while all his supposed
ioyes and delights,Wherein mans greatest contentment consists. seeme to be meere vanities, and
to consist in the fansie, and in his owne apprehension;
if you doubt of this, I will alleage certaine instances,
that so it may appeare by experience I would heere
gladly aske, wherein man receiues his greatest contentment?
I suppose either 1. in his sweete conuenient
dwelling and habitation, 2. or in his apparell and clothing,
3. or in his diet and foode, 4. or in his goods and
his substance, 5. or lastly, in the comelinesse of his own
person. These are the things, wherein the mind of man
seemes to delight; which if you please to obserue, you
shall finde that the fansie doth ouerrule all: and as men
doe perswade themselues, according to those ends
which men doe propose vnto themselues; thereafter
they frame and fashion to themselues some kinde of
contentment, supposing that in the creature, which indeed
is bred in their fansie.
            Certainly of al worldly contentments, there is none
like to the home-contentment, wherein the Master disposeth
all things to his best liking;The home-contentment. nothing can displease
him, all his seruants are bound to obey him; he is
as a Prince in his familie, it were pettie treason to offer
violence to his person, his house is his castle; if he takes
the refuge of his house, and his enemie pursues him, he
may lawfully kill him in his owne defence, for heere is
his last refuge. This not only our law allowes, but nature
seemes to imprint it; the least bird in his own nest;
the weakest creature at his own denne, and in his own
home, will set vpon the greatest and strongest, and put

him to flight. There is no contentment to the home-contentment;
and therefore those creatures which
carrie their tents or houses about them, these are supposed
to be the happie creatures, as Snailes, Tortoyes,
Oysters, &amp;c.
            But suppose, that the Magistrate should inforce me
to keepe mine own home, that mine own house should
proue mine owne prison; Lord how I should be perplexed
to lose mine own liberty! all my places of pleasure
should giue me no contentmēt,Our houses are sometimes our prisons. my seruants would
seeme to be my keepers and iaylors, and mine owne
doores would seeme to bee the prison gates: then I
should want elbow-roome, complaine for want of
fresh ayre: what a torment it is to be incaged, &amp; what a
happinesse it is to conuerse and to liue in the societies
of men! See here, there is no change or alteration in nature,
the house is the same, the furniture the same, the
lodging and dwelling the same; only the difference is
in the minde, and the fansie: before we conceiued our
state to be a libertie, and now we thinke it a thraldome
and slauerie; here is the difference, and all consists in
the fansie. Againe, if I were a mercilesse Vsurer, and
that any one of my debtors (for feare of an arrest)
should keepe his owne house, I would gladly aske,
what difference there is betweene his condition and
his imprisonment? and truly this very thought should
moue my hard heart to compassion. Why should the
laitie so much oppose themselues to Church-Sanctuaries?
which might still haue continued in a tolerable
sort: for what were the Sanctuaries but religious prisons?
where true penitentiaries in the thraldome of
their bodies, with mortification and sorrow, might exercise
the actions of pietie and deuotion.
            On the contrarie side, leauing the thraldome of prisons,
let vs come to the sumptuous and magnificent

buildings.The pleasure of the house is according to mans owne apprehension. If a King or a Nobleman shall commit the
keeping of one of his best and fairest houses, to the trust
of his seruant; the house cost many thousands in the
building, the seruant makes choice of his own roomes,
and takes al the delight that the house can affoord him;
the gardens well dressed, the houses repaired, all at his
Masters charge, and himselfe well paied for the keeping:
yet all this will not serue, his life is a slauerie, hee
holds himselfe a drudge for another mans seruice, and
lookes vpon this beautifull building, as his charge or
his trouble, but not as his pleasure. Whereas the good
old Master, that liues in the Citie, fansies to himselfe a
pleasure in his countrie-dwelling: and being merily
disposed, loues to discourse of the conuenient walkes,
and of the neate-contriued buildings; it should seeme
hee sees it with some strange opticke glasses, for his
gowte will not permit him to trauell, and to enioy
these pleasures; or rather he conceiues the platforme,
and builds in his own fansie and imagination. It were
to be wished, that rather he would looke vp to heauen,
and there conceiue an earnest of that ioy, which by the
speciall mercie of God, shall be imparted vnto him, in a
full measure and consummation.
            For our apparell, see how the whole world runnes 
wandring, and gadding, in the strength of their owne
imaginations; euery moneth brings foorth a new fashion,
which for a time seemes to be the best: I must not
stay long vpon fashions,Our delight in our apparell. which alwaies alter &amp; change,
lest I my selfe might proue out of fashion. Let vs search
out for some new stuffe; euery nation, though proud
of her selfe, and boasts of her selfe, and esteemes her self
aboue others, yet she scornes to weare her owne natiue
and home-bred commodities. The English cloath,
which here we neglect at home, when it hath inriched
the Merchant, discharged the custome, and paied for

the carriage, then the Dutchman esteemes it at a high
price; while wee on the other side desire to clothe our
selues with the Naple silke, with farre fetcht and deare
bought outlandish wares. Thus other Countries like
ours, and we like theirs; it may be, we intend to deceiue
each other in the sale: sure I am, though wee differ in
iudgement, yet wee agree in the vanitie, and all of vs
grow wanton in our owne dispositions.
            
                As it is in our clothing, so it is in our food; for fooles
must haue their ladles, aswell as their partie-coloured
coates. When we liue in the Inland countries, then we
begin to long for sea-fish;Our vanitie in our diet. as is the scarsitie and price,
so is our longing and desire; where there is plentie,
there we neglect it. Me thinkes the Colchester Oysters
neuer taste so well, as when they are bought in Northampton:
fresh Salmon at Newcastle is meate for seruants
and colliers, for no man of worth will respect it;
the Phesant in Wales eates no better then a Pulle
                  •
               ; in
London wee desire to feede vpon poultrie, and in our
countrie houses we thirst for a cup of neate wine; wee
temper our sweete meates with sowre sauces: and thus
we are growne wanton. Sometimes when we haue not
whereof to complaine, we will long for fruites out of
season; a few cherries in May shall be sold for their
weight siluer, when in the latter end of Iune, they
shall not be worth the gathering. And thus we desire a
new course of nature, and will not conforme our selues
to Gods appointed good order.
            
                For our goods or our substance; what great varietie
appeares in our choice and estimation?Mans different valuation of his owne wealth. Sometimes the
siluer is raised, sometimes the gold is inhaunced; and
both of them, though otherwise the principall treasures,
yet they follow mans owne valuation: if money
were made of leather, it would be as currant, as if it
were made of the most refined gold. As in numbring,

we vse counters sometimes for digets, sometimes for
hundreds, sometimes for thousands; so is it in mans valuation
of his owne wealth. In some parts of India
copper is respected before gold; and sometimes steele
for their weapons and armour, cannot be bought with
the weight in siluer. What strange difference and varietie
haue I knowne in our estimation of Iewels and
gemmes? sometimes the Rubie, sometimes the Pearle,
aswell as the Diamond, growes in request; for these
must follow the course of the times. And therefore generally
he is reputed the wise man, not who frames and
fashions himselfe according to right reason, but he that
can square himselfe according to ye condition of those
times wherein hee liues; for things are not accounted
according to the truth and goodnesse of their nature,
neither are all things as they appeare, but as they are
esteemed among men. And herein especially consists
the regall power of man, that as it is proper to Princes,
to make their own coynes, and to proclaime them; so,
as man himselfe accounts of the creatures, or stands in
want of the creatures, thereafter they carrie their due
valuation.
            It is no marueile, if we doe so much differ in our 
goods, our substance and treasure;The beautie of different complexions. for I do much more
wonder, how it is possible, that man should so farre mistake
himselfe in his owne person, I meane concerning
his comelinesse and beautie; for I will not extend my
speech at this time, but onely to the sensible and materiall
parts of man. As for example, with vs the sanguine
and cleere complection, the soft flaxen or browne
haire, the smooth skinne, the blacke and quick eye, are
most commendable, for the comelinesse of our parts:
but it should seeme, that the greatest part of the world
is not of our iudgement; for the Aethiopians or Moores
doe not esteeme him beautifull, that hath not a blacke

and sooty skinne, a grislie hard-twisted and curld black
haire, great lips, and albugineous eye: from the Aethiopians,
if wee should visite the Indians, there it should
seeme the tawnie colour is most in request; and the
hard skinne tand with the Sunnes heate, seemes to bee
the faire and beautifull complection. And thus we cannot
agree vpon our owne colours: the same fauour is
not alike pleasing to all nations; if wee should with a
generall consent borrow our beautie from one common
boxe, then happily there would be some kinde of
agreement: but now in our naturall constitution, see
the great difference, when euery man must fansie a set
forme of beautie to himselfe, and please himselfe with
that beautie.
            Thus (I hope) it hath appeared, that whatsoeuer is
best pleasing to man, it is therefore best pleasing, because
man himselfe conceiues the greatest pleasure
therein: not because he is so naturally inclined, not because
he is moued with the truth of things, according
to their goodnesse, for so all men should be alike affected;
reason is the same in all, and euery other thing
doth naturally incline to the best; onely man hauing a
free will to make his owne choice,We must condemne nature, if we iustifie our selues. the libertie of his
choice is not guided by nature, or by reason, but by his
affection. Otherwise we should not disagree in our fauour
and comelinesse: for the Owle will not boast of
her beautie, but is ashamed of her selfe. We should not
differ or vary in our goods, or our substance, but should
iudge and esteeme all things, according to the in-bred
and naturall goodnesse: for there are degrees in the
creatures, both in themselues, and as they are fitted for
mans present vse and occasions. We should be all clothed
alike, as flowers and fruits of the same kinde, haue
alwaies the same colours: our diet and food should be
alike, as it is to all other creatures, whose nature is the

same: neither should wee so much dissent in our dwellings
and habitations; for birds in building their nests,
and beasts in making their caues, seeme to obserue the
same rules of art and proportion. And therefore wee
must either accuse nature of follie, to iustifie our selues,
or else we must truly acknowledge, that wee our selues
are not carried, according to the truth of things, but in
the strong apprehension of our owne fansie.
            But heere is all the difficultie,How hardly men are weaned from these fansies. how I should weane
man from these fansies; I could wish that in all my
dealings with men, I might meet with reasonable creatures;
for then I should know, vpon what grounds I
might deale; I might gesse how farre by all likelihood
and probabilitie I should preuaile; for wee are both
squared to one rule, the same reason would direct vs
both. But if I meete with vnreasonable men, I know
not what course to take; being once out of the rodeway,
lost in the woods, I know not where to make
search for them: and if by great chance I should ouertake
them, yet I cannot accompanie them thorough
thickets and bushes; but must reduce them againe to a
great rode, make them first capable of reason, that so I
might softly and leisurely proceede vpon my owne
grounds. To disswade the whole world from the pursuite
of these vanities, were a worke impossible; for if
I should speake with the tongue of men and Angels, I
should neuer preuaile, they are so farre besotted, inamoured,
made drunken with the immoderate loue of
the creatures. As, if their stomackes were ouerlaid with
new wine; the fumes, vapours, and spirits ascending,
would choake vp the braine, and hinder the right vse of
their vnderstanding: so is it outwardly with the creatures;
flesh &amp; bloud is wholly corrupted, ye world doth
seduce them, they behold nothing but vanitie: but to
him that shall recall himself, I would vse these motiues.
            
               First the meditation of God and his kingdome,The 
                     •
                  oue of God, swallowes vp the loue of this world.
where God himselfe sits in perfect maiesty, lucem inhabitat
inaccessibilem, gloriosus ante secula, trinus &amp; vnus,
where all the hallowes of heauen sit vpon thrones, clothed
with glory; hither send vp thy minde and thy spirit,
as Iosua sent forth his spies to discouer the promised
land; or as the Queene of Saba made a long iourney to
see the magnificence of Salomons Court. But heerein
thou canst not bee ignorant of thine owne condition,
being indeed a pilgrime heere vpon earth, in statu viae,
not in statu patriae; thou mayest well mistake thy selfe in
the meanes, though otherwise thou desirest to attaine
thine owne proper end. If it were possible for man to
behold God, and truly to know him, being indeed the
very end of mans creation, assuredly nothing should
withhould him from the loue of his maker; if the eye
could behold the sunne, we should neuer cast our eyes
from the sunne, as being the most beautifull obiect, but
this cannot stand with our weaknesse; for now God is
concealed as in the vaile of his manhood, so thou seest
not his hinder parts, but onely his shadow in the creatures.
            Secondly,The vanity of the creatures, should keepe vs from the loue of the creatures. if for want of sufficient light, being left
to thy selfe, thou still continue in darkenes; and that the
meditation of God, together with all thy blessings receiued
from God, in the whole course of thy life, with
all the promises of ioy to succeed, haue not such an attractiue
power, as that they can draw thee to God; then
consider thine owne proper misery, and all thy supposed
ioyes, and pleasures to be but meere vanities, and delusions,
such as can giue thee no true contentment or ioy.
For a Postiller brings forth this instance, (very fitly to
this purpose); A rawe bone, wherein there was neither
moysture nor sap, was cast to a hungry dog for his pray;
the dog very greedily bites and gnawes on it, and finding

the hardnesse to be such, as that it would not easily
yeeld to his teeth, yet he forsakes it not, but at length
bites his owne lip, and finding the warmth and sweetnes
of his owne bloud, therein begins to delight, and
thinkes it comes from the bone: and thus it is with all
our worldly pleasures, we esteeme them for pleasures,
the world houldes them for pleasures, men doe generally
repute them for pleasures; and I protest, heere is all
the pleasure I finde in them. Voluptates non venientes
sed abeuntes respice, bee rightly informed of thy pleasures,
doe not esteeme of them, as they come vnto thee,
in the greedines of thy minde, and thy passion: but as
they leaue and forsake thee, then remember thy pleasures,
and iudge of them accordingly; and let the meditation
heereof giue thee occasion to dislike and distaste
nature, and to hasten thy approach vnto God.
            Thirdly,Neuer man found contentment in the creatures. if neither meditation of God, nor the view
of these vanities can sufficiently instruct thee; then I
could wish, that thou hadst a glut and surfeit of thy delights,
and that triall were made, what contentment
nature could yeeld thee. Certaine it is, that if there
may be a surfeit, then the creatures are to bee taken in
moderation; and that they are not the scope of mans
happines. As (for example) suppose I were sicke, I would
desire health without limitation; health, health, and nothing
but health; but for my physicke be it neuer so soueraigne
and pretious, yet still I would take it in a certaine
dozis and measure (as it were) to be fitted for the
recouery of my health. Now certaine it is, that there
may be a surfet, for otherwise why shouldest thou delight
in the variety and succession of thy pleasures and
sports? but suppose thou hadst all possible contentment,
which nature could assoord thee; yet grow wise by experience,
iudge of thy selfe by others, runne ouer all
former examples, consider all states, callings and professions

of men, and as it is with them, so conceiue it
would bee with thy selfe. Alexander hauing gotten
the whole world, began to enquire, whether there were
any more worlds to bee conquered; for it is not this
world that can giue vs contentment: we must lay seige
to another world, heauen must suffer violence; and
therefore the spouse in the Canticles is compared to an
armie and hoste of fighting men, fighting for victory
and triumph.
            To giue thee some ease and recreation, in this my
longe tedious discourse; I will heere tell thee a tale, to
this purpose.The tale of a religious man. A certaine religious man, hauing often
disswaded some worldlings frō the immoderat loue of
the creatures, and being neuer able to preuaile; at length
bethought himselfe how he might satisfie their desires,
and resolued on this course; that if he could but giue
them a glut and surfeit of the creatures, then they
would the more easily forbeare. And calling them together,
making his complaint that hee could no more
moue them, with his earnest and continuall perswasions;
in the end 
                  •
               ould them, that now it had pleased
God, to deale so gratiously both with him and with
them, as that hee had sufficient plenty, whereby hee
might satisfie all their requests; and to this end, wished
them to ad
                  •
               ise, what one thing in this world might
giue them all contentment. Heere began a wise and a
serious consultation amongst them, what they should
aske; some desired all their portion in siluer and gould,
but others seemed to refuse that motion, for the same
coyne is not euery where current▪ and it only followes
mans valuation; they did likewise feare and suspect his
chimicall gould, which (as they had heard) was onely
counterfeit, and had not the naturall and true properties
of gould, and was not physicall, and would not endure
the touch: others therefore thought fit, to beg

silkes, wares, and houshold stuffe: but heere was a great
doubt; for if they should haue them in such plentie,
they would beare no rate, neither could they long be
continued, for the moth would consume them: a third
sort thought fit to haue cattell and beasts, but then
heere grew the mischiefe, how they should keepe them
for want of fodder and stuble: many others had their
seueral plots and their proiects, but at length all agreed,
and the fore-man of the iury in the name of the rest,
gaue in this verdit; that aboue all, lands and groundes
were to be sought, for it was the mother earth which
was the foundation, and brings forth all other commodities;
and therefore all of them did desire a competent
demaine, a large parke, sufficient medow, good arable
and pasture, and wood-land for timber and fuell; this
was the summe of their petition.
            The religious man replied,He satisfies their request. that although it were
much easier for him, to supply any other commoditie
then this, yet heerein hee would not bee wanting: but
promised vpon his honesty and credit, to giue them
their full contentment; and yet I will not (quoth hee)
remoue the land-markes of my neighbours, I will not
vniustly intrude vpon other mens possessions, I will not
tempt God to desire a new creation, or that God
would enlarge the earth, and giue it a greater circumference.
But heere is my intent, some two acres of
ground were left me by inheritance, these I purpose to
giue, and am content to part with amongst you: bring
hither your cartes, and your waynes; dig it, delue it,
carry it, all is yours, I will giue you the free and franke
possession of it. Do you answere me, that it is not worth
the digging and carriage? then assuredly you are much
mistakē in iudgement, that haue made so bad a choice,
as first to demand it. Doe you aske, me where you shall
lay it? euen where you please, in your harts, in youl

mouthes, in your purses, in your coffers, the world is
spatious and wide, fill vp the huge Ocean, and make it
champion; if you make it a bottome, there you shall
haue the rich meadow: if you raise it and make it a leuel,
here is the fruitfull corne ground: if you giue it some

                  •
               igher ascent, then you shall haue it in wood-land and
pasture. O how happy are the rich men of this world!
but wherefore doe ye thus prolong the time? bring hither
your spades, here is earth enough, heere is land enough:
if my plenty failes, let me beare the blame▪
whatsoeuer is wanting in the latitude and extension,
you shall finde it in the depth and profunditie. I pray'
dig, I pray' dig, and when ye are once gone 3500. miles
hence, (for all is mine,) then you shall come to the center
of the earth, heere you shall trie admirable conclusions
of nature, how after so great a descent, the earth
shall still be aboue you, (still be aboue you, for indeed
it is alwayes aboue you, and you are slaues to the earth)
where it shall fall of it owne accord, and so shall ease
you of a great part of your labours. Here if Archimedes
were liuing, he would apply his engines and tooles for
mouing the earth; but stay your hands, hould, hould,
let vs not vniustly incroach vpon the boundes of our
neighbours, the Antipodes; if we should contend in
suite, I feare it would proue a leading case, and I
would not willingly spend my selfe in their demurres.
But now I call to minde, we shall not need to trespasse
vpon them, when their owne bounds shall fall of themselues.
Heere thorough a hollownes of the earth, you
may with some labour creepe into another world, a
new sound and vnknowne world, happily vnpeopled
and vnhabited; but if otherwise furnisht and stockt
with people, yet like sons of the earth terrae filij, hauing
past thorough the wombe and bowels of the earth, you
may well claime your right of inheritance.
            
               Here one began to enquire of this religious man,
who should keepe them, and how they should liue in
the meane time?Our worldly appetites are satisfied in death. whereunto hee replied, that it was
prouidently spoken; and yet hee doubted not, but in
their digging they should finde out a myne of siluer or
gold, which might well pay for their labours. As yet he
neuer made triall, and therefore could say nothing to
the contrary, only in conscience he was bound to suppose
and to beleeue the best: but it should seeme, that
the concourse of people was great, for euery man came
to the marte, expecting large possessions in this franke
distribution, the time was likewise prolonged, and many
meetings were appointed, for euery man hoped,
that this man generally reputed religious, should be as
good as his word, and performe his promise. Now in
the meane time, one of them died; heere this religious
man tooke iust occasion, to shew them the vanity of
their desires: and first hee points at the breathlesse carcasse,
vncouers it; how pale and horrid it lookes! can
you behold it without fearfulnes? Where is the blood?
where is the fresh colour? the curl'd lockes, the proud
lookes, the aspiring thoughts, the soft cheeks, the cherrie
lips, the gripple hands, the greedie heart? What shal
you neede to desire such large possessions, when the
length of a few feet shall serue to containe and inclose
you? Here I will stop his mouth with earth, that he shal
not be able once to aske or to crie for more earth. Here
let vs open a pit; see how the creeping and the crawling
wormes come forth to expect their bootie: his
mouth shall be filled with earth, his bellie with earth;
all is earth, and nothing but earth. For it is the property
of true loue, to vnite and couple together: His loue
to the earth, shall conuert his whole body to earth.
Heere let vs burie him, and heere is the end of all your
vaine hopes; onely our comfort is, that hee is gone to

another world. where wee shall follow him; there hee
doth now rest from his labours; and here we must only
labour for that rest; and so my tale is ended.
            Now recalling my selfe,The Authors intent in this second part. I will draw to a conclusion:
my intent in this second part of my Treatise was; first,
to open mans miseries to himselfe, that seeing his condition,
he might flie to his maker, to change or relieue
his condition. For certainly, as the state now stands,
creatures are onely subiect to sorrow; no creature so
wretched as man; no man so miserable, as is the Christian
man with his fastings, repentance, and passions,
were it not for the hope of his happinesse. Secondly, lest
man might flatter himselfe and be deluded, with a fond
conceited opinion of his owne ioyes, I discouered all
our worldly pleasures to be but fansies; that hauing no
true ground of happinesse in our selues, wee might cast
vp our anchor of hope vnto heauen, and so stay our
selues from falling; expecting Iacobs ladder, and Angels
descending and ascending, that Christ being once
exalted in power, might draw all vnto himselfe. Heere
was the scope of my intent; for I did obserue the
strange actiuity of mans soule, which could not be contained
within it selfe, but must bee necessarily diffused;
if not to the Creator, then to the creature. And I did
perswade my selfe, that if I could but sufficiently repaire
the bankes, and hinder the violent intrusion of
waters; that then the riuer would keepe it owne channell,
and runne to the Ocean: for thus man is onely directed
to God. And therefore (as at all times) we ought
to detest the immoderate and excessiue loue, or abuse
of the creatures; so somtimes wee should forbeare the
tolerable and lawfull vse. Though God may bee worshipped
in them; yet lest they should steale our selues
from our selues, and cast a mist vpon our sacrifice (the
frailty of our nature being so easily led and carried away

with the outward allurements of the world, and
with the inward strong temptations of the flesh); lest
being associates, they might bereaue God of his honour;
and though in themselues they are meanes to
stirre vp loue and thankfulnesse to God; yet through
our abuse, they might bee an occasion of our fall: and
therefore it were to bee wished, that they might not
come nearer within the compasse of our sacrifice, then
is befitting the naturall ceremonies, to set forth the honour
and dignitie of the seruice.
            This shall appeare by the counsell of God himselfe,
though otherwise he allowes, and approues the honest
callings and professions of men;How apt the creatures are to obscure Gods glory. yet he appointed a day,
free from all worldly labours, to the memorie and seruice
of himselfe. So for the place of his worship, he appointed
a Temple, separated from all worldly imployments:
to make it a house of Merchandize (though
Merchandize be an honest calling) were to make it a
denne of theeues; to exchange money there, though
otherwise it be for the vse of the Temple, were to rob
God of his honour. Yet this was not in sancto sanctorum;
in the holiest of holies, where no man had accesse
but onely the high Priest, and that but once in the yere:
this was not in the Temple, but in atrio templi, in the
court of the Temple. As much in effect, as if I should
say; to sell things in the Church-yard, which are for
the vse of the Temple, were a great prophanation of
the Temple. So God requires the whole and entire
heart, and no part thereof must be left for the creature:
primogenitum, the first begotten must be consecrated
to God; and the heart of man is the first begotten in
man. The practice of the Church, doth follow the counsell
of God: in our prayers we are called vpon, sursum
corda, to lift vp our hearts. Notwithstanding that God
is euery where, yet for feare of annoyance, which might

redound vnto vs from the creatures, wee are admonished
to worship God aboue the sphere of the creatures:
our Church men and Priests, as being a whole
burnt offering, consecrated to God, are separated from
the secular condition of men. And in confessing our
sinnes, lest there should be some kind of delight, in the
remembrance of some sinne, we are therefore enioyned
a silence; though otherwise confession seemes to bee
necessarie to repentance.
            To conclude, the truth of our misery shall speak and
discouer it selfe, with our cries,How all our ioyes are counterfeit. our grones, and complaints;
and the vanity of al our worldly pleasures herein
appeares; when wee purpose to bee most merrie and
iouiall, then must wee lay aside our owne persons, and
grauity; we must alter and change our owne shapes, to
make our selues capable of pleasures and delights. Wee
vse masking, mumming, enterludes, Playes, some
strange and anticke daunces; all which I commend, as
being honest, harmelesse, and lawfull sports; though
otherwise it may appeare, that vsing these shewes, wee
haue but the shewe of true ioy, and are very miserable
and wretched in our selues; that are inforced thus to
transforme our selues, to find out some pleasures. Againe,
suppose that a mans whole life were spent in a
continued shewe: suppose, that man wanted neither
foode, nor raiment, and perswaded himselfe, that hee
were none of the ordinary sort of men, none of the
common ranke and condition; but some great honourable
Peere; some grand-child, descended from the
great Oneale; that Princes, and Ladies haue died with
their modesty for loue of him; that all men doe either
admire, or enuie his vertues; that with his wisedome
he is able to settle and establish the gouernment of
kingdomes. I would gladly know, what difference
there were betweene this counterfeit, and a true Peere?

All honour consists onely in reputation and esteeme,
and hath little ground-worke in nature; the one is as
confident of his honour, as the other, and both alike
are perswaded: animus cuiusque est quisque, it is the
mind, which (according to her owne apprehension)
giues al the contentment. Now where is the difference?
There is as much (I confesse) as there is betweene errour
and truth; but all consists in the imagination; and
were there not some difficultie in a man, thus to perswade,
and to flatter himselfe, it were an excellent kind
of delusion.
            Thus truly acknowledging our miseries, we are likewise
enforced to confesse the rewards of our sinne,Why all our delights should consist in the fansie. and
the fruits of Gods iustice: yet calling to mind the mercies
of God, which ouerflow all his workes: miserationes
domini super omnia opera eius: in this our wauering
and slipperie state, being fallen into the depth of
sinne, wee erect and lift vp a pillar of faith and hope,
which laying hold and apprehending the mercies of
God, doth assure our owne soules, that there is a better
world to succeed: where true happinesse, and a crowne
of glory is reserued for Gods Saints. And therefore these
worldly pleasures being but shadowes, and all our delight
consisting onely in the fansie, should not withhold
vs in the pursuite of that true happinesse. Herein I
doe magnifie and acknowledge the goodnes and prouidence
of God; that as man in his condition is rather
spirituall, then carnall; for his minde (according to
right reason) should gouerne his flesh: and as the last
end of man, the happinesse whereunto man is ordained,
and directed, is wholly spirituall; as is the knowledge,
the loue, and the vniting with the Godhead: so,
lest man should proue too much a slaue to his sense, and
his carcasse; it hath pleased God still to permit, that all
mans delights and pleasures should reside in the fansie,

which is but onely a shadow of our true vnderstanding,
rather then any earthly ioy or contentment
should truly and really possesse vs.
            And that you might not conceiue, that this is my priuate
opinion; I will therfore (in one word) take a view,
what the Gentiles, the Iewes, and the Christians, haue
thought of this truth; and what effects the meditation
here of hath wrought vpon thē. You shall then obserue,
yt the consideration of mans present state &amp; condition,
moued the ancient Heathen Philosophers to take
whole nature, and to set it in a limbecke, so to distill it;
wherein they found by the force of fire, the vnresistable
power of reason; that all nature did either euaporate
to a fume, or a smoake, which indeed is the vanity
of the creatures; or else did settle downe, as the grosse
and earthly part in the bottome; and this is the misery
of the creatures: &amp; from hence proceeded two seuerall
sects of Philosophers, of different and contrary dispositions;
the one laughing at the vanity,Democritus, and Heraclitus. the other weeping
at the miserie; and both of them esteemed very
wise in their owne generation.
            But when the naturall light of reason is left to it
selfe, it is but a kinde of darkenesse; for nature is partiall
to her selfe, and out of her owne loue, to her selfe,
cannot wholly condemne herselfe. I will therefore
come to the Iewes, whose eyes were better enlightened
with Gods Law, though they had but shadowes of
mysteries, and only types and figures of a true sacrifice,
yet were they sufficiently instructed how to condemne
nature: and they proceeded further then the Heathen
Philosophers; drawing nature to a greater height, and
making some better extraction; and therefore they
doe not content themselues with vanities; but they acknowledge
that there is a vanity of vanities,
                  Salomons censure of this world. when
man doth please himselfe with his owne vanities. So

likewise there is not only misery, &amp; vexation, but vexation
of spirit, when man considers that these miseries
heere vpon earth, are the fore-runners of Gods heauie
iudgements to come; and therfore Salomon, their great,
wise, and potent King concludes; I viewed mine owne
workes, to take some contentment in mine owne actions,
yet I found none, but all was vanity of vanities, and vexation
of mind.
            
            I am a Christian man, and therein I doe humbly, hartily,
and daily thanke God, who (of his mercy) hath called
me to this state of saluation. And heere I doe constantly
affirme,The conclusion of a Christian man. that there is no ioy or comfort to man,
vnlesse it be to the Christian man; whose God appeared
in basenesse and misery. And therefore for example
and imitatton of that miserable God, (being all parts
and members vnder such a mysticall head,) that there
might be a conformity between the head, &amp; the members
(ne sit membrum delicatum sub capite spinoso) hee
desires the like miseries, and would willingly and readily
imbrace the same passions; as being the holy reliques
of his God; and in the course of his miserie, acknowledgeth
a diuine prouidence, Gods holy hand,
correction and permission. He is well assured, that hee
is the miserable man, who offers wrong and iniustice
to his innocent brother; who hath iust cause to reioyce,
if he suffers the greatest misery vndeseruedly: and considering
that all miseries are tending, and ending in
death; desiring death as a passage or gate to a better
life, cupio dissolui &amp; esse cum Christo, hee will bee thus
faithfully resolued; non sunt passiones huius vitae condignae
ad futuram gloriam, &amp;c. The miseries and
passions of this life are not to bee respected, in
regard of that crown of glory, which God
hath prepared for his Saints.
            Deo gratias.
         
         
            
            THE FALL
OF MAN.
            THE THIRD PART.
            
               OVt of the deepe haue I cried vnto
thee O Lord, Lord heare my
voyce; one deepe cals vp an other,
the depth of my sinne,A Prayer. cals
for the depth of thy goodnes; the
depth of my misery, cals for the
depth of thy mercy: in stead of
all my worldly vanities, giue
me (O Lord) the sweet comfort
of thy spirit, and the solid foundation of thy ioy, guide me
in these my darke and slippery wayes, by the assistance of
thy power. Open my lips, and my mouth shall speake forth
thy praise, kindle my heart, that I may enlighten and enflame
others; conuert and confirme me, that I may strengthen
my brethren: forsake me not O Lord in mine old age
when I am gray-headed, vntill I haue shewed forth thy
glory and praise to succeeding generations; heare me O
Lord, for thou art my God and my sauiour in whom I doe
trust, thou art the strength and horne of my saluation.
            If there were no other argument, to perswade me of
the naturall corruption of man, but onely the implicite
and secret confession of man himselfe, concerning himselfe,

together with the daily practice of his actions,Man is vic
                     ••
                  is and corrupted in euery state and course of life.
this were sufficient. For in what course or condition of
life would you suppose man, wherein you should not
finde an euident proofe of his corruption? If man be solitarie
and alone; then you shall finde him melancholy,
discontented, and in some dislike with himselfe, as it
were (for want of others) picking quarrels, and fighting
with himselfe? now place him in the company and society
of others, and presently hee falles to banding and
factions. Wherefore serues such a number of fencing-schooles,
or the nature of combates and duels, now at
length reduced to the rules and forme of an Art? and
such as will not aduenture their bloud in a quarrell,
they must contend in suites of law, to the impairlng of
their substance. Histories are daily written, which discouer
the subtilties and trickes of state; but sure it is,
that there is as much false dealing, close practises, cunning
suggestions, dissimulation, breach of promises,
and euery way as much dishonesty in a petty, poore,
base, paultry Corporatiō, for the choice of their towne-Clearke,
their Bailiffe, or some such officer, as you
shall finde among the great Bashawes for the vpholding
and supporting of the Turkish Empire. The whole
world is distracted with factions, and therefore surely
the ould time was much to be commended, in tolerating,
or rather giuing occasion to some countrey may-games
and sportes, as dancing, piping, pageants, all
which did serue to asswage the cruelty of mans nature;
that giuing him some little ease and recreation, they
might with-hould him from worser attempts, and so
preserue amitie betweene men. Vpon the abolishing of
these, you could not conceiue in reason, were it not that
we finde it true by experience, (for sometimes things
which are small in the consideration, are great in the
practise) what dissolute and riotous courses? what vnlawfull

games? what drunkennes? what enuy, hatred,
malice, and quarelling haue succeeded in lieue of these
harmlesse sports? and these are the fruits, which our
strict professors haue brought into the world; I know
not how they may boast of their faith (for indeed they
are pure professors) but sure I am, they haue banisht all
charity.
            In our dealings and contracts with men, sometimes
we blame the complections and lookes of others, solemnly
protesting that we dislike their visage, and will
admit no dealings with them;Hovv vve accuse each other. sometimes wee dislike
their names, sometimes the whole kindred, the stocke,
and the familie; sometimes the whole nation is condemned.
Whereas all this time we are much mistaken
and deceiued, for either the hate and dislike should be
extended, and generally comprehend whole nature,
whole mankinde, for God sawe all the counsels of men,
that they were full of impietie and wickednesse; or else
we should contract our hate, and begin first and principally
to hate our selues, as consisting equally with them
of the same corruption. But behold, for our selues wee
haue found out some lurking holes, some retiring places,
some speciall priuiledge and indulgence proper to
vs: if all other goodly and godly pretenses doe faile,
then we can boast of our ancestors, that we are descended
from honest &amp; noble parents. Which (certainly) we
would neuer doe, were it not, (that implicitly) we confesse
the basenesse and vilenesse of our owne nature in
generall, and therefore we seeke to couer and conceale
our owne shame in particular. Heere we vse scutchions
and armes, beasts forsooth must discouer our conditions
and qualities, they must shew our parentage; whereas
indeed the Prophet hath better described it, radix tua,
&amp; generatio tua ex terra Canaan, pater tuus Amoreus,
mater tua Cethea, tu
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   ex corrupto semine: thy father

was an Amorite, thy mother was a Cethit, and thou art
borne and conceiued in sinne, all thy other coates are
but counterfeit, sometimes bought with a price; let thy
armory consist of a Lyon and of a Lambe: the Lyon of
the tribe of Iuda, to enable thee with fortitude and courage;
and let the lambe of God teach thee true humility
and meekenesse.
            Now in our actions, consider the enuie and malignitie
of our nature; how apt we are to offend each other,
and being once prouoked,Man out of his euill disposition, returneth euill for euill. how readily we returne euil
for euill? how irreconcileable is our hate, we crie for
nothing but reuenge? to preach of mercy and forgiuenes,
durus hic sermo, this seemes to bee a hard saying,
though indeed it should soften our hard hearts; habet
&amp; musca splenem, the meanest and basest vassall will
meditate and thinke of reuenge, if he sustaines the least
supposed wrong from his master and Lord. It should
seem
                  •
               , that our nature being wholly inclind vnto euill,
we cannot forbeare to doe euill, and in the suffering of
euill, we must needs repay euill, according to the similitude
and likenesse of our nature, when both action and
passion are performed by one and the same qualitie: for
heate working vpon heate, the greater will allure and
draw forth the lesse; and it is onely christian religion,
which takes away the corruption of our nature, and
giues vs this precept, to ouercome an other mans euill
with our own good. But you will say, that common iustice
requires (as much in effect) to returne euil for euil,
that the reward might be agreeable to the desert: heerin
consists your error, that you suppose iustice, which is
a commendable vertue, that it can reside betweene vices
There is a proportion I confesse, but an euil proportion,
in things that are wholy euill; iustice would rather
square out malum culpae, to malum poenae, the euill of
punishment to the euill of transgression, but sinne to be

recompensed with sin, heere is no iustice; I will therefore
make a s
                  •
               cond instance, which shall be beyond all
exception.
            It is proper to the corrupt nature of man, to turne all
the best qualities into the worst part,Man out of his
euill disposition, tu
                     •
                  neth good things into 
                     •
                  uill. like a spider that
turnes the best substance into poyson, as if an Alchimist
should breake his owne glasses, waste his oyle, and lay
vp onely the drosse. Thus great learning tends to confusion,
the best courage is tainted with rashnesse; but in
our actions betweene men, suppose wee receiue great
benefits from our benefactors, such as cannot easily be
recompensed, certainly nothing is so proper to man,
nothing so commendable in man as thankfulnes: for
nature prescribes it in euery creature, the earth according
to thy labour shall yeeld thee a crop, heere is her
thankfulnes; the beasts according to thy keeping shall
bring thee a profit, heere is their thankfulnes. God
likewise commands it, and seemes to be principally ingaged
in our thankfulnes, for it is God that hath giuen
vs all ours, our selues, and more then our selues, the
meanes of our redemption (the sonne of God incarnat)
is more then our selues, our expected happines is more
then our present possession. Thus man though finite in
himselfe, yet is infinitly indebted to God, &amp; is to be tied
to his thankfulnes accordingly; but God as by himself,
so likewise by others imparts these his blessings. Now
for our thankfulnes and recompence, will ye heare the
course of the world? O the cursed and corrupted course
of this world! we must not be indebted for such kindnesse,
which cannot easily bee recompensed; and therefore
our manner is, not onely to suppresse them, to forget
or deny them, but to reward them with all reproch
and dishonor, as desiring to free our selues, from the
bondage and captiuity of thankfulnes, whereby wee
stand obliged to others.
            
               The best actions of man, doe they not argue the corruption
of man?Our good actions proceed from an euill intent. I will not descend to that question in
Theology, whether the morall vertues of the heathen,
were not splendida peccata, varnisht and glorious sins;
but among vs Christians, do not many religious and
charitable workes proceed from vaine glory? Somtimes
the good and pre
                  •
               erment which we intend to an other,
proceeds not from our loue towards him, but in the
course of our faction, out of the hate and enmity which
we beare to our aduersaries, well hoping that his aduancement
may serue to abate their pride. Thus the
condition of man being wholly sinfull and corrupted,
we seeke to preuent sinne with sinne; we can be content
to doe ill offices to our superiours, to set them at iar and
contention, thereby to secure our selues and to purchase
our owne peace. And thus the corrupted dealings
of men seeme in some sort, best to agree with their
corrupted nature: seldome or neuer shall you finde any
action, which doth n
                  •
               t faile, either in substance or circumstance;
and where there is the least spice of euill,
there the whole action is euill; a little soure and corrupted
leauen seasons the whole masse. For as it is in our
vnderstanding, the conclusion of syllogismes must alwayes
follow the worser part, so is it in our morall actions,
the least euill changeth the whole nature of the
action; and this proceeds from the strong inclination of
our nature vnto euill.
            If it lies not in our power to returne euill for euill,We delight in other mens euils. or
to recompense good with euill, or to doe good with an
euill intent, yet are we still delighted with euill, wee reioyce
to see the hard chances and mis-fortunes of others.
O what a pleasant thing it is, to stand on the sea

with euill, out of the sympathy of our nature inclining
to euill: little ioy shall ye finde, vpon relation of other
mens good, but sometimes great triumphes in the
downe-fall of others.
            Whereas a feeling of one and the same greife, should
teach vs compassion to others, and the right knowledge
of our selues: it fals out far otherwise, our ioyes we desire

our sorrowes and griefe it is our greatest comfort to
haue companions, solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris:
the sicke man when hee can be no otherwise eased, yet
if an other shall complaine of the same greife, heere is
his comfort. An other mans griefe doth not ease the
griefe of his body, but thorough the euill and corruption
of his owne minde in the torments of others, he
fansies to himselfe a kind of ease and contentment, not
looking to the distemper of his owne body, and senses,

one thing is intended, an other pretended; what glorious
shewes of piety? what colour of religion, freedome
of conscience, the liberty of the subiect, the good
of the commons, the profit of the state, the reformation
of abuses and grieuances? verba audio, wee are weary

so thred-bare, common &amp; triuial, that the poore tradesmen
can discourse of them. Thus certainly being inwardly
corrupted, therein we discouer our nature, and
making some faire outward glosse, we seeme implicitly
to acknowledge the corruption; though otherwise like
bould liers, we desire to varnish and paint ouer our rottennesse.
            But policy is a Secret of state, which must be hidden
and concealed like a mystery; the rules must not bee diuulged,
least they giue way to the practise; the actions
cannot be iustified, non laudantur nisi peracta, they will
not dispute of them, but being once performed, then
they will finde out some probable colour to excuse the
offence: they will drop downe their fauours, that so distilling
their gifts, the memory of their former cruelty
may be abolisht, vntil they finde some fit oportunity for
a second massacre. Let vs leaue the policies of men, the
extent whereof I will leaue to Gods permission and prouidence,
and to their owne consciences. Doe not the
lawes of men, made by the whole body of the kingdome,
wherein euery man seemes to haue his voice and
free suffrage, do they not suppose mans nature, to bee
wholly corrupted? wherefore should they preuent
murther, treason, thef

penall lawes,The Lawes of men suppose our naturall corruption. so many prouisoes? were it not, that
mans nature is generally esteemed to be wholy corrupted;
and that men might well be suspected for heathen,

paganes, and infidels, who would attempt sins against
God, against nature, against the state, and therefore
there must be a punishment for euery offence; and in
enacting our statutes, are not the law makers inforced
to vse their best wits, all their cunning and skill, with
multitudes of words, and long repetitions, least the crochets
of mans braine being apt to cauill, should finde
out some starting holes?
            I forget my selfe, I forget my selfe, for, speaking of
mans corruption, I am so far entangled, that I cannot
easily release my selfe;The scope of

things seeme to sound corruption. But recalling my
selfe, I cannot forget that I haue allotted this third part,
to treat onely of those punishments, which are generally
related in Scripture, to be the punishments of the first
sinne; neither can I speake of all the punishments, for so
I should vndertake an infinit taske. I must therefore tye
my selfe to a certaine number, and considering that the
state of this life is a sinfull state, I will resemble it to the
state of the Israe

               tes in Aegypt, where they were borne
in slauery, and could not be deliuered but by their passage
thorough the red sea: which is a figure either of
our baptisme by water, or of our baptisme by bloud;
either of our entrance to grace, or of our entrance to
glory. Now answerable to the plagues of Aegypt, I will
proportion the number of our punishments; ten plagues
of Aegypt, according to the breach of Gods ten Commandements;
this number of ten being the most perfect
number obserued in our punishments, shall sufficiently
argue the perfection of Gods iustice, and our imperfection
in sinne.
            And first for the Serpent, which was the first cause of
our sinne,The Serpent. and therefore was first accursed of God; consider
how the serpent onely, and the serpentine kinde

feed more immediatly vpon the earth, and lie groueling
on the bellie: which certainly would much detract from
the beauty and perfection of nature, were it not that a
iudgement and a sentence past, super pectus gradieris,
terram comedes, seemes to excuse the basenesse of the
serpent, in respect of the worlds perfection; see how the
antipathi

head, and the other bites at the heele; and thus betweene
mortall creatures, there is an immortall enmity.
            But I must not thus run ouer the punishments; I will
therefore desire you to obserue in the serpent: first, her
basenesse in her selfe: secondly, the enmity towards
man, super pectus gradieris.
               The punishment of the Serpent. Gen. 3. 14. Then the Lord
God said to the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou

the meanest and basest parts, feete to support this
body? Especially cōsidering that in three extraordinary
priuiledges, aboue all other beasts of the field, she may
best glory in the indulgency of nature. 1. A great subtilty

coate, while other creatures with their wrinckled skins
carry their scars to the graue, and neuer haue change
of their rayments. Hath nature repented her selfe, and
doth she now begin to repine at these blessings? and for
the vpshot, leaues it vnfinisht, or dismembers and
cuts of the feete? can it consist of foure elements, and
yet three of them should carry no proportion, but all
the whole body should lie on the earth? Or if the brest

be the noblest part, in regard of the residencie of the
heart, must it needes sustaine the burthen and poyse of
the whole
                  •
               body? and can no other part be assigned for
that office?
            It is a maine difference betweene the sensitiue, and
the vegetatiue creatures, that trees haue their mouthes
or their stomach fastened in the earth,The Serpent creepes on the earth. but sensitiue
creatures, if they haue sight, fit it is, that their watchtower
should be erected aloft, to view and behould
their owne wayes, to order their steps, then why is it
not thus in the serpent; shall I tell you the reason? It
stood with the iustice of God, in the forme, figure, and
shape of this serpent, to intimate first the enmity to
man; that as man alone aboue all other creatures hath
an vpright figure, and lookes vp to heauen: so the serpent
alone of all other creatures, lies creeping and
groueling on the earth. 2. This serpent hath bin the
instrument of Satan, and therefore obserue still the conformity;
hell is supposed to be in the heart of the earth,
and the serpent lies with her heart to the earth. 3. The
state of the earth procured by the serpent; the earth is
round, somewhat in the forme of an egg: if it produce
euill, assure your selfe that the serpent hath hatched it,
&amp; is the sole nurse of the brood. Higher then the earth,
to the state of Angels and Saints, the poyson of this
serpent cannot ascend, for it lies and incompasseth the
earth; the serpent is already cast downe, downe to the
earth, heere she is permitted to inhabit, and to bite at
the heele, but her principall strength is abated; and at
length, as she hath no feete to support her, so she may
be easily vanquisht and cast into darknesse, where notwithstanding
her gliding and slippery condition, she
shall be tied vp in chaines, &amp;c.
            From the basenesse of her person, let vs come to the
basenesse of her food: is it possible that any creature of

such wisdome and prudency,Her

                     •

                     •
                  ng on the earth. should search for the most
noble things to hurt and annoy them, and yet should
make choice of the meanest and basest, for her owne
foode and sustenance? This is an excellent embleme of
enuie, and worthily describes the malicious accuser of
his brethren: but what a league of friendship and amitie
hath past betweene the earth and the serpent; how
deerely and tenderly doth the serpent loue and embrace
the earth, she layes her breast to the earth, feedes
on the earth, layes vp the earth in her bowels, inhabits
the earth, that so she might binde her selfe to the earth,
and the earth might wholy possesse her. And thus it befals
men of the serpentine kinde, or rather seduced by
the serpent, their mouth is full of earth, they talke of nothing
but lands, goods, purchases, demeanes, possessions,
inheritances, leases; of bonds, contracts, bargaines,
sales, commodities, marchandises, wares, &amp;c. now the
mouth speaketh out of the abundance of the heart, their
heart is full of earth and earthly cogitations, their
nayles and their hands are full of earth, their hands are
griple and holde fast, and are not so easilie, either opened
in charitie, or lifted vp in pietie, and thus is the punishment
euery way accomplished.
            Here I would desire you to obserue, that as the
dumbe creatures, are only (in the nature of instruments)
ordained and directed for the vse and seruice of man:How the dumbe creatures are punished. so
vndoubtedly, it might well stand with the iustice of
God to punish them in the nature of instruments. For
alas, what is the whole world, or the perfection of all
the creatures in respect of Gods glory, and the manifestation
of his iustice? neither was this world intended
for dumbe beasts, but onely for man; and therefore as
their slaughter is ordained for man, so if their punishment
might serue for mans admonition, and bee a remembrancer
of his sinne, this were sufficient for the exercise

of Gods iustice, and to excuse his works of imperfection.
The punishment of the serpent, may likewise
serue to instruct vs, that as the glory and beautie
of the creatures sets forth the absolute happinesse, together
with the commendation and praise of their maker:
so the basenesse and vilenesse of the creature might
betoken his wretched state and condition, who was
the first cause and occasion of sinne; assuring vs of Gods
iustice, that if he did not spare the dumbe instruments,
much lesse would hee pardon the first agents. Now to
square and to proportion these one to another, the punishment
of the serpent, to the punishment of the euill
spirit, I will forbeare to doe it at this time, in regard
that it exceeds the bounds of our naturall reason; hereafter
I may take some fitter occasion to discouer it, and
in the meane time I leaue it to euery mans priuate meditation.
            
                Least man should thinke, that the condition of the
serpent did not any way concerne him (as indeede it
doth,The enmitie betweene Man and the Serpent. being that the whole world is onely ordained for
man) I will therefore come to the second punishment,
which more immediatly concernes him, and may serue
for a caution: Insidiabitur calcaneo, Gen. 3. 15. I will
also put enmitie betweene thee and the woman, and betweene
thy seede and her seede, he shall breake thine head,
and thou shalt bruse his heel. The principall enmitie
consists betweene man and the diuell, who is therefore
fitly said to bite at his heele; as chiefely assaulting man
in the last clause of his age, in the agonie of death, and
principally intending to detaine him from the finall
vpshot and conclusion of his happinesse. In permitting
this enmitie, did appeare the fruite of Gods iustice,
as setting his owne enemies at enmitie among themselues;
and likewise the fruite of Gods mercy, that
man being thus molested and maligned by Sathan,

and the rather for Gods cause, man bearing the image
of God, and Sathan Gods pro
                  •
               est enimie, being not
able to obscure or eclipse Gods glorie, seekes to vndermine
and supplant Gods image. Hereby it falls out, that
man is now become an associate, of the same league
and amitie with God, and therefore God is now tied
for mans protection, and may at length without any
breach of law or iustice, fight in mans quarrell, against
the powers of darkenesse, the gates of hell, the kingdome
of sinne, Sathan, and damnation.
            As was the conspiracie betweene man and the serpent
for the breach of Gods law,A generall opposition betweene reason and sense. so was the combination
betweene the flesh and the spirit, both guiltie of
high treason; and therefore it stoode with the same rule
of iustice, to set an enmitie betweene reason and sense,
and betweene the reasonable and the sensitiue creatures.
First in man himselfe, in the very parts of man, a
rebellion of his members, here is an ill example and
president for all the rest of the creatures to follow; for
behold, the dumbe creatures, who were made onely for
mans vse and seruice, cast off their yoake, and are now
become dangerous and obnoxious to man, from the
greatest to the least. Wee stand not onely in feare of
fierce Lions, cruell Tigers, rauening Wolues, deuouring
Beares, but G
                  •
               ats, Flies, and the least wormes doe serue
to molest vs: let not the plagues of Aegypt seeme so incredible,
when as within our memorie, in the yeere
1580. at Southminster in Essex, the Mice so swarmed
and abounded, that their corne was spoyled, their houses
annoyed their grasse taynted, and the place made almost
inhabitable; vntill God in his mercy sent thither
great numbers and multitudes of Owles, which were
neuer seene there either before or since, and these deuoured
and did eate vp their Mice, and the Mice 
                  •
               ayling,
they tooke againe their flight, and so the plague

ceased. Now it cannot be, that the gouernment of man
ouer the creatures should so farre bee impeached, were
it not, that there is some conniuencie and toleration
from aboue, contrarie to the first institution of nature:
neither could equitie tolerate in them so foule an abuse,
if man still retayned in them the same right of inheritance,
and might pleade his title thereunto without
forfeiture, impeachment or waste.
            It is not sufficient, that man should be subiect to the
danger of creatures in generall, for his life, his limmes,
and his substance; but some there are which seeme to
mocke and to scoffe man, the Parat for his speech, the
Ape for his actions, and others for his gesture. Some
though they are impotent and cannot hurt, yet seeme
to threaten man; for there are certaine ominous creatures
in their owne kinde, which without any spice of
superstition or vaine feare,Ominous creatures. doe prognosticate euill: Others
though familiar to man, yet with some extraordinarie
and vnnaturall act, seeme to portend euill. Many
will condemne me of sollie in this kinde, but I am very
confident herein: for whereas in nature wee confesse a
pr
                  •
               uidence in euery the least naturall action, otherwise
it would disparage the gouernment of this vniuerse:
and Christian religion affirmes, that the Sparrowes
of the ayre fall downe by Gods appoyntment
and ordinance; so sometimes, for a further terrifying
and certifying of the sense, as likewise for the assuring
and example of others, God vseth outward and more
manifest signes and tokens. And as the dumbe creatures
are the instruments of Gods iustice, which did
well appeare in the plagues of Aegypt: so sometimes
they are the Prophets and denouncers of iudgements,
as in Balams asse, &amp;c. thoug
                  •
                it cannot bee denied, but
many such accidents doe arise from naturall causes; the
Rauens feeding on carcasses, no maruell if their sent doe

direct them, and that a smell inclining to death doe allure
them, and prouoke them to crie.
            But I will onely insist in the Serpent; for the enmitie
seemes greatest betweene the most noble and basest
creatures, Man and the Serpent,The Serpent assaulting Man. and that for the continuall
remembrance of the first tentation. Howsoeuer
I doubt not, but that it better appeares in those easterne
countries, wherein Paradise was first planted, and
wherein the kindes of Serpents doe much differ from
ours, yet I will now speake according to our Climate
and Meridian. Behold, when in the pleasant moneth of
May, thou desirest to take the fresh ayre, and to delight
thy senses with the odoriferous breath of sweete flowers;
when the beautie of the Lilies, and the pleasant varietie
of colours shall allure thy sight, as thou walkest
securely by the way side; or when thou dost solace thy
selfe in the groue or the shade, and there crownest thy
selfe with the garlands of nature; see see a stratagem,
a stratagem! treason, treason against thine owne person,
the base Serpent, which neuer durst once appeare in thy
sight to encounter thee, now begins to trace out thy
pathes, and to bite at thy heeles, (a part which thou
least suspectedst), where thy hands cannot stoope down
to helpe thee, yet therein the strength and poyse of thy
whole body consists; if thou touchest or treadest, thou
defilest thine owne flesh. And thus is euery man now
become Iacob, before hee can be Israel, first his thighbone
must be broken, to acknowledge his owne weaknesse,
before he can partake of the blessing.
            Wilt thou set vpon this Serpent, and by opposing
her, seeke to defend thy selfe? thou shalt finde it a very
dangerous and difficult combate; for see the guile and

               rue me, I could proportion

serpent to be his agent and instrument against man; but
I will leaue this to euery mans priuate meditation: as
likewise on the contrary,The brazon Serpent. (wherin our comfort consists)
that this serpent lu

and innocent bloud, which shall issue foorth from the
seed of the woman: then behold! byting at the frailtie of
our flesh, she shall bee insnared with the hooke of the
God-head; when both God-head and man-hood shall
be linckt together by an inseparable vnion in the person
of Christ, who is that brazen serpent prefigured out
to the Iewes. A serpent appearing in the true shape and
condition of sinfull man, and yet a brazen serpent
without sting, without poyson, reserued for continuance
and perpetuitie; the looking and beholding wherof,
being once raised vp in the wildernesse (faith apprehending
Christ crucified) shall cure all those, which
haue bin stung by the serpent.
            Thus you see the great encounter betweene man
and the creatures, the strange antipathie and discord
betweene both. Now let vs examine how the earth and
the elements stand affected to man in this great diffention,
and to what party they incline: not to speake of
the burning and consuming fire, the boysterous and vnresistable
winde or ayre, the roaring &amp; ouer-whelming
seas, or the earth, which seemes to be the foundation of
the rest, to support this reeling world, yet sometimes is
strangely moued &amp; toffed, whole cities are swallowed,
great foundations shaken, nothing vntouched; the
fruites, the hearbes, and the flowers are tainted, as if
hell (which consists in the bosome of the earth) sent
forth a flash of brimstone to infect this world; I will
passe ouer all these great generall iudgements, but (me
thinkes) in my passage I am detaind, incompassed, and
apprehended by thornes, that I cannot winde my selfe

would much detract from the diuine wisdome
and goodnesse, were it not that they are rooted in that
earth, that earth which is accursed for sin, and therefore
brings forth bryars and brambles, as tortures and torments
for the iust punishment of sinne.
            The earth was first created of nothing▪ and as the
earth was nothing in her production, so if God had left
the earth to it selfe it should haue produced nothing;Their production.

should haue bin like the fruitlesse sands, or the barren
rockes, as not apt for graine, so not plentifull of weedes
or of thistles; nothing should haue bin the fruite of that,
which is nothing in it selfe▪ and was nothing in his first
production. But whence I pray', proceed the thistles &amp;
thornes, the weedes and the briars? where is that blessing,
that euery thing should multiply and increase according
to his owne kinde? was this blessing equally
imparted to all, or else where is the kinde, where is the
seede, that it should thus exceedingly ingender of it
selfe? Take the rich meadow, the fruitful corne-ground,
the wood-land, the pasture, the clay, the chalke, or the
sand, all serue alike for the briars and thornes, the difference
of mould or complection, hinders not their production.

No maruaile, when the woodes meete to
chuse them a King, that they easily agree in their choise,
for the briar and thorne seeme to haue vanquished the
whole earth, and therefore may well claime the gouernment
&amp; rule by right of their conquest: But wherfore
serues seede to ingender and multiply, if things
without seed increase more abundantly? nature should
saue her selfe that labour, whereas her longest time, and
greatest worke-manship, appeares in producing the
seed.
            Is it not sufficient to produce them in such a plentifull
manner, but for their saftie and protection, to indue
them with prickes and thornes? insomuch that their
very names are deriued from their offensiue weapons,Nature seemes to be more carefull of thornes, then of the best fruits.
as if they stood vpon their guard, and were at open defiance
with man, offering violence to his person, laying
hould on his garments, as it were apprehending him,
and arresting him of high treason, pearcing his flesh, desiring
to be bewatered and moystned with mans bloud,
as it were torturing him, to wring out some confession;
or seasing on man as a prey, intending to fasten the
roote, or at least threatning to doe it in the dissolution
of his body: or do these thornes serue in defence of the
earth? that man should not presume to touch the earth,
as being without the compasse of his ancient inheritance,
first placed in the garden, he hath no right to the
chase or the wildernesse; being first made Lord of the
creatures, he should not now descend to be a hedger or
ditcher. I cannot perswade my selfe, that these thornes
serue only for defense of themselues, seeing thei
                  •
                owne
basenesse would sufficiently protect them: what theese
did euer set vpon a begger? or who euer hung vp nets in
the ayre to catch butter-flies? or how fals it our, that nature
hath not sensed alike, the more delicious fruites,

               egrannet? but the wilde

boare out of the wood may roote them vp, &amp; the wilde
beasts of the field may deuour them. Hath nature taken
the charge of the least, and seemes she to be so negligent
in the greatest and best? where is the indulgencie
and goodnes of nature, especially considering that with
so great ease, she is able to preserue her selfe, making
her selfe a hedge to her selfe? but leauing the rest, that is
the best of the fruites, and therefore best worthy of the
keeping to mans prouidence, Lord! what labour and
watchfulnes is required, not only in the planting, but
likewise the same labour is continued in the preseruing.
            Shall I tell you the reason? As the minde of man is ouergrowne
with bryers and brambles, prickt with her
thoughts,The weeds of the earth argue the weeds of mans mind. and stung with a sting of conscience: so the
body by a rule of iustice and equalitie, must likewise be
outwardly tormented. And as man in the pride of his
heart, presumed to eate the forbidden fruit: so on the
contrary, that it might appeare, that he had no right to
the least fruite of the garden, to the meanest thing in
nature, but onely by the diuine permission, therefore the
meanest thing in nature shal reuenge that high presumption
and violent intrusion of man. But now that
I am prickt with the thornes, or bitten with the serpent,
me thinkes my wound cancars; alasse alasse I am poysoned,
I am poysoned, and therefore no maruaile, if at
length I burst forth and lay open my poyson, and
speake a little of the nature of poyson. I speake not improperly,
for nature hath hatched this poyson, and therefore
there is a nature of poyson: I will onely speake of
plants and of beasts, and I wil not heere dig vp the earth
to search for the minerals, I will reserue them for some
better occasion.
            The Philosophers, who were the best spokes-men in
natures defense, doe assigne this reason, that necessary

it was,Of poysons. that of the poyson of the earth, serp
                  ••
               ts and
plants (both poysonous) should be produced; and being
once produced, they should likewise feede and consume
the remainder of that poyson, that so the hearbes
and the plants, the ayre, earth, and the water▪ might be
the more wholesome and sauoury. But heere I will enter
the lists with Philosophy; I confesse indeed, that if
you will necessarily suppose a poysonous matter, then
God hath ordained them for the best, who being all
good in himselfe, can change and alter the nature of euill,
and turne it to good; but heere is the question, why
should nature admit any poysons? for poysons consists
in the extremitie of qualities, especially of the first qualities:

in their owne natiue and proper qualities: or suppose,
that this might, happen in regard of the mixture
and concoction, as it were drawing out a quintessence,
pressing and including much qualitie in a little quantitie;
yet that it should be the end and scope of nature, in
effecting whereof, nature should rest contented, as hauing
attained her owne end, and not rather a passage

natures intent, as it is directed to ripenesse and some

as if they were essentiall parts belonging to natures
perfection, it must needes argue that nature her selfe is
poysoned, and iustly punished for mans contempt, in
seasing vpon the forbidden fruit, the deliciousnes wherof,

should not share in the bootie? that the Sun in the
heate and drought of the day, should finde no opposition
by the Moone in the moysture and couldnesse of the

Mars committed adultry in the absence of Saturne;
but how can nature excuse her selfe? especially considering,
that the seasons of the yeere mutually succeeding
each other, are contrary to each other; why should they
not then vndoe that, which others haue done? confesse,
confesse, that nature her selfe is poysoned, poysoned
with sinne, poysoned with corruption, she offers man

            That there is no necessity of poysons, consider, that
there are great kingdomes in the world, which are exempted
and priuiledged from any poysonous hearbe or
beast,All countries do not bring forth poysons. suppose Ireland; and least you might ascribe it to
their bogs or their vermin, which seeme to consume &amp;
to swallow vp that seed, which should ingender the
poyson, I would gladly aske, why should not nature
be as wise and as prouident in other nations, to preuent
the like mischiefe, though by the same meanes? others
not sticking in their bogs, nor eaten vp with their lice,
flie to their climate; but doe not other countries adioyning

and bordering, stand in the same climate? I will
therefore make a second instance heere in England, the
Roodings of Essex (a very handfull of ground) are freed
from all poysonous matter, heere are no bogs nor no
vermine; or how will you suppose any difference of
climate? not any part of this kingdome is generally
more annoyed with venemous creatures, then is the
country adioyning, being a wood-land, a deepe could
clay, and heeretofore the whole country was forrest.
I confesse indeed, that any forged or supposed reason
framed and fashioned vpon all occasions, within the
minte of mans braine, may serue to excuse his owne ignorance,
mundū tradidit disputationi eorū. My opinion
is, that as poysons do argue the corruption of nature in
generall: so nature in particular, is sometimes priuiledged
by an especiall warrant and protection vnder Gods
owne signet, (though otherwise I doubt not, but it is by
naturall meanes, for God doth not exclude nature, but
rather include her, as being his owne appointed ordinance,
the course, rule and lawe of the creatures). And
thus God permitteth nature both to shew her integritie,
and to boast of her perfection, that although she be
corrupted, yet is it onely some accidentall corruption;
and being thus corrupted, she seemes to make some recompence
with the pleasant change of variety.
            That the punishment of nature may further appeare;
I would gladly aske, that if there be poyson so horrid, as
that in an instant it can sodainly kill:All poysons do not immediatly worke, but after a certaine time. why should there
not be a right contrary quality, which might preserue
in an instant, and be as beneficiall to nature, as the other
is dreadfull and horrid? I haue heard much speech
of Aurūpotabile, but I see it confuted by a whole Colledge
of physitions. Now I will begin to tell you a mysterie,
it seemes as impossible to prescribe a iust time and
period of death, as it is to p
                  •
               eserue life; the houre of

mans death being as vncertaine, as is the frayle course
of his life. Yet such is the nature

                and working of poysons,
that being taken, they shall not discouer themselues,
they shall not bewray their owne treacherie, but
as if they were confederate with the nature of our bodies,
they shall lie hidden and secret, vntill they may
worke their owne ends; Posuit sibi iniquitas gradus, as
if they were part of our nourishment, part of our bodies,
or had entred a league of amitie and friendship
with vs, they shall worke at leysure, and by degrees vndermine
the foundation of life; so that poysons now taken,
after many moneths or many yeeres shall appeare
in effect and operation.
            Because this may seeme strange to diuers, therefore
I will lay open the reason; certaine it is, that there are
medicines appropriated onely for certaine parts,The reason why poysons should so long conceale their conspiracie. which
notwithstanding their passage and conueyance thorough
the trunke of the whole body, yet will stay their
operation, vntill they meete with that fit obiect, whereunto
they are directed by nature, and helped by the
cunning and skill of the Physitian. This is the ground
and foundation of all Physicke; for otherwise all the

               s should worke onely and immediatly on the stomacke
and liuer, without any further relation to the
parts or disease: now as it is in medicines, so is it in poysons,
which haue their antipathie to certaine parts of
mans bodie; Cantharides to the bladder, the Diamonds
to the Lungs, seuerall purgations (which are remissiuely
poysons) to the seuerall humors. Now considering
that there is a great difference in the parts of mans body,
some are more ignoble and base than others, such as
we may best spare, and are of the least vse, and therefore
may daylie consume, and yet the decay not appeare in
the vitall faculties (suppose the lungs or the sple
                  •
               ne)
and yet the poyson being once harboured in those

parts, shall carrie in it selfe an vnresistable power, and
by degrees obtaine the victorie and conquest. Some
thing likewise may bee ascribed to the remotenesse of
the parts, in regard of the great distance and hard accesse
of the poyson; thus is man subiect to the outward
and inward annoyance of the creatures, as was the abuse,
so is the punishment. Of whom shall we expect for
redresse, but of thee (O Lord)? thou that wert crowned
with a garland of thornes, and fedde with vineger and
gaule vpon the holy altar of thy crosse; thou that diddest
take vpon thee the person of whole mankinde, take away
this cup of our poyson, feede vs with thine owne flesh, refresh
vs with thine owne blood, and being made liuely
members of thy mysticall bodie, let this cup passe from vs,
this cuppe of bitternesse and sorrow; take away the poyson
of our nature, the poyson of sinne, and sow in our hearts
the seede of eternitie, that so we may rise againe with bodies
immortall, incorruptible freed as from the poyson of
sinne, so from the poyson of the creatures, the one being
the vndoubted token and punishment of the other.
            
            Now let vs come to man, and consider man in himselfe,The punishment of nakednesse.
seeing the creatures doe thus combine against
him, let vs see how fitly man is disposed to resist, and to
encounter their assaults; let vs see his armour, his weapons,
his furniture. What Prince warring against another,
doth not first consider his owne strength, and the
power of his aduersarie? Behold then, this great champion
how he enters into the combate: Nudus egreditur
de vtero matris sue, &amp; nudus illuc reuertitur, Naked
he comes out of his mothers wombe, and naked he
shall returne againe; Here you see the whole course of
his passage, so that his nakednesse is his punishment:
Gen. 3. 10. &amp; 11. Because I was naked, therefore I hid
my selfe; and God said, who tolde thee that thou wast naked?
&amp;c. For in the time of his innocencie, though hee

should haue been naked without clothing, yet shame
should not haue accompanied his nakednesse; as hee
should haue bin without vesture or garment, so there
should haue bin no vse either of vesture or garment. He
should not haue been subiect to the annoyance of the
creatures, for his innocencie should haue protected
him; there his nakednesse should haue bin his beauty
and perfection; as the child in the wombe, though naked,
yet neither feeles the scorching heate, or the nipping
frost; but liues in a temperat zoane: but the state
and condition of those times being now altered and
changed, why should not nature make her prouision
accordingly? Why should she not worke her owne
proper effects, and be as beneficiall to man, as to all other
creatures in generall?
            For it is naturall to all creatures, that receiuing fit
nourishment, part of it should bee turned to the flesh,
and part to the fleece;Mans clothing should proceed from his food, as well as his nourishment. some should renew the decayed
spirits, some repaire the bones, some playster the flesh;
and for the remainder, it should serue for the outward
couering and beauty, as haire, feathers, wooll, &amp;c. Now
for mans food, assuredly it is much better then theirs,
why should it not euery way be alike beneficiall? shall
nature leese that in mans nourishment, which she can
so profitably imploy in all other creatures, to adorne the
proud peacock, to beautifie the phesant; shall this bee
vainely spent or cast away in mans concoction? Not onlie
in the sensitiue, but likewise in the vegetatiue creatures,
the same foode giues them both nourishment to
preserue them, beauty to adorne them, and strength to
inable them, and garments to shelter them against any
outward violence. The trees, which are of strongest constitution,
and longest continuance; yet hath it pleased
God to couer them with a stiffe hide, (the barke) which
from the roote, still followes the trunke vnto the branches,

and fruite; the sap and iuyce whereof strengthens
and fastens our leather. Thus in all creatures nature desires
to ingraft this opinion, that her perfection est ab
intra, appeares in her most hidden workes, and in her
secret pauilion; and therefore whatsoeuer appeares to
the outward shewe, is but the fruite of her excrements.
            Or why should nature be partiall in man, to adorne
the head, the browes, and the chin, with a couering of
soft haire,Why some pars should be couered and not all. and to leaue the rest of the members naked
and comfortlesse; as if there were not the like vse and
necessity in all? heere we see what she was able to doe
in the rest, that thou mightest ascribe this to the indulgencie
of nature, and not to the earth, which should
decke and adorne all parts alike, and should begin with
the lowest: or rather God himselfe hath ordained it, that
one part should remaine couered, which man himsefe
might vncouer in the honour and seruice of his God;
and thereby acknowledge the nakednesse and impotency
of the whole. For (doubtlesse) it stood with the
bounty and goodnesse of nature, either to make man
not wanting any such shelter of excrements, thorough
multitudes of hot and vitall spirits, suppose the eyes and
the face, which finde little annoyance by any vnseasonable
weather; or if mans feeblenesse shal require them,
then vpon the same conditions to supply them in man,
as well as in all the rest of the creatures.
            You will say, that nature hath left him destitute of
garments, as hauing prouided for him, a large and sufficient
wardrop,Nature is heerin more beneficiall to other creatures then vnto man. euen all the skins of the creaturs, &amp;c. It
should seeme then, that man is their seruant to weare
their cast-away garments; but I pray' hath not man a
strength of his owne, though otherwise he can vse the
strength of horses to performe his owne labour? It were
to be wisht, that for want of others (suppose a case of
necessity), man might haue some clothing &amp; garments

of his owne, to couer his nakednesse. If the dissolute
riot of man were such, that he should make waste of all
and sell all to the bare skin; if his improuidence were
such, that he would neuer prepare for the could winter,
or ould age; yet shal nature seem to neglect man, which
clothes the Lilies of the field? In euery well ordered
state, besides the priuat possessions of euery man in particular,
there should be something in common, whereof
it should not lie in the power of the vnthrift to bereaue
himselfe; and heereof no man should haue the
propriety, but it should bee the Lords waste foyle for
the vse of his tenants. Now suppose, that man had any
such proper garment, yet hee might exchange it, or adorne
it at his pleasure; the head though couered with
haire, yet the barbour might trim it, it might be deckt
with the cap and the feather, with the hood, the iewels
and costly attire; to haue of thine owne, it doth not disparage
thy right and title to theirs.
            According to the diuersitie of mans parts, giue me
leaue to make a double nakednesse of man, inward and
outward;The inward and outward nakednesse. the soule is naked and emptie, she hath lost all
her ornaments of grace, of sanctitie and knowledge,
and seemes to be much defectiue in her natural powers:
for in the dead embers of mans fall, you shall finde very
fewe, and those very obscure sparkes of our reason. All
her knowledge is gotten by learning, and hauing once
attained knowledge she cannot easily retaine it; as if
learning (like a garment) did grow ould and did weare
out with vse. But obserue a greater difficulty, seldome
or neuer shall you finde, that the minde inwardly, and
the body outwardly are deckt and garnisht alike; it
should seeme, that there is an opposition betweene
both, or that God hath concluded by a law of necessitie,
that there should be a nakednesse: the more nice, curious
and costly the Gallant seemes in his outward habit

and garments, the more his minde is neglected
with inward good qualities and vertues; for his time
and disposition can not suffice him, to intend both alike;
and therefore there must bee a nakednesse. Consider againe,
that in euery dumbe creature there is some
strange instinct of nature, both for defence and preseruation
of it selfe, as likewise for the vse and seruice of
man: whereat the poore sillie Philosopher stands wondering
and is astonisht, can say little to the purpose, only
concludes, that it is a certaine notion, imprinted in
the fansie, &amp;c. Then why should nature be so destitute
in respect of grace, being onely directed to grace? yet
there is an emptinesse or a nakednesse in the vnbeleeuing
heart of man, to the high mysteries of Gods kingdome;
we are blinde, and by the weakenesse of our naturall
light, wee cannot discerne the sunne-shine of
grace. And thus we striue and contend with the powers
of darkenesse and ignorance, and thus the life of man is
a warfare here vpon earth: Behold, O Lord God of hoasts,
fighting thy battailes, wee doe expect thy wages and pay,
for no man wageth warre at his owne charge: giue vs the
brestplate of Faith, the sword of thy Spirit, the helmet of
Saluation; that as this warre is a spirituall warre, against
the powers of sinne, hell and damnation; so graunt, that
the carnall man being naked and destitute of himselfe,
may receiue fit weapons from thy armorie to fight in thy
battailes.
            
            For the outward nakednesse of his bodie, it should
seeme that man is dismissed of Gods seruice, hauing
now lost his liuerie, his badge, and his cognizance; or
naked he is,The outward nakednesse of man. that thou (O Lord) mightest entertaine him
to thy seruice; naked hee is, that hee might wholy distrust
in his owne strength, and hauing no shelter of
himselfe, he might desire the protection and shadow of
thy wings; naked hee is, to shew his condition, that

whatsoeuer he hath, he hath it by begging; and therfore
naked he is, to moue thy pity and compassion; hee is a
pilgrime heere vpon earth, and hath no permanent city,
and therefore naked he is, and must hasten to runne his
race, and in another world must expect the change and
variety of his garments; for heere naked he is, he is falne
among theefes, and is robd of his garments, as he descended
from Ierusalem to Ierico; naked he is, and therfore
cannot conceale the spots of his nature: naked he
is, and therefore fit to be washt, fit to be dipt in the lauer
of Baptisme; or if he shall offend thee (O Lord), naked
he is, and may easily be scourged with the rod of thy
vengeance; naked hee is, that being clad with the garments
of dead creatures, feeding on the carkasses of
dead creatures, he might call to minde his owne death,
and run a course of mortification and sorrow. For naked
he is, and thus nature hath disposed him, and yet he is
ashamed of his owne nakednesse, and therfore he must
be ashamed of his owne nature, and so consequently accuse
the corruption of his nature.
            Will you yet heare some further corruption, which
appeares in our nakednesse? in stead of confessing our
crimes,The abuse of apparell. loe! heare our abuse: whereas apparell was only
ordained for the necessity of our bodies, and for the decencie
of our members, now it serues as an occasion of
our wantonnes &amp; pride. Nature her selfe makes a difference
betweene creatures of diuers regions and places;
but our curiosity is such, that we must borrow from seuerall
nations, the variety and forme of their attires. So
nature hath fitted euery nation with garments best for
their vse: The English cloth is the only good shelter,
against the could Northern blast; and the Camels haire
yeelds a better shade in Sowthern regions: but we
cannot thus content our selues with natures appointment;
and whereas by the orderly course of nature,

there should appeare some difference of mens conditions
in their outward habits, for so the horse appointed
for the seruice of war, is better shaped then the hackney
or cart-horse: yet the abuse of man is such, that whereas
his clothing should only couer his shame, now it
must serue to discouer his pride, and bee a token of his
brauery and boasting; so that considering the ould
world, and their homely attyres, you would suppose in
these dayes, all men to be Princes, were it not, that if
there be Princes, then must there be slaues, by a necessity
of relation.
            Nature hath appointed two seuerall features, differing
in quantitie, lineaments, beauty, and proportion
to the two seuerall sexes;The wantonnes and pride in apparell. but strange it is among men,
how the one doth incroach vpon the other, much against
the leuitical law, which forbad the like garments
to both: you shall finde viros molles &amp; effoeminatos, as
likewise woemen Viragines like Amazons; men in their
pouders, perfumes, false haires and paintings, exceeding
the wantonnesse of woemen; and woemen in their habits
and vestures seeme to exceede their owne sex, to
the strange confusion of nature. Againe the garments
should suppose a congruity to the foundation of mans
body, but I feare nature is somtimes inforced, (for heere
she is pend vp and encaged) to make the body seeme
fine and straight; and by and by with loose sailes, wee
seeme to make waste in the blessings of nature. I shall
not neede to spend much time in speaking of our abuse
in this kinde; it hath bin the common complaint of all
ages, but especially of ours, which exceedes all former
times, and shewes her owne vanity from the costly attire
of the head, to the golden rose on the shooe: though
we can neither eate nor drinke gould with Midas, yet
we can wastfully spend it in wearing, and sometimes
our whole treasure appeares on the backe; and thus

man out of the poyson of his owne nature, turnes that
punishment which God inflicted for mans correction
and amendment, to be a further occasion of his sinne.
I will onely put him in minde, that of himselfe he is naked,
his cloathes are but borrowed, mo

be such, if his change of rayments be such, then

should seeme is very fit and agreeable to his nature:Euery man is a labourer. for
naked he is, and therefore you cannot expect any high
dignitie and calling; some plow-man or day-labourer,
heere is his profession. That the same iudgements of
God might appeare in all his workes, whereas the earth

of thy browes thou shalt eat thy bread, Gen. 3. 19. Heere
it should seeme, that all trades and honest courses of life
are erected, for euery man is a labourer, and should intend
some course of life: if his hand be not fitted to the
plowe, yet he must ouerlooke his owne seruants, command
them their taske, and manage his owne priuat estate.
Heere is his carefulnesse, heere is his husbandry
and tillage: and assuredly the seru

               emes to bee

imployed in euery mans labour, and to yeeld strength
and vertue to their hands and actions. Thus to be man, it
is to enter a seruice, and to binde himselfe prentise to all
drudgery; while other creatures liue at harts ease, they
neither sowe not mowe, but keep a continual holy-day;
they sit downe to eate and to drinke, and rise vp to
play: only man must take care and thought both for
them and himselfe; and therin must giue an account of
his steward-ship.
            Not only the body must be clothed and fed, but the
minde must likewise bee taught and instructed: and
heere we seeme to run through an infinit course of our
studies.Mans continuall labours, both for the maintenance of his body, and for the instructing of his mind. The Philosopher, though his body rest, though
he sits in his study by a candle light, yet his minde is in
continuall motion, climing vp from earth vnto heauen;
a strange and violent ascent (I confesse) whereunto
he shal not attaine without great labour and difficulty,
not without great perill and danger. For his body is
dried vp and withered before the approch of his age, as
if he had passed through the element of fire; now at
length hauing fast hould on the sun, and the heauens;
he is carried round about the world with their motion,
viewing whole nature, sed ca

take heede least with the violent turning, he bring himselfe

the trades-man and plow-man suppose to be the idle &amp;
loytering profession, assuredly it is the most painfull and
laborious. The Lawyer, in opening the cause and deciding
the right, as it were appointing the iust bounds of
euery mans possession, shall finde it a more difficult labour,

his sences. The magistrat in his gouernmēt is not

vs this principle, and to infuse it in the heart of man, for
in our idlenesse we are alwaies most imployed, but it is
in ill doing, Nihil agendo malè agere discimus: 
               
                  〈◊〉
               
seemes to rouse and inforce vs to action, in so much that
all our sports and pastimes are in veritie and truth, labours,
howsoeuer we may repute thē for recreations &amp;
sports. And therefore our natural rest or sleepe, we must
esteeme it a death, we are laide in our winding sheetes,
our senses fayle vs, somno sepulti, wee are couered with
darkenesse, here is our death; and after death, beholde
our resurrection, wee were sowne in weakenesse, wee
shall rise againe in power, the decayed spirits renewed,
our bodies strengthened, and then wee returne to our
seuerall callings and professions: and thus our rest
tends to our labours, nature is defined to bee the mother
of motion, motion is the companion of life,
and an inseparable accident to the creatures in generall.
            But I will tie my selfe more strictly to speake of the
curse; see then the correspondencie of Gods iudgements
to the creatures in generall, but especially to
man in particular, for the whole curse must fall vpon
man; and therefore God hath appoynted, that the
earth should bring forth briers &amp; brambles, that so mā
might be tied to vse his own labour for his sustenance
and foode; see here the same wisdome and prouidence
of God appeares in both:Why should not the earth bring forth corne, is well as other fruits? now I would gladly aske,
why should the earth bring forth naturally fruite, fit
for the nourishment of beasts, and yet mans body consisting
of like flesh, should bee destitute of like foode?
Why should not the earth as well bring forth of her
selfe, graine, corne, wheate, barlie, rie, without the
yearely labour, tillage and husbandry of man; as grasse,
Apricocks, Pomegranates, Cherries, which seeme to be
as rare in nature, and as difficult in production? how

shall man onely intend the glorie of his Maker, and returne
due thankefulnesse to his God and Creator for all
his blessings, which was the scope and end of his creation,
if these base offices▪ this kitchen-businesse and seruice
shall giue him a sufficient taske, and take vp his
time with imployments? certainely Gods seruice was
the end of mans making, and this after-drugerie proceedes
from the corruption of nature, an accessarie punishment
accompaning our sinne.
            But I pray' let vs examine, why should not the earth
bee as beneficiall to man,No such difficulty in the production. for his foode, as to the rest of
the creatures? at first the earth (without plowshare or
harrow) brought forth these graines, suppose Barlie or
Wheate; why should not the beneuolence of nature
appeare as well in the preseruation of them, as in other
fruites? You will say, that it proceedes from the excellencie
of the graine; this is your error, for at first, there
was no greater difficultie in their production, for there
was nothing, and therefore there could be no resistance
of Gods power, as not in the least, so not in the greatest;
as it was in the production, so should it bee in the
preseruation, the blessing was equally imparted to all,
crescite &amp; multiplicamini, if more be required, nature
as she affoords the excellencie, so she should supplie the
defects, and in their owne proper places and wombes,
you shall finde as easie generation of the sweete Almond,
the delicious Date, the wholesome Nutmeg, as
you see in our common hedges of Crabs, Slowes,
Blackberies and the like; if all places serue not for their
plantation, acknowledge natures defect, which is the
scope and marke that we shoot at?
            That a perfect drugerie might appeare in man, suppose
that a poore mans childe were now borne into the
world; at first, either with his fathers labour, or at the
parish charge, together with the charitie of well disposed

people,The progresse and degrees of mans labour. he must bee kept and sustained: now hee is
in the forme of a Beads-man, in his blew coate, and his
blew cap, holding vp his innocent hands vnto Heauen,
to pull downe a blessing vpon the heads of all his good
benefactors and founders: (O all yee rich men of the
world, if euer pittie and compassion could mooue your
hearts, looke vpon these sillie poore innocent babes; who
neuer offended either God or man, but onely in the sinne of
their conception: heere your charitie bestowed, shall bee
without exception, for they cannot counterfeite; they are
young beginners, giue them a stocke, and like seede sowne
vpon good ground, it shall againe returne vnto you with
full measure and thankefulnesse) when at length hee
comes to the age of ten yeeres, then hee beginnes his
taske, hee must worke to purchase his owne foode, to
buy his rayments, to get his strength, his growth, and
his nourishment; for nature onely supplies life, she laies
onely the foundation, and this life must bee continued
and prolonged by such meanes, which he himselfe hath
bought with his own labours: now no man can worke
without tooles, (the plough, the mattocke, the spade),
and these tooles must first bee prouided with his owne
labours; hauing both strength and tooles, there must
be a skill and cunning to worke, and this skill is gotten
by experience, learning, and his owne labours; now he
is sufficiently prepared of himselfe, but where will hee
worke? either hee must first purchase his timber, his
stuffe or his ground, or else he must drudge for another,
to worke in his vineyeard, as if he were to create a new
world for himselfe, before he could take the possession
of this world.
            Let vs (with compassion) descend to the lowest degree
and state of men; that a man might be a drudge,
not onely to other men of the same kinde, in the nature
of a seruant; that he might haue worke to imploy himselfe,

that with his owne honest labours hee might get
his owne liuing;Man is a druge to the dumbe creatures. but (I say) that he might bee a drudge
to the dumbe creatures, that he might be admitted to
keepe another mans horses, to feede his dogges, to attend
his sheepe, to waite on his swine, here is his suite,
here is a great poynt of his happinesse: it should seeme
hee wants letters of recommendation for such a high
preferment. It were to be wished, that the rich men of
this world, would imploy some part of their wastefull
expense, in setting poore labourers on worke; that they
would take some pleasure to trie conclusions in nature,
and that our lawes, which prouide in this case, were better
executed, as they were in former times, and as at this
day is practised in other nations.
            But suppose him to be thus set on worke, yet he cannot
secure himselfe of his owne health,His pouerty, notwithstanding his drudgery. and of the vse of
his limmes and his members (though I acknowledge
that by Gods prouidence, his labour may serue as an excellent
meanes to preserue health, which indeede sweetens
his labour, and makes his condition equall to the
rich men of this world; for I had rather imploy my
limmes and my ioynts in an outward worke, then inwardly
to suffer the conuulsion of mine owne bowels;
I had rather sweate outwardly, then that a violent vnnaturall
heate should distemper my bodie) all his daies
gettings shall onely serue him from hand vnto mouth;
if sicknesse attach him, he shall feele his owne wants; if
wife and children proue troublesome, he shall be inforced
to craue almes and beneuolence; if fire or water
doe trespasse him, then hee must haue a collection; and
in his olde age, when his worke beginnes to faile him,
then meanes must be wrought, that he may be put in an
hospitall: euery thing runnes in a circle, he began with
the spittle, and hee must end in an hospitall, where hee
shall finde the vncharitable disposition of this world to

exceed the cold distemper of his weake and crasie body;
hui quàm miserum est nasci! If I were in such case as
I conceaue the yong child, and could foresee the whole
course of mine owne miseries, it should be a principall
point in my prayers, that God hauing once shewne me
this world, hee would in his mercy lead me from the
wombe to the graue, and take me to his owne protection,
before my life were tainted with sorrow, or my vnderstanding
corrupted with the wickednesse of this
world.
            Leauing the persons of men, I will consider their labours,
and setting aside all other trades and professions,
I will only choose the most ordinary calling of men,Mens continuall labours in husbandry and tillage.
which indeed is the best and the most necessary, I will
instance in husbandry &amp; tillage; the sower goeth forth
to his labour, some fals vpon rockes, some vpon sands,
some vpon thornes, the least part fals on the good
ground, heere is the losse of his seede, the losse of
his labour: now this good ground, it was first made
good, it was mealowed and mended, and had many
tilths; heere is a continuall taske for man and for beast,
they run in a circle, according to the seasons of the
yeare, they haue their times for their different labours,
in sowing, and mowing, in keeping and reaping the
seed and the weed, the least drought in the sowing, the
least moysture in the reaping, any vnseasonable weather
spoyles their whole haruest; euery second or third yeere
the ground must lie fallow, and heere is nothing but
barennesse, nature seemes wholy vnprofitable; alas how
shall the poore tennant discharge his rent? for heere is
only hope and expectation of a future crop, which the
good husband some two yeeres hence, may take as the
fruites of his labour, and in the interim may bequeath
it to the vnborne, and vnbegotten child for a legacy.
But suppose him now at length, to haue the quiet and

peaceable possession of his owne crop, a fift part of his
corne shall be spent againe in his seed, an other part
shall be spent to hearten the poore beasts in their trauell,
very little will remaine for the houshold prouision,
or the market commoditie; and being thus safely lodged,
yet he shall not bee excused of his labour, the
thresher, the miller, the baker, all of them very painefull
and laborious trades will testifie as much.
            I know not, how far I may presume vpon mans patience,
but truely I am very fearefull in speaking of those
things,Gods mercy and prouidence appeares in our labours. which might any way concerne our thankfulnes
to God; and therefore giue me heere leaue to make
some recompence, least mans labour might seeme to detract
from Gods goodnes and prouidence, the one
serues as a iust punishment of sinne, the other as an earnest
of Gods mercy and our redemption. It is the goodnesse
of God, that first gaue man his seed, and teacheth
him to know the times and the seasons, inables him to
worke, giues him the grace to follow his calling, preserues
nature in her own kinde, and concurr's with the
second causes in their effects and operations. It is the
prouidence of God, that the seed being once dissolued
should send downe a roote, should send vp a blade, that
it should be moystned with the first and the latter raine,
that by degrees according to the funnes heat, it should
gather strength; that the morning dew should preserue
it from withering, that the white snow like a warme
fleece should keep it from freesing, while with the hard
frost the ground should be mealowed, the wormes killed,
and the weeds nipt and consumed. It is the mercy
of God, that the seed comming forth should returne againe
(with great thankfulnesse and vsury) straw and
chaffe for the vse of beasts, and corne for the food of
man; this corne to be inclosed in an eare, fortified with
pikes, least the foules of the ayre should seaze vpon it,

laid vp in a huske, least the winde should scatter it, or
the water should rot it; and that within the compasse of
one moneth, all the whole yeeres prouision might bee
brought into the barne; and whatsoeuer remaines in
the field should first serue, as gleanings for the poore, thē
feed the foules of the ayre and the beasts of the field,
nothing is lost, the very stuble shall serue to enrich the
ground; and as the fruites of the earth do satten the
beasts, so the dung of beasts doth satten the earth. Thus
euery way you see the prouidence of God, which prouidence
is most especially directed to man, and therfore
acknowledge, that mans labour and drudgerie is the
fruit of his sinne, the fruit of his fall, and not to be numbred
among the fruits of the garden. God that feedes
the rauens from heauen, who openeth his hands and
filleth euery liuing thing with his blessings, as he made
man without man, preserues mans life without his priuitiue,
so (with the same ease) he might haue fed him as
one of his sonnes, or one of his houshold seruants and
familie; were it not, that man with his own sinne hath
made himselfe a stranger, and an alien to his God and
Creator.
            As I haue noted out the curse, so giue me leaue for
our instruction to point at our abuse; the punishment
was the labour of man,All honest callings appointed by God. now man in stead of patience in
bearing this yoake, and obedience in vndertaking the
taske, and conforming himselfe to Gods lawe, desires
nothing so much as to frustrate the sentence of God,
and to auoid the punishment; especially in these last
dayes, which is the ould age of the world, we intend
nothing more then our idlenesse and sloth, sometimes
vnder the faire shew of sanctity. Whereas certaine it is,
that all honest callings and vocations of men they are
Gods owne ordinance, in performing them we doe
God seruice, bis orat qui bene laborat, the workes haue

by the former and better times of our forefathers,
namely the inclosing of common fields, when the land
leeseth his owne proper and naturall vse, God hauing
ordained it for tillage, wee must conuert it to pasture:
whereas corne is such a soueraigne and pretious commoditie,
being indeed the ground-worke of a kingdome,
whereupon all our plenty consists; in so much
that other wise and politicke states, (as the Florentines)
will suffer no corne to be at any time transported; shall
kingdomes bereaue themselues of their weapons and
sell them to strangers? heere is the staffe of life, the
staffe of bread, Leuit. 26. 26. Heere is our best weapon,
shall we leaue our selues destitute of this weapon, only
thorough our owne sloth? wherefore serue the inclosures,
but only to the inhauncing of the Lords rent, and
for the idlenesse of the tenant? whereas certaine it is,
that better it were in a state, for men to bee wholy vnprofitablie
imployed, then for want of imployment
they should be left to their owne disposing; wherein
you shall finde not only the losse of their time, but other
vitious and dissolute courses, as drinking, gaming, riot,
quarelling, and sometimes seditious tumults. Most certaine
it is, that the kingdome is heerby greatly impouerished;
for those lands inclosed are not able to maintaine
such numbers of men, so many horses fit for the
seruice of war, such prouision for our plenty, in a foure-fold
proportion, as formerlie they did, lying open and
in tillage. Where is the ancient strength of England,
how easily may we be vanquisht? if in the best soyle,
townes shall be thus vnpeopled: why doth our lawe
so much intend tillage? why doth our law preuent inmates
and cottages? if on the other side, notwithstanding
the increase and multiplying of people, yet villages
shall be ruinated, and all must serue for the shepheard;

infinit are the inconueniences which I could
speake of inclosures, but I will conclude all with this
one rule in lawe, interest reipublicae, vt ne quis re sua malè
vtatur.
            
            Many and great are the iudgements of God, which
from time to time haue followed the first authors
and first beginners of inclosures; but you shall giue me
leaue to prophesie a iudgement.A prophesie against our inclosures. That I may speake for
this climat of England, giue me leaue to compare this
great kingdome to a body: as in the middest of a body
the heart is only the fountaine of all vitall bloud, which
it sends forth and conuayes in her conduit-pipes, to all
the seuerall parts of the body; so me thinkes, God hath
ordained this kingdome, that in the middest of it there
should bee the heart, the richest and fa

which might send forth plenty of corne to all the bordering
skirts, which as they haue the benefit of waters
for the carriage of their commodities, so are they not in
themselues such fruitfull corne grounds; yet if any part
of the world be sufficiently prouided with graine, for
the most part our sea-cost townes do share in their plenty;
whereas our in-land countries must only relie vpon
their owne prouision, and to that end, God hath giuen
them a soyle fit for that purpose: Now seeing 
                  •
               hat they
haue such inclosures, and that they haue wholly betaken
themselues to their idlenesse and floth, assuredly
whensoeuer it shall please God to send amongst vs, a
punishment of hunger and famine, there the death and
penury shall be greatest, from whence heeretofore wee
haue receiued our greatest supply. Thus man desiring to
escape the punishment of God in his labour, incurr's a
far greater iudgement of God in his famine; if hee will
not sweat in his worke, hee shall starue in his wants.

                  rit maximus in fine, he that shall goe a-stray in

the beginning, shall greatly wander, and with much
difficulty arriue to the end of his iourney. From this
enmity between man and man, when as all things were
distracted, when wisdome was separated from power,
and strength was seuered from charity, considering that
disorder is more perillous then bondage, and confusion
more detested then slauery: that order might keepe all
things within their owne bounds, there did appeare a
necessity of gouernment, and gouernment inforceth a
subiection and thraldome; thus the punishment is not
onely to be tyed to the sex, (for it is a rule in law, partus
sequitur ventrem, if our mothers be in bondage, we appearing
in their wombes, must likewise acknowledge
our iust imprisonment). But it doth generally comprehend
whole mankind, that in regard homo homini lupus,
one man is a wolfe to another, the strongest oppressing
the weakest,Man is sometimes subiect to the tyrannie &amp; oppression of others. some imposing a slauery vpon others, and
there is a generation of men which feed vpon nothing
but mans flesh; therefore (with one ioynt and common
consent) we must submit our selues to a gouernment;
which gouernment, if it containe it selfe within his own
iust limits and boundes, it is the greatest and most soueraigne
blessing, which can happen to man heere in
this life. But for mans sinne, he must likewise be subiect
to the tyrannie of others: seeking protection hee fals
into the den of a Lyon, into the hands of a tyrant, who
delights in cruelty, and hath his rewards appointed for
all such as shall inuent new torments, with roaring
Buls, fierce Tygers, deuouring Beares, and whatsoeuer
else either fire or sword can execute; and yet we must
patiently endure this tyrannie, rather then admit a disorder
and confusion: howsoeuer in particular, those
lawes which tend to bondage and captiuitie, shall haue
all possible fauourable construction, yet when as the
necessity of gouernment, and the well-fare of man shal

inforce a subiection, needes we must bring all men vnder
some yoake, and inforce an obedience; for the dissolute
riot of one is rather to be admitted, then the disorder
of many; the cruelty of one must be suffered, rather
then all should be bloudy; when in regard of mans
corruption, we cannot auoyd all inconuenience, then
reason will admit and tolerat the least.
            Heere appeares the necessity, together with the first
originall of gouernment, when as betweene man and
wife there must be a superiour, a magistrate, a gouernour;
heere appeares the excellency, the sacred and inuiolable
maiesty of gouernment, and that especially of
a Monarchy: notwithstanding that Princes bee of the
same kinde,Princes haue their authority from God. subsisting of the same flesh and bloud with
others, yet ought their power to be respected, though
sometimes for gifts and good qualities, they may be inferiour
to others; for thus between man &amp; wife, though
she be made of the ribs, and euery way equall as touching
her condition, but for her beauty and comlinesse
far excelling man, yet in gouernment she is inferiour
and subiect to man. Subiection must keepe vs from slauery,
thinke not thy life base or a thraldome, when as
marriage (which certainly is a very honorable estate)
must admit a subiection: and as the wife doth fi

from God), it lies not in her power afterward

and now it lies not in their power to reuolt, for who

and proceedings of gouernment, the foundations
whereof were laid in marriage, but an one after it brake

and most vndoubted right of nature, bringing children
into the world, he might safely conduct them; taking
charge of their infancy, he might direct them in

loue, parents did only vse soft weapons, compassionat
perswasions, little able to suppresse sinne. Not long after
issued forth primo-genitura, as being accompanied
with the greatest number of yeares for discretion; so
claiming the greatest part of inheritance, and the highest
honor for gouernment, in memory heereof still wee

some token of his own and only gouernment, when an
entire nation shall vnite and ioyne it selfe together, that
being men of the same kinde, they might be members
of the same body, going hand in hand by euen paces,
whereby they might receiue the fruits of obedience, the
blessings of peace, sustaining all burthens and grieuances
alike, and ready to fight in defence of each other.
            But to returne to the punishment it selfe, which primarily
and especially appeareth in marriage; is it not
sufficient that all the creatures should conspire against
man,How strange it is that there should be enmity in marriage. &amp; the earth it selfe should discouer her own hate,
and seeme to nourish this enmity, but euen flesh of our
owne flesh, two Persons in one body, man and wife
should be seuered in their loue and affections? for you
shall obserue factions and distaste in marriage, not betweene
strangers, not betweene neighbours, not betweene
seruants, not betweene brethren, but in the
married couple, liuing vnder the same roofe, fed at the
same table, resting in the same bed, that sleeping and

waking they might be a helpe to each other, hauing
first made the free and voluntary choyce of themselues,
their possessions alike imparted to both, their bodies
made one, the weaker vessel layd vp in the bosome, and
yet their minds are distracted, they cannot be ioyned in

yong children and babes, the fruitfulnes in their owne
kinde? which indeed is the highest perfection of nature,
and to a christian man, the mysteriall vnion and excellency
of marriage; eleuated from a naturall contract to
the height of a mistery, solemnized in the Church, made
a religious action, God and his officers knitting both
their hands and their hearts, signifying the strong and
indiuisible bonds between Christ and his Church, the
God-head and man-hood in the person of Christ, the
soule and the body in the nature of man, the matter and
forme in the creatures; and thus the whole world consisteth
of marriage and the vniting of couples.
            Do any other creatures of the same kinde, differing
only in sex,How vnnaturall is this enmity in marriage. stand in such enmity to each other? especially
such creatures, in whom nature seemes to obserue the

            Hitherto I haue counseld the husband, now giue me
leaue to informe the wife in her duty, for both may bee
faultie; hath God made her the weaker vessel? then she
wants the protection of her husband;The wife is informed in her duty. is she more impotent
and weake of counsell? then ought she to be instructed
and taught by her husband; hath she committed
her owne person to his custody and charge? then

her busines of right belōgs vnto him. The wife receiues
her honor from her husband, let her honor the stocke,
and she shall be found more honorable; she receiues
her plenty and meanes of liuing from him, for he is lyable
for the payment of her debts, then certainly shee
ought to follow his example, for the course of her

               rge and expense: but nature hath made the woman
gentle, flexible, and compassionat, I shall not need long
to instruct her; only I feare, when I see strife and differences
betweene the married couple, least there were
neuer any perfect vnion; somtimes (indeed) their wealth
is heapt vp together, their substance vnited, when matrimony
becomes only a matter of money; and hee
                  •
               e
they seeme to be in the nature of partners or factors,
ioyning only their stockes or their treasures: sometimes
againe in the blindnes and sudden assault of their lust,
when their bodies are happily vnited, yet their mindes
are separated and distracted, there is no agreement in
their disposition; and this seemes rather a linking together
of dead carkasses or beasts, then an honorable

estate of marriage, eleuated to the hight of a mysterie in
our christian religion.
            There is nothing which breedes that distast in marriage,
(setting only iealousie aside) as when either of
them do in
                  •
               ermedle with the proper duties belonging
to each other,In the house there are seuerall duties belonging to the husband &amp; to the wife. either to the distrust of the honesty, or to
the great disparagement of the wit and iudgement of
each other; both which must vtterly be abandoned and
auoyded in marriage. For man and wife liue in an excellent
society, they haue all things in common, as wee
should haue had in the state of our innocency; and therfore
no maruaile though marriage were first instituted
in paradise: and yet notwithstanding this community,
the offices of the house ought to bee diuided between
both, and neither of them should intermedle with the
others affaires (to the preiudice of either). Which if we
should admit, we should not haue a perfect vnion according
to order, but the one should be swallowed vp,
and both be confounded: as the parts of a mans natural
body, they haue their peculiar offices and duties, notwithstanding
they are parts of one man; and as in the
law there were diuers and distinct garments belo

               ging
to both, and a sinne it was for a man to put on the womans
attire; whereby is signified the seuerall offices of
both, that there being a necessity of each other, receiuing
mutuall helpes from each other, it might serue as
a surer bond of their loue. Thus in nature, the man hath
strength of limbes for his labour, the woman hath
weaknes, yet cleanlines; wherby is signified the seueral
duties of both, whereunto nature hath disposed them,
which ought to be reserued whole and entire to themselues:
thou (that art a husband) make thy selfe no Hermaphrodite,
to busie thy selfe and to prie into euery
action; dost thou distrust the honest and iust dealing of
thine owne wife, then blame thy selfe for thine owne

choice? remember that thou hast made a solemne act
before God, and the congregation, (which now thou
canst not reuoke, or reca
                  •
               l), wherin thou hast endowed
her with all thy worldly goods.
            For iealousie, which so much disquiets and sets such a
difference betweene the married couple, I haue full often
obserued,The fond iealousie of the husband. that the loosenes of the husbands life,
giues him occasion to suspect his innocent wife, as being
guilty to himselfe, and fearing least by the course
of iustice, his owne sinne should bee recompensed with
his owne shame in the same kinde; supposing his owne
vncleannes to bee a naturall in-undation, which hath
ouerwhelmed whole mankind: others though chast,
thorough the impotency and weaknes of their owne
bodies, yet their minde is impure, and therfore they
feare that in others, which they do not finde in themselues.
Now for their punishment, it 
                  ••
               ood with the
iust iudgements of God, that according to their adultery
and fornication conceiued in their owne minde,
so they should perplex and torment themselues with
their owne thoughts. There is yet a third sort of men,
who out of the immoderat loue of their owne wifes,
doting vpon their beauty, being totally carnall, vxorissimi,
neither regarding the brightnes and glory of
the heauens, nor yet the shame &amp; reproch of this world,
they begin to be fond and iealous of their wises; the excesse
of their loue, turnes vnto iealousie; their greatest
comfort, proues their deepest discontentment: and thus
God laughes at the counsels of men, who being the only
true Good, in whom and to whom 
                  •
               ll our loue and
affections should be tending and ending; we diuerting
the streame of our loue, forsaking this onely one good,
as we are distracted in the truth of our loue, so sometimes
wee are distracted in the soundnes of our owne
mindes, and leese our selues in our owne loue, when

the fruits of our loue, proue the fits of our frensie; but O
blessed Lord God, who art the ioy and loue of our hearts,
leaue vs not to our selues; for heere we offer vp our selues
vnto thee, take vs away from our selues into thy most holy
protection; let thy loue bee with our whole heart, and
without measure, as thou thy selfe art good without measure;
and let the loue of the creature, be guided by rule and
proportion still to thy loue, &amp;c.
            
            If this iealousie be conceiued vpon iust grounds, yet
stil I cannot excuse the husband, for certain it is (wherof
we haue examples in Scripture),The abuse of marriage may breed an ill disposition. that there may bee a
foule abuse in marriage; notwithstanding the holinesse
and sanctitie of that high and excellent state, yet there
may be vncleannesse; adulterous thoughts and actions
may passe betweene the married couple, and it is already
concluded among the casuists, that plures mariti abutuntur,
&amp; magis abutuntur statu suo, quàm coelibes
suo, I f
                  •
               are least the wantonnes of marriage, may breed
an ill disposition; if thy wife be somewhat light and of
euill report, then I feare she hath bin brought vp in thy
schoole, she hath learned it of thee, thou hast taught
her this lesson. I would not willingly defile my speech
with this subiect, only giue me leaue to taxe an ill custome
of this world, that in the seeking of our wiues,
we vse such speeches, such gestures, such actions, such
ribaldrie letters, &amp;c. that it is to bee feared, least
yong woemen do heereby first learne to be harlots, before
they are wiues; and therefore no maruaile, if in the
course of their liues, they giue some cause of iealousie,
for heere the husbands haue giuen a bad example, and
laid an ill foundation, &amp;c.
            Thus assuredly the greatest cause of complaint is in
the husband, who hath the gouernment of his wife,
who might in wisdome preuent his owne shame, and
should teach her a modest and chaste carriage; but I

know not what ill spirit hath set them at enmity,A bitter inuectiue against marriage after diuorse. whom
God hath coupled together: sometimes indeed the
streame of the husbands loue, being carried another
way, is apt to cast any aspersion vpon his wiues honesty;
and then he begins to practise with heretickes, and to
commend the law of liberty, that after a diuorse it
should be lawfull to marry againe, and againe. Heere
you shall see large expositions written in defence thereof,
and the opinions of certaine Diuines, Ministers,
Pastors, Superintēdents of ye separated cōgregations, or
the new Churches from beyond the seas, (thus they
would seeme to haue a Catholicke consent) together
with such bitter inuectiues against all superstitious fasts,
calling all chastisements of the flesh, sins against the body.
Here are their wholsome and sound doctrines, their
manifold and good vses, their learned and excellent
applications: thus because God was incarnat, appearing
in the basenesse &amp; frailtie of our flesh, though free from
the sinfulnes and pollution of our nature, therefore do
these men desire to make religion not incarnat, that is,
fitted to mans capacity and apprehension; but a religion
carnall, professing a sanctitie of spirit, in the vncleannes
of the flesh, admitting the loosenesse and sensualitie of
Turkisme, into the strict and austere profession of christianitie,
and here is pure, impure carnalitie. But O thou
monster of men, how many wiues wilt thou abuse in
thy lust? changing thine owne flesh, as if thou wert to
change thine owne garments! notwithstanding the
heate and fury of thy lust, yet God may so dispose it,
that a could and chast bloud, which thou supposest to
be frozen vp with some Northern blast, yet this bloud
may succeed thee, and possesse thy seat and habitation,
when thy memory shall be cleane forgotten, thy name
accursed, and thy seed rooted out in the next generation.

now come to the greatest, a punishment not inflicted
on the creatures,Man is accursed of God. not consisting in the labour or seruice
of man, but primarilie incident to the very person of
man, setting a breach not between the married couple,
but betweene God and man, maledictus homo, Gen. 4.

               ullnesse shall be his habitation,
and he shall least appeare in sight: here I might speake
whatsoeuer hath been spoken concerning the miserable
and sinfull condition of man, for this is the abridgement
and epitomie of all; to forsake God, is to
leaue the fountaine of all good, and to make himselfe
subiect to all miseries and woe. And therefore the righteous
Dauid cries vnto God forsake me not in thine anger,
for whereas the absence or separation of friends,
might be a meanes to asswage their hate, and to reconcile
their enmitie: onely in God, the greatest fruite of
his anger is to leaue and forsake man, and thereby man
is wholly destitute of all possible meanes, to re-obtaine
his fauour.
            Here now at length I see the reason why, all other
creatures receiued their approbation from God in the
beginning, immediatly vpon their creation, Et vidit
Deus &amp; erant omnia vald
                     •
                   bona, and God saw all
things that were, and they were very good in their
owne kinde; and God blessed them, &amp;c. onely man is
excluded,The limitation of this curse. and neuer receiued any such approbation, for
it lay in the power of his free will and election to make
himselfe accursed and miserable, and therefore the sentence
of his approbation was deferred vnto a day of
iudgement to come, venite benedicti, ite maledicti, &amp;c.
The rest of the creatures they may be punisht and accursed
indeede, but it is onely for mans sake, as they are

ordained for mans vse, while man himselfe is the end of
the curse; for nothing can be accursed, but that which
is simply euill, and nothing is simply euill, but only sin;
and no creature in nature is capable of sinne, but only
man, so that man of all other creatures is the most accursed;
only with this difference, Cain was accursed but
not Adam: Adam being the root of mankind, did therfore
represent the nature, Cain being a branch of mankind,
did limit the curse to a certaine condition of men,
to the state of the reprobates. So that a curse is in
                  •
               ident
to the nature, though not to the whole nature of man,
which shall appeare by this one instance; Balaam was
not able to curse the children of Israel, seeing that hee
was then in their loynes, who was indeed the fountaine
of blessing, this blessing we must not only tie to the generation
of Christ according to the flesh, but still wee
may claime the inlarging of Gods mercy, according to
the promise made vnto Abraham, in semine tuo benedicentur
omnes generationes: so that generally God hath
proposed vnto man a blessing, a curse, life or death, the
one as the fruit of mans sinne, the other as the effect of
Gods mercy; the one he incurr's by his own transg
                  •
               essions,
the other hee attaines by his bloud and passion,
who was the attonement and propitiation for our sins.
            
               Cain bearing the person of all reprobates, and being
accursed for the bloud of the innocent Abel, you
might heere expect,The causes of reprobation. that I should describe the nature
and first causes of reprobation, together with the heauy
fruits of Gods vengeance; how God of himselfe may limit
and bound his own mercy, to re
                  •
               use, or assist him,
who is now ready to fall: and yet like a gratious God,
remembring himselfe, together with the scope and end
of our creation, desiring to perfect and accomplish that
image, which hee himselfe hath already begun, as hee
hath giuen the outward meanes for mans happy conuersion,

               ite, praedicate, baptizate, omnes singulos, vniuersos:
As the price of our redemption is infinit, able to satisfie
for the infinit sins, of infinit worlds: so vndoutedly
the same God according to the truth of his owne nature,
will not be wanting in the inward meanes. He will
not feede vs with shewes, and appearance of things
that are not, but with his preuenting, assisting, and subs

               quent
graces, hee will inable our weaknesse in such
things, as do necessarily concerne our saluation; raising
nature to such an height, that she may be able to transcend
her owne naturall power; yet God shall so moue
vs, as may bee most agreeable to our condition. The
kingdome of grace doth not ouerthrow our naturall
rights, and therfore God shal still leaue vnto vs, whol
                  •
               ,
sound, and entire, without violence or coaction, the
free choice, and election of our owne wils: so that if in
his eternall praesci
                  •
               nce he shall fore-see, that man shall
refuse to be the vessell and instrument of grace, to concurre
with him in the action; but shall prefer the creature
before the creator, and so shall continue wilfull
and disobedient in the whole course of his life, with a
finall impenitency; heere is the sole cause and first motiue
of Gods eternall reprobation, which consists of the
foresight of our sinnes, and of the due intended punishment
of Gods iustice.
            The second curse which I will obserue in Cain, is the
guiltinesse of crying sins; for he slew his brother Abell,
whose bloud cryed vp to heauen for vengeance;The gui
                     •
                  tines of crying sins. strange
it is, that man by nature should not be able to eleuat and
lift himselfe aboue nature, to do any worke or action
belonging to grace, not so much as to beleeue any principle
of faith, which to a beleiuing man seemes to be a
point of small difficulty; and yet man should easily descend
beneath nature, to commit sins, whereunto his nature
is no way inclined; such as the light of reason,

them, we proue our owne tormentors: for as

we proue runnagates, that we shelter and hide our own
lookes, yet we carry a worme in our bosomes, that accuseth
vs, and layeth these sinnes to our charge, disquiets
the thoughts, and will not permit the soules rest; and
hauing thus committed, and being thus tormented,
whereas reason should teach them, that the only way
to recompence for the sinne, were to be sorrowfull and
contrite, to aske pardon and forgiuenes, euen for his
sake who died for our sins; yet they will rather continue
in their own filth, and sin against the holy Ghost with
a finall impenitency, and say with that cursed Cain, ma

est delictum meum quàm vt possit remitti, my sinne is
greater then it can be forgiuen. And thus wheras before
they sinned against the rule of Gods iustice, now they
begin to sin against the measure of his mercy; to dispaire
of his mercy, as if his mercy were not infinit, as
well as their sinnes are infinit: as if the price of our redemption
were not sufficient to recompence for their
sinnes; though they haue lost all possible meanes, wherby
they might be saued, yet God hath not lost that absolute
power, wherewith he might saue a penitent sinner.
            This curse of man is so generall, that whatsoeuer is
or can bee spoken for the misery, and punishment of
man, may well be included within the compasse of this

multiplicity of their dignities and stiles, whereas the
great Roman Emperour could content himselfe with
the bare title of Caesar Augustus.
               Mans curse appeares in his reason and in his religion. Sometimes a plenty
breedes want; and diuersitie of matter, (when men
seeme to be distracted with multitudes of thoughts), imposeth
a silence: many dishes, and much variety of
good cheere, rather chokes then prouokes the appetite;
I must therefore limit my speech, and setting a side all
other fruits of this cu
                  •
               se, I will only insist in those two
qualities, which are proper and peculiar to man; his reason,
which sets him aboue creatures; his religion,
which makes him equall to Angels: the one guiding
nature, the other sanctifying nature, mans excellency
consisting in both; and if in both mans frailtie and corruption
shall appeare, then needes you must acknowledge
the curse, and such a curse as cannot descend to
the dumbe creatures, nor cannot ascend to the Angelicall
state, and therefore must needes be proper and peculiar
to man.
            For reason, God hath giuen it man for these two
vses, first for discourse, that men grounded vpon the
same principles of reason,The strange different iudgements of men. should concur in iudgement,

(for the instant) appeares to the outward sight; &amp; therfore
it is a shadow of Gods eternall prouidence and
prescience, wherwith God creating man, made him according
to his owne Image: but now see the curse, that
hath befallen our reason, quot homines tot sententia, so
many men, so many mindes; as if reason were not the
same in all, but that there were different and distinct
rules, and grounds of our reason. As their are fiue senses,
according to the fiue seuerall obiects in our sensible nature:
so our reason (forsooth) must be infinitly multiplied,
according to the number of mens braines, and

the capacity of each vnderstanding; our reason serues
rather to discouer the diuersiti
                  •
                of our opinions and
iudgements, then to inforce an vnitie of consent; wheras
all the rest of the creatures they haue senses alike,
they see alike, feele alike, taste alike; and for their outward
actions, they are all carried with one and the same
instinct of nature, only in men their wayes are in
                  •
               init,
their iudgements infinit; in so much that you might
well doubt, whether they all consist of the same reasonable
soule; and for the dumbe creatures, if you wil take
their whole kinde, together with their naturall actions,
they are much more reasonable, more wise and prouident
in their owne kinde, then is man, notwithstanding
his reasonable soule.
            You will suppose, that I speake only of the promiscuous
multitude, and of such only, whose wit will serue
them to stir vp a difference or doubt, but whose iudgement
is too weake to reconcile the controuersie:The different sects of Philosophers. or you
will thinke that I speake only of neighbours and woemen,
alwayes iarring and dissenting out of their enuie;
or of friends and kindred alwayes in suites of law in a
point of their profit: No verily, but I will instance in
the thrice renowned profession of learning; how many
sects of Philosophers haue the schooles afforded, what
infinit variety &amp; contrariety of opinions? as among the
ancients, according to the number of elements, there
were Aristotelians; who out of their puritie, their light,
and eminency aboue the rest, did seeme to resemble
fier, which hath now at length consumed the rest: then
followed the Platonists, who (like the element of ayre)
inclose all their light in the clouds, or rather indeed do
obscure and conceale it: then comes the Stoicke, who
with the stricktnesse of his life, seemes like a sea-
                  •
               aring
man, lies vpon boards, and feeds vpon water and fish: at
length vp starts the Epicure, who, (like a glutton) runs

ouer the face of the whole earth, from market to market,
to make his best prouision, to offer vp a fat sacrifice
vpon the all-deuouring altar of his belly-god. Heere are
the foure first elements, and from hence proceedes as
great a difference in the opinions of men, as there is variety
in nature; in so much that in the ancient monasteries,
what iars haue past between the Sco
                  •
               ists and
Thomists; between the Reals and Nominals, &amp;c. And
at this time it is not vnknowne,Petrus Ramus censured.
                how Petrus Ramus, a
man of meane knowledge, without any ordinary parts
either of nature or learning; yet through his owne impudency
and pride, (desiring an innouation of all Arts,
to cast all things in a new mould, to build his own fame
in the ruins of others), hath opposed himself, not against
any particular opinion, but against the whole streame
and current of all ancient learning; ouerthrowing the
grounds, principles, and rules of that most illustrious &amp;
thrice renowned Aristotle, whom all ages doe reuerence
and acknowledge to haue bin natures chiefe secretary,
or best counseller of estate, the father of all humane
knowledge: and that which is yet more strange,
this Ramus hath left followers and Disciples behind
him, who seeme to be like affected to the ancient learning,
reducing all things, (euen the very scope &amp; foundation
of arts), to their own fond inuention, and barbarous
innouation. A shame it is, that Colledges and ancient
foundations, should giue harbour to such a wretched
brood; who as they are first nourished vp in obstinacy
and wilfulnes, so they will proue to bee fire-brands
in the Church; who neglecting the fathers, and
all ancient orders and decency, shall with their owne
furious and witles conceits, set the whole world in combustion.
            The second vse of reason is, according to the nature
of the reasonable soule (which is spiritual), to raise man

from the visible creatures, to the inuisible Deity: &amp; here
I cannot but be waile the great curse which hath befalne
man; for some there are, who in their studi
                  •
               s of
naturall Philosophy,Second causes do not detract from the first agent. haue had strange flashes of infidelity,
considering in the Meteors the causes of earthquakes,
thunders, lightnings, whirl-winds, tempests
and the like, together with the symptomes, signes, and
fore-runners, they begin to doubt of Gods prouidence,
whether these things befall vs as iudgements, or as naturall
effects; and how powerfull our prayers are, for
the hindering or hastning of such euents; as if the second
causes could subsist without their first mouers, that parents
could ingender without the concurrence of the
Sunne; Deus in sole te illuminat, in igne te calefacit, thou
takest the free vse of Gods creatures, but it is the power
of God in the creatures, and by the creatures that feeds
thee; the naturall causes doe not exclude Gods action,
but rather include it, who hath so ordained nature,
to worke his owne purpose: the prognosticall and vndoubted
signes doe argue a far greater prouidence of
God, who before the creation of the world, could so
dispose of nature, as that in his due time, hee might
worke his owne ends; thou seest these signes, and behouldest
his iudgements a far of; if thou shouldest pray,
thou wouldest thinke it a vaine thing, and heere is thy
error; though God workes by nature, and hath in some
sort tied himselfe, not to make any new creature, yet
God hath not so bound himselfe to worke only by nature,
but that sometimes he will interpose his own extraordinary
power, which is a prerogatiue inseparable
from the deity, otherwise there should be a far greater
certainty, in the whole course of naturall and iudiciall
Astrology. But suppose, that man knew Gods full resolution
and determinat will, yet are not the prayers of
the faithfull vneffectuall; for we are to pray for the fulfilling

of that will, fiat vol

giuen by the diuines, vt nos possimus capere quod ille praeparat
dare, that wee may not be found most vnworthy
of those blessings, which hee himselfe intends freely to
bestow: if with my prayers I could not preuent his
iudgements, yet my prayers would alter the nature of
those iudgements, from iudgements to be fatherly corrections
and chastisements; and would likewise inable
vs with patience and humility to beare our burthen, to
stay his leisure, and to expect our happie deliuerance.
            Others, considering the little change and alteration
of this world,There is a great difference between the birth of things, &amp; their continuance. doubt of Gods prouidence and his act of
creation; whether this world had any beginning: but
how vnfit are they to iudge of the creation, according
to the present condition of things in the same state,
wherein they now stand? for all their knowledge is borrowed
from the course of nature, and not from the
birth of nature; as if they should consider the riuer Nilus,
the streame, the bankes, the 
                  •
               bbing, the flowing,
yet in regard of the large circuit, passing thorough many
Prouinces and nations, they should neuer be able to
search out the spring or the fountaine: but doth not
reason informe them, that there must be a different condition
between the beginning of things and their continuance,
their preseruation, nourishment, and growth?
Man is not now daily fed, as hee was at first in the
wombe, there is not the like vse of the nauill, which at
this time seemes to be almost needles and vnprofitable,
and serues only to fasten the liuer and bowels; there is a
great difference between the hatching of egs, and the
keeping of chickens; least man should presume to iudge
of the creation, by the preseruation of nature, therfore
hath God taught in euery the least creature, a great disparity
between both.
            Surely to a right iudgement, Gods prouidence and

actions doe more manifestly appeare by the little and
small alteration in nature;Gods power doth wonderfully appeare in the continuance of the world. for I would gladly aske, if a
clocke or instrument of iron were made, which should
daily want mending, would ye commend the worke-man?
but suppose this clocke should continue for 
                  •
               any
yeeres perfect and sound, without reparation, then certainly
the work-man should haue his due praise &amp; commendation:
so is it in the frame of this world, which
hath now continued for many thousand yeeres without
alteration and change; and therefore therein Gods prouidence,
power, and protection, doth more eminently
appeare, then if God should daily creat new formes of
creatures, and should alter and change the present condition,
and state of this world, which he himselfe in his
great wisdome hath already contriued, supporting and
preseruing it by the same power, wherewith he created
it. For otherwise creatures should bee dissolued, the
earth should haue no stable foundation, amidst the ayre
and the waters; the whole world should reele and
tumble in the wast desarts of an infinit vacuum: and as
nature was made of nothing, so it should haue a power
to returne againe to the same nothing, as being the first
matrix or proper place, whereunto of it selfe, being left
to it selfe, it is naturally inclined: for it is a worke of as
great difficulty, and of as high excellency to preserue,
as at first to create, non minor est virtus quàm quaerere,
parta tueri, to establish and continue the gouernment,
is a worke of no lesse glory, then at first to obtaine the
conquest.

which hath befallen man in the point of his religion, a
curse of al other curses the greatest; that religion, which

is the sole comfort and solace of man,Mans greatest curse in the point of his religion. which erects our
hopes, and in the middest of misery giues vs true ioy of
heart, and peace of conscience; religion I say, which
proclaimes a new heauen and a new earth, consisting
only of happines; where Princes shall be without subiects,

Religion, religion (I say), through the diuersity of sects
of schismes, and of heresies, proceeding from the malignitie
and curse of mans nature, and from that first father
of enmity, qui super seminauit zizania, who will not
feare to approch euen to the highest pinnacles of the
temple; that religion (I say) should now at length disquiet
mens thoughts, molest their mindes, and almost
distract them; in so much that they know not which
way to take, but stand very doubtfull euen in the necessary
points of their saluation; Christ is become a
stumbling blocke, the truth of religion (by the corruption
of our nature) giuing occasion to the falshood of
religion, as in ancient times the sacrifice of beasts among
the Iewes, was an occasion of the idolatrous
worshipping of beasts among the Gentiles. Alas, how
many are perplexed with the variety, and diuersity of
sects, not knowing how to resolue themselues? whereas
in truth and verity, there can be no greater certainty or
infallibility, then in the immoueable foundations and
grounds of religion; if we shall detract from the wauering
vncertainty of our own fancies, and relie vpon the
diuine testimonies; the exposition and true meaning
whereof, by the daily practise of the Church, consent
of Fathers, verdit of counsailes, hath continually, visibly
and successiuely from Christ and his Apostles descended
to vs. O happy, happy, thrise happy are the beasts
of the field, that are exempted from all these differences!

I will from henceforth betake my selfe to the
woods, and the groues, and when I heare the chirping
birds sing, in stead of the communion of Saints, I will

            This difference in religion, I suppose to be shadowed
forth in the different and distinct sacrifices of Abell and
Caine,

the enmitie between both, as betweene the seed
of the woman, and the seed of the serpent: the truth of
religion, the more it is pleasing to God, the more it is
vnpleasing to man; in so much that no cruelty, torments,
or persecutions shall bee omitted in the cause of
religion. Abel the first that died or was slaine, suffered
martyrdome for religion, because his gift was acceptable
to God; he himselfe was more acceptable then his
gift, the one being accepted for the others sake, and
therefore he himselfe was to be offred vp in sacrifice, to
be the figure and type of him, who was the propitiato

things then the bloud of Abel, who as he was the head
of the Church, so opened he the way as to heauen, so to
tribulation and persecution, thorough which he ascended
vp to heauen; and if we looke to climbe thither, we
must passe the same way, there must bee some conformity
between the head and the members; and thus God
in his goodnes and secret wisdome permits, that his
vine-yard which his owne right hand hath planted, and
is bewatred with his owne blood, yet the wild-boare
out of the wood doth root it vp, and the wild beasts of

but now I will tell you a greater mischiefe, religion not

persecuted, which makes for her honor; but maskt, disguised
and counterfeited,The cloakes and pretenses of Religion. which discouers her shame.
For many there are, who colour all their sins and impieties
vnder the faire cloke of religion; thus not only our
soules and our consciences, our faith, our hope, our saluation;
but our liues, our bodies, our freedome, our
goods, and whatsoeuer els may concerne vs, all are subiect
to ship-wracke vnder this religious tempest. What
murthers, thefts, treasons, treacheries, gun-powder
plots, massacres, haue past among men for commendable
actions, vnder the vaile of religion? what breaking
of leagues among Princes, what dispensing with othes,
what alteration of gouernments, and last of all, what
infidelitie hath past between men, vnder the colour of
faith? Caesar, Tacitus, Macchi

all factions in religion, this is a monster newly hatched
in our dayes, in this last and worst age of the world; as
if the kingdome of grace did cleane ouer-throwe all
naturall rights; as if heauen could not subsist with the
earth; as if the Morall law, were together abrogated

greene, I may with great ease keepe it from festering;

heere I will giue thee some little tast of that,The Author makes a small digression. which
hereafter I may discouer more largely. For if it shall
please God, that together with our most happy forefathers
(the great Magi), I shall once safely arriue at

thorough places of darknesse and ignorance; and
in the middest of persecution, from thence I will returne
againe vnto Galile; where I will wait vpon him, and set
him before mine eyes to order my wayes, and my footsteps:
and if in any solemne feast, or great assembly I shal
leese him, then presently I will make inquisition, I will
goe backe againe to Ierusalem, where I wil make search
for him in the temple; and there vndoubtedly I shall
finde him, sitting in the middest of the Doctors, in medio
Doctorum, hauing his casting voyce, and directing
the Catholicke concent of many; let me not therefore
here preuent this happy occasion.
            Only in a word, the controuersies of religion assuredly
they are such, that if a man be of the least vnderstanding
(setting the feare of God before his own eyes,The controuersies of Religion.

Let it suffice, that the faith of the Church of England,
which heere we professe, was not framed yeasterday,
to serue the present turne and occasion, by new
vpstart and heathenish innouators; when as Clearkes
did seeme very learnedly to dispute, yet a secret close
policy did ouer-rule the conclusion; but such a faith as
all the Fathers imbraced, all the councels approued, all

the learned Diuines confirmed, in the Greeke Church,
in the Latin Church; which all the Martyrs haue sealed
with their bloud, al the Confessors witnessed with their
torments; a faith confirmed by so many miracles, taught
by the Apostles, first opened and reuealed by Christ,
qui erat splendor patris, who was a light to enlighten
the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Israel. This
faith was prefigured in the law, with sacrifices and types
fore-told by the Prophets, and shadowed forth in nature
by the vndoubted promises of God, semen mulieris
conteret serpentis caput: so that my faith and religion,
wherby I looke to be saued, was the faith and religion
of Adam, which I can deriue by a lineall descent
from age vnto age, shewing the expresse foot-steps, and
where the Church hath alwayes resided; like a hungry
dog thirsting after my saluation. I can follow the sent
and pursue the chase, from the first day of the worlds
birth, (for together with the creation of man, was the
end of mans creation, and the meanes to obtaine this
end, Truth is most ancient, as being of the nature of
God, and God himselfe is the ancient of dayes; and in
all our doubts of religion, wee must still flie to the first
institution, an sic fuit ab initio), vnto this present day,
being the 28. of February, in the yeere of our Lord
God 1615. dies dierum, the beginning of our septuagessima,
wherein wee remember the first fall of Adam,
and the birth of a sinner.
            For the controuersies in generall, some there are
which cannot bee reconciled; and for these wee will
mourne and lament, and daily beseech God for their
happy conuersion:There are seeming controuersies which may be reconciled. but I feare that a great part of the
dissention proceeds from our selues, who being now
setled in a peaceable Church, without persecution, the
truth of religion sufficiently appearing without any
great opposition of Turkes, of Iewes, or of Heathen,

hauing now gotten respit and ease, we do not so much
intend the actions of zeale and deuotion, as the point
of our learning, and the sufficiency of our knowledge;
which notwithstanding is not so proper and peculiar
to Priest-hood, as is the practise of Pietie, wherein consists
the height and perfection of a christian life; some
(I say) rather intending their studies then their prayers,
desiring to show the strength of their learning, they
must enter the combat of wits, and heere they must
seeme to dissent and to be irreconcileable; while closly
and vnder-hand, they send forth their agents, and
messengers to treate of a peace; and with a nice and
quaint distinction, can take vp the difference among
themselues, without shedding one drop of bloud; while
the world takes notice of their disagreement, and being
not able to iudge of their words of art, and the trickes
of their wit, still conceaues them to be at deadly enmitie.
I know not what to say of their learning, but I doe
much condemne their dishonesty, to make shew of
difference, when indeed there is none; and the schoole
learning it selfe, which makes all things disputable,
howsoeuer I do highly commend it, for wisdome, learning
and iudgement, yet I feare it hath not proued so
profitable and beneficiall to the Church; as hauing stird
vp those iars, which it could neuer asswage, like the action
of the moone in our bodies in respect of il humors;
for man is easily prouokt, but not so easily reconciled;
out of the frowardnes of our mindes, disputations doe
rather conceale, then open a truth; but it were to bee
wished rather, that the vulgar should neuer be acquainted
with the controuersies, then that thou shouldest
thinke to make them such perfect and good clearkes, as
that they might truely iudge of the differences: of

breach of christian charity, the difference not consisting
in any fundamentall, and essentiall point of religion,
but such as may well stand with the text of Scripture,
the three Creeds, all ancient councells, and the continuall
practise and tenent of the Church; so that herein
we shall not need to feare any shipwracke of faith, wee
shall not need to endanger our goods, our limbes, or

take any lust occasion of reproch: not only our catholik
reformed Churches, but euen the present Abbies and
Monasteries, now extant in other notiōs, haue bin much
reformed, since the dissolution of ours; they haue laid
open the maine strength, the rocke, the foundation, the
pillars of our Christian religion▪ so
                  •
               h at men neuer had
the like meanes, for the increase and strengthning of
their saith, as they haue at this day; the factions of each
partie doe kindle the heat of their zeale in their own
profession, and of their charity one towards another;
as the intollerable hate of one common foe, will knit
together a firme league of amity, which otherwise of it
selfe would easily dissolue.
            And therfore I will conclude, that the Church at this
present, inregard of the many differences, may fitly be

shadowed forth in Saint Peters calling,Saint Peters calling and reprehension. and in S. Peters
reprehension; Saint Peter who was called from fishing,
to be a fisher of men, let his net resemble the Church,
the conuersion and taking of soules: vpon the calling of
Saint Peter his net brake, but as the Diuines doe obserue,
it was to let in fish, and not to let out fish, and
so the euent proued accordingly: make I beseech you
the application; sometimes a schisme in the Church opens
a wider gap to saluation; that others may enter in,
who before d
                  ••
               st neuer approch for feare of the Cherubin,
which keepes the gate of Paradise with a fiery
sword, (that is) with fire, and with sword: Secondly,
Peters reprehension was, that when many came to apprehend
Christ, all of them were not his enemies, some
came to behold him, some to heare him, some to compassionat
him, while others betrayed and apprehended
him; yet Saint Peter, I will not iudge of his intention,
in the heat of his zeale drawes out his sword, which he
could not lawfully do, and strikes off the eare of Malchus:
the eare is the instrument of hearing, and betokens
the sole meanes of mans conuersion; but Christ
heales vp the wound, restores his eare, rebukes Peter
and threatens him; hee that drawes out the sword shall
perish by the sword, he that abuseth the sword, and often
prouokes the secular power, shall at length smart
by the sword, &amp;c.
            For the persecutions of the Church, it is no maruaile
though God doth permit them, seeing that Christian
religion inioyning man pena
                  •
               ce for his finne, seemes
to bee a kinde of persecution▪ such fastings,Persecutions of the Church. such weeping,
such mortificaton, such a strict and austere life,
that tyrannie itselfe could hardly impose a greater torment,
were it not, that Gods holy and sanctifying spirit
seemes to abate the sorrow; besides the promises of
God, and the conformity of this building, for the foundations

of the Church were laid in the bloud of Christ;
and therefore necessary it is, that in the rearing vp of the
walles and the roofe, the morter should likewise bee
tempered with the bloud of his Saints, and they appearing
in their own bloud, as it were clothed with scarlet,
should at length sit vpon thrones, iudging and condemning
the world of impiety.
            For the cloakes and pretenses of religion, what
should I say, the best things are soonest abused, and this
argues our corruption; if thou findest desperat attempts
couered with a religious habit?Pretenses of religion how they should instruct vs. then acknowledge in
thy selfe how powerfull religion should bee, for guiding
and directing thee in the whole course of thy life,
when a counterfeit shew of religion, shall moue others
to vndertake such dangerous and horrible cruelties, not
without the losse of their limbes, substance, life, the vtter
vndoing of poore widowes and orphants; the exposing
of themselues to all manner of tortures, fearefull to
the behoulders, and therfore much more terrible to the
offendors and malefactors, who suffer for their euill doing,
&amp;c. Whatsoeuer els may concerne religion, I shall
hereafter speake of it more largely to your further satisfaction.
            As man was corrupted, and all the creatures forsaking
their first and naturall vse, did serue for mans punishment,
and rebelled against him; so it stood with the
vniformitie of Gods iudgements,The generall deluge. that nothing should
remaine vntouched, no not the elements themselues,
being the first principles, seeds &amp; foundations of nature,
for as man was totally defaced, and had lost the image
of God, so this world though comming far short of
that most excellent state of Paradise, yet being Gods
owne immediat work-man-ship, and so still continuing,
God at length in his wisdome for our sins, thought
fit to deface it; and behold the rule of his iustice, when

as the children of God were mixt with the children of
men, God sends a deluge of waters to confound them
together. Death is the punishment of sin, that we might
heerein acknowledge Gods owne handy worke, the
iudgement fell from aboue, their graues were fashioned
in the clouds, and the elements did for a time change
their situation, and these were likewise confounded together:
and as in the creation the waters did flow vpon
the face of the earth; so now againe the whole world
did seeme to goe backward, and to returne to the first
nothing. Hence began a great alteration in nature, and
all things were changed to the worst; the earth did decay
in plenty and goodnes of fruits, for immediatly after
the deluge, God did enlarge Noahs-commission,
and gaue him free power to feed on the flesh of the
creatures;Losses sustained by the deluge. the water likewise lost her naturall propertie
of goodnesse, and therefore Noah immediatly began
to plant a vine-yard; the ayre was more subiect to
vapours, foggy mists, and darke clouds; the fire with hot

                  •
               umes and exhalations ascending and turning to
meteors, was made more imperfect and impure; the
heauens themselues haue not freely escaped, though
these sublunary contagions could not infect the stars,
yet were they able much to hinder the goodnes of their
actions and operations, as likewise to eclipse and obscure
their beauty; some of them neuer appearing vnto
vs, as are those stars in via lactea; others seeme twinckling,
titillantes, through the thicknesse, opacity, and
gloominesse of our ayre, not giuing passage to their
beames; and all of them appeare short in beauty, lesse
in quantitie then indeed they are, and assuredly are
much hindred in their operations.
            So that this generall deluge was indeed the generall
confusion of nature; and as it was the death of nature,
so nature her selfe could neither hinder nor hasten her

owne death; and being once fallen,The naturall meanes were not sufficient to cause a deluge. she could not raise
her selfe by her own naturall power, for howsoeuer the
God of nature might well vse naturall meanes (the watery
constellations) for the effecting of his good will
and purpose; yet surely these in themselues were not
sufficient, vnlesse you will thereunto adde Gods infinit
power, and his absolut authority; for certaine it is, that
there was the l
                  •
               ke coniunction of stars, within our memory,
in the yeeres 1524. and 1588. If we should suppose
that God did herein vse naturall meanes, they
might be numberlesse, as the power of God is infinit,
and his wisdome vnsearchable; yet such as reason &amp; the
schoole of Philosophy do most approue, are these: First,
that before the deluge the earth was more leuell, and
framed according to a better rule of a Globe or a Center,
and therfore the water might with more ease couer
the whole earth 15. cubits deepe; this being supposed,
there might follow a transmutation and change of elements
among themselues, where the earth might bee
turned into water, and carrie according to the rule of
Philosophy, decuplam proportionem, that euery ounce of
earth might bee turned into ten ounces of water; the
water likewise might bee summoned to appeare out of
the deepe, to change her scituation, to possesse the face
of the earth, according to her naturall course; the whole
element of water might bee ra
                  •
               ified, that it might take
vp a larger compasse, and still retayning her nature
might serue for our punishment; the bordering region
of the ayre, might be condensed and thickned, that it
might serue in stead of choking waters, and these might
be raised and puft vp with hot fumes, proceeding from
the bowels of the earth, which might make the boyling
or scalding seas to swell aboue measure. Thus infinit are
the wayes and meanes, which God might vse in this
deluge; I will here impose my selfe silence, rather trembling

at his iudgements, then presuming to search into
the depth of his counsailes.
            I do much more wonder at the staying of this deluge,
how the floud should cease, considering the nature of
water is to flow vpon the 
                  •
               ace of the earth▪ for vs to conceaue
that the sea is a sinke or a bottom,The wonder was greater in the ceasing of the floud. &amp; that the waters
are lower then the earth, it is much against reason,
which denies the water and earth to make one perfect
globe; much against common experience, when in the
highest parts of their ships they see furthest, and fi

               ugh I confesse, that the inequality
of the earth, is a speciall meanes to reduce all waters to
one proper place, yet I suppose, that the wonders of
God do manifestly appeare in euery element. First, in
the earth subsisting in a centre, like an immoueable
stocke, carrying the same distance to euery part of the
circumference; then the waters, notwithstanding their
roaring, their continuall and strange motion, wherein
they seeme to threaten the earth, yet are kept within
their owne bounds, not incompassed with a wall of iron
or brasse,The wonders of God in euery element. but with a border of sands, a weake bulwarke
(I confesse) were it not, that Gods power had first prescribed
the bounds; then followes the ayre, strangely
and miraculously supporting a weighty burthen of
clouds; at length we come to the fire, which being
kindled and preser

               ed by the swift and continuall motion
of the heauens, as it drawes nearer and nearer the
poles, so is it more and more lessened, and giues place
to the middle region of the ayre, which is therfore 
                  ••
               
               iled

                and
the sweet springs, to bewater their drie and scorehed
soyle.
            For the truth and certainty of this deluge, see how
God did dispose in his prouidence, that the Arke should

rest vpon the mountaines of Ararat, amongst which (as I
finde it reported) there are the highest mountaines in
the world, and the most in number; which was an vndoubted
argument,Proofes of the deluge from the resting of the Arke. that this floud did ouerwhelme the
whole earth: and likewise these mountaines were furthest
distant from the sea shoare, that so it might appeare
to after ages, and succeeding generations, finding
the reninant of this Arke, that the labour and industry
of man, neither would nor could transport the
Arke thither, but vpon sight thereof, they might acknowledge
and remember the great in-undation of
waters; for thus Nicholaus Damascenus, an heathen
man writeth, that in a generall deluge, one was carried
in an Arke, and rested vpon the top of these mountains,
whereon there continued a long time after, certaine
peeces and fragments of the Arke; and this might bee
the same, which Moses the Law-giuer of the Iewes
doth mention.
            Many signes and tokens doe likewise appeare in nature,
which as they are the reliques, so they serue as most
vndoubted arguments and proofes of the deluge;Reliques of the deluge in nature. at this
day there are found, both in other nations, and (as I am
informed) in the Ile of Man certaine trees, which serue
both for timber and fuell, in such plenty and quantity,
so many fadomes vnder the earth, as that by al probable
coniecture they were there buried and couered in the
time of the deluge; God foreseeing the wastfulnes
which man would commit in the spoyle of his woods,
like a prouident master of a family layes vp his store,
makes his prouision, and keepes his wood-yard safe
lockt and conceald, vntill a time of necessity; somtimes
likewise in the bottomes of seas and waters,Trees. where assuredly
according to the coast and situation of the
country, there hath bin alwayes a fluxe of waters, (supposing
the world in the state, wherin now the world

stands) yet therin there hath bin discouered foundations
of buildings,Buildings. which assuredly were ouerthrown in
the generall deluge; vpon the face of the earth I haue
obserued rockes and stones seeming to hang in the
ayre, without any circumiacent earth, whereas I did
conceaue in reason, that these hauing no certaine
growth, but only per iuxta positionem, &amp; agglutinationem,
               Rocks.
as the schooles speake, the bosome of the earth
was the fit wombe to ingender them; and standing thus
they did daily decay and decline, and therfore certainly
were not thus from the first creation, but the conflux of
waters hath vncouered them of earth, &amp; hath left them
there naked and bare, to be the immoueable markes of
the great deluge.
            When I consider the barrennesse of the earth for many
leagues together,Barrennesse. I cannot conceaue that it should
be thus from the beginning, being Gods owne immediat
workmanship, but that the salt waters haue caused
this barrennesse, and when I consider the strange different
mould of one and the same earth, as I haue often
obserued,The different mould. sand vpon clay, clay vpon grauel, grauel vpon
chalke, chalke vpon sand, &amp;c. Assuredly this diuersity
neuer was in the first creation, neither hath it since been
effected by any influence or operation of stars, but some
general ouerflowing of waters, hath caused this variety
of mould and complection;The veines of the earth. obserue how the goodnes
or barrennesse of grounds followes certaine veines of
the earth, not according to the coasts of the heauens,
from East to West, from South to North, least you
might ascribe it to the motion of the stars, but commonly
by a wreathed and crooked forme, that you
might rather ascribe it, to the current streames of the
waters; but let vs dig vp the barren soyles, and sometimes
we shall finde out marle-pits,Marle-pits. which do vndoubtedly
assure vs, that God hauing first created the earth,

gaue it a fatnes in the vpper crust thereof, but in the
great in-undation of waters, being spread and couered
ouer with sand, it is now baked and growne to a kinde
of ripenes and melownes; so that (man vsing his labour
and industrie) God hath now ordained it, to bee the
compost of the earth, to supply the barennesse of nature,
in this last and old age of the world:Cole-pits. let vs yet dig deeper,
and happily we may come to some cole-pits, which
consist of the oylie &amp; vnctuous substance of the earth,
which is laid and buried so deepe by the ouerflowing
of waters, in the time of the deluge, as not being able
to supply 
                  •
               ap for the root of trees (whereunto it was first
ordained by nature) it gathers it selfe to it selfe, and hauing
a long time of concoction, without any great annoyance
of waterie sappe, God hath ordained it, as a
fit subiect for fuell, which in these last dayes, (our wood
fayling, especially in these colde Northerne countries)
God hath very plentifully discouered; and that which
giues credit to this truth, I haue obserued this in the
cole-pits, that where there hath been a moderate fall,
and descent of water, there the cole hath been much
weightier, brighter, and better; as for mettals there is
not the like reason in them, for assuredly they follow
the course of the heauens, as they are framed by a speciall
influence of Starres; wherein appeares the goodnesse
of God, that in so painefull and such a dangerous
worke, poore man might obserue a greater certaintie
in his labours.
            I suppose likewise, that the vn-euennes of the earth
(the hils and the vales) were much caused by this generall
deluge; for ye shall obserue, that the highest mountaines
vpon earth, carrie some proportion to the lowest
bottome at Sea:Mountaines are shelues, vallies are the channels. for as the greatest height is supposed
to be sixe and twentie or seuen and twentie miles
vpright, so is the greatest deapth, that God might obserue

some kinde of proportion in the inequalitie, seeing
that both earth and water should make one perfect
globe, (thus the fish of the Sea resemble in feature and

                  •
               orme the beasts of the field, that so thou mightest acknowledge
the same prouidence of God in both); for
certaine it is, that all the terrible tokens, and signes of
Gods anger and wrath, did accompanie the deluge; and
as the waters did swell aboue measure, so the billowes
and waues of the Sea did arise in a wonderfull and
fearefull manner; and these (surely) might well cause a
great inequalitie in the earth; and therefore you shall
obserue, that the hilles stand not alone, but are contiguous
and adioyning together, as it were shelues raised
vp with the waues, and carried with the streame;
that it might appeare, that God in the middest of
iudgement, remembreth mercy; for euen these hilles
did serue as a speciall meanes (by Gods owne appoyntment)
to allay the raging of the waters; and againe to
gather them into one common storehouse, where
they might bee hedged, and kept within their ow
                  •
               e
boundes.
            The truth of this deluge to the Iewes and the Christians,Proofes amongst the Iewes. is sufficiently warranted by the diuine testimonie,
which is beyond all exception. Wee are likewise
able to trace the continued succession of times, the discent
of tribes and families from Noah and his Sonnes,
as likewise the plantation of nations, the establishing
of kingdomes and gouernments; so that nothing is defectiue
in this kinde, to him that hath made but a small
entrance in the studie of Chronologie; as likewise the
attempts of men soone after the deluge, for preuenting
the like in-undation, as namely the building of Babell,
&amp;c. many things as yet appeare in their lawes and
their customes; especially places (reserued for keeping
of their auncient recordes) so built, as that they might

be free from the annoyance of waters.
            For the Gentiles, their Philosophers considering
that the world was vpheld by opposition and combate
of elements, and that the elements were not equally
matched, but doe fight vpon disaduantage; for two of
them are actiue and two passiue, the actiue qualities
farre exceeding the passiue in vertue, power and operation;
hereby they did conceiue that there might be an
ouerthrow and dissolution in nature, either by water or
fire, which were therefore not improperly called the
dreadfull and destroying elements; whereby the opinion
concerning the generall deluge, was made the
more credible, which deluge was known vnto them by
the name of Ogiges or Deucalions floud: not, but that I
acknowledge there was a floud which happened in the
time of Ogiges, and another in the time of Deucalion;
but assuredly such things are reported of these two
flouds, which could not be competent or agreeable, but
onely to the vniuersall deluge; and therefore I suppose
that the deluge was called by the name of Ogiges or
Deucalions floud, because these gaue occasion, and did
rippe vp and renew the memorie thereof; this I conceiue,
because certaine it is, that Noah was called among
the Gentiles, the first Ogiges, speaking of the
floud which happened, sub prisco Ogige, and things
which were past remembrance were called Ogigia;
               Testimonies of the Gentiles concerning the deluge.
this deluge is likewise mentioned, by diuers most auncient
heathen writers, as by Berosus Chaldaeus, Hieronimus
Aegyptius, Nicholaus Damascenus, Abydenus and
others, according as both Iosephus and Eusebius doe
proue; Plato in Timaeo, seemes to remember it; and Berosus,
who was the most auncient writer among the
heathen, beginnes his historie from the floud in these
words: Ante aquarum cladem famosam, qua vniuersus
perijt orbis, &amp;c. beyond which course of time no historie,

no author, no monument is extant; and that you
may not thinke, that this truth was fastened vpon the
ancients, or that their workes should heerein admit a
fauourable construction; the Heathen and Pagans at
this day in Bresill, and other countries of the West-Indies,
lately discouered in our age, where neuer any
Christian professors were knowne to teach; yet they
talke of the drowning of the world, which happened in
times past; and they say, that this was left vnto them by
tradition, time out of minde, by the inhabitants of those
places.
            But why doe I thus trouble my 
                  ••
               lfe with the deluge?
behold I see a waterie signe in the cloudes, containing
in it selfe a great varietie of glittering colours,
as it were resembling the beautie of Nature, which by
a speciall indulgence of God, shall preserue vs from the
like in-undation of waters.Of the Rainebow. It proceeds (I confesse) from
waterie and naturall causes, and was before the deluge;
but not as a sacramentall signe, or the earnest of Gods
promise and couenant: for th

                  〈◊〉
                is a ring▪ before it
becomes a mariage ring, as things which consist in relation,
first presuppose an entitie in themselues. Behold
(I say) here is a bow; but here is our comfort, an emptie
and a naked bow: Where is the shaft? it is alreadie
shot, and spent; wee shall neuer neede to feare any further
danger by this bow; for to my sight, and to my vnderstanding,
it is rather bent against heauē, then against
earth. I pray' obserue it aright; it should seeme that
God hath so disposed it, that it might serue rather as a
memoriall for God, to put him in mind of his promise,
then as a terrour to man, to strike vs with feare of Gods
vengeance. And therefore this bow shall serue as a
bridge, as a bow-bridge, by which I will passe ouer this
great in-undation of waters, humbly praising and magnifying
God, that as the old world was ouerwhelmed by

waters; so God in his mercie hath appointed, that there
should be a regeneration by waters, that the old Adam
being washed and cleansed from sinne, we might be receiued
into the arke of Christs Church, through the sanctifying
waters of the holy stood of Iordan.
            
            Hauing spoken of the first ouerthrow of the world
by waters, I cannot but in a word, (for similitude of argument,
though otherwise the iudgements shall bee
wrought by different and contrary meanes), speake of
the second ouerthrow, which shall be by fire, in a generall
combustion. Behold then, the earnest of this last
iudgement, when as Sodom and Gomorrha were consumed
with fire from heauen, that it might serue for euer
as a remarkable token,The burning of Sodom and Gomorrha is an earnest of the last generall combustion. or the first beginning of a
general combustion, which threatens the whole world.
Vnto this day the place is vnhabitable, fire and brimstone
hauing left such a strong sent, as might well argue
the strange ebullition of their vnnaturall lust: and as it
was a lust, which did not intend generation; so was it
the most vnnaturall act, without any president or example
of the bruite beasts, for none of them are tainted
with such vncleannesse. And therfore (behold) their punishment,
carries a proportion and correspondencie to
the offence: whereas they should haue intended by an
orderly course of nature, the preseruation of their seed,
in the fruites of their loynes; the propagation of their
kinde, and the continuance of their names and memories;
themselues taking a cleane contrarie course, &amp;c.
(the remembrance hereof is most hatefull, detestable,
and abominable to euery chaste and Christian minde).
Therefore by the iust iudgements of God, these Cities
were turned, by their destruction, into a strange lake;
which vnto this day, is knowne by the name of mare
mortuum, the dead Sea, wherein nothing can liue: for
proofe and certaintie whereof, as trauellers at this time

can testifie as much, so many Gentiles, Heathen and forraine
writers doe witnesse the same truth; as Galen,
Pausanias, Solinus, Tacitus, and Strabo, all of them testifying
and shewing the particular wonders thereof.
            But you will say, that this iudgement is only proper
and priuate to the inhabitants of those parts; and that
little trust or credit is to bee giuen to trauellers in this
kinde:Thunder and lightning, tokens of the last combustion. though herein I could easily conuince you, for
things shall speake for themselues, and in euery nation,
there are many eye-witnesses of this truth; yet behold,
for your further satisfaction, in the darke and thicke
cloudes, how the thunder and lightnings are together
encompassed, as if wee could not separate these iudgements,
but that the one did carrie and portend the other,
and (as it were) giue place to the other. For when
the Sunne shall haue gathered out of the bowels of the
earth, a sulfureous matter, fit and apt for combustion; as
much in effect, as if I should say, when our iniquities are
come to a full height, and ripenesse, and that our sinnes
are climed vp to heauen, and there crie for vengeance,
cum calles obdurârint; then behold, he that sits vpon the
cloudes, doth together send foorth a lightning and a
thunder, for the decrees of God are inseparable, though
there may be degrees in their execution. First the lightning
astonisheth vs, like an admonition, or preparatiue
to the subsequent iudgement, ac si dicat ca

                  e, ne te fulmen
interimat; then followes the iudgement, which
is vnresistable. Now if you please to consider this thunder
and lightning as tokens and forerunners of the last
generall combustion; you shall finde the one a figure of
the other, and very fitly to resemble it, by way of comparison.
            But how am I falne at length, to speake of water and
fire? as if the Deluge, or the burning of Sodom, could

betoken the generall fall and corruption; when as (in
deed) they were the particular punishments of actuall
sinnes,The author recalles himselfe. proper and peculiar to the place, to the times, to
the persons: vnlesse what hath befalne them, might
serue as threatnings to vs; and that the whole nature
in generall cannot be excused from that, which hath befallen
any one in particular: but I will not stand to iustifie
my selfe; indeed I was carried with the course and
streame of the times, considering things as they fell
out, according to their seuerall accidencies. If herein I
haue erred, it is no great marueile, for behold my
tongue is confounded, my tongue is confounded: and
therefore in the next place, I will come to the next generall
iudgement, which concernes whole mankinde,
namely the confusion of tongues.
            
                Genes. 11. vers. 7. Come on,
               The confusion of tongues. 
               let vs goe downe, and there
confound their language, that euery one perceiue not anothers
speech, &amp;c. This confusion of tongues first began
at Babell, and is now generally spread ouer the face of
the whole world: common and daily experience can
witnesse the truth of the successe, and the diuine testimonie
shewes the first originall. Eusebius likewise citeth
at large the testimonies both of Abydenus, who liued
about King Alexander time, and of Sibylla, as also
the words of Hestieus, concerning the land of Senaar,
where it was builded: and these Gentiles doe shew by
reason, that if there had not been some such miracle in
the diuision of tongues; no doubt but that all tongues
being deriued of one (as all men are descended of one
father) the same tongues would haue retained the same
rootes, and principles, as in all dialects or deriuation of
tongues, we see that it commeth to passe: but now (say
they) in many tongues, at this day, wee see that there is
no likelihood or affinity among thē, but are al different
the one from the other: and thereby it appeareth, that

they were made diuers and distinct by some speciall
miracle.
            Herein the iustice of God appeares, that seeing man
desired to continue his owne memorie, by the workes
of his owne hands, without any reference to the diuine
power; therefore God confoundeth their tongues,How agreeable the punishmēt was to the offence. that
their speech and their language might faile them, to
record their owne acts: and that they might neuer bee
able to conspire or take counsell together; when the
one calles vp for timber, the other breakes his backe in
carrying vp stones; one calles for his instruments and
tooles, but another brings morter to stop his mouth:
thus euery man either suspecteth himselfe to bee in a
dreame or else accuseth all others of madnesse and follie;
and thus there is a dumbe silence of pratling creatures,
there is a noyse or a sound without sense or signification,
for want of one knowne and common tongue
to interpret. Thus the punishment was agreeable to the
diuine iustice, and very conformable to mans present
state and condition: for whereas our mindes are distracted
with varietie of opinions,The punishment is agreeable to mans condition. and our hearts carried
headlong to diuers inordinate lusts; so the tongue
should likewise bee confounded with many base and
barbarous languages, some of them very harsh in pronunciation,
that a man must wrong his owne visage,
and disfigure himselfe to speake them: others without
grauitie or wisdome in their first imposition, consisting
only of many bare, and simple tearmes, not reduced to
any certaine fountaines, or heads, which best resembleth
nature: Many of them hindring mans thoughts,
and wanting a sufficiēt plentie of words, cannot significantly
expresse the quicknes of inuention▪ or liuelily
expresse an action: some giuing way to fallacies and
sophistrie, through Tautologies, ambiguous words,
darke sentences; others inclining to ribaldrie, and luxurious

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉

speech: all of them daily inlarged, and refined, as
hauing not yet attained any perfection, but still requiring
the helpe of the pencill; insomuch that within the
compasse of a few yeeres, you shall not know them to
be the same languages. Thus is man no counterfeit, for
he is inwardly, and outwardly, totally confounded.
            For the large extent of this punishment, it may well
appeare by a due consideration, either of place, or time.
For all nations in the world seeme more to be diuided
with tongues,The extent of this punishment. then with seas, with riuers, with bankes,
or with gouernments; and in the same tongue you shal
obserue a great diuersitie of dialects, the Grecians
speake diuersly their owne language, Attice, Ionice,
Dorice. Take this one kingdome, and you shall finde
that Seuerne &amp; Trent do moysten the seuerall tongues
of our people, and make a great difference, in one and
the same language; notwithstanding the pr
                  •
               eminency
of the one aboue the other, yet the meanest will not
conforme it selfe to the best: the Welsh suppose their
owne tongue to be as honourable, in regard of the antiquitie,
as the English doe daily seeme curious in filing
and refiling of theirs. Now in the succession of times it
appeares, that all the ancient languages, which indeede
were ye fittest caskets to containe ye Iewels of mysteries,
haue already failed, either in the vse and speech of men,
as the Hebrew, Greeke, Latin, Syriacke, Chaldaick, &amp;c.
or else are wholly extinct, and abolished. As heere in
England, the Saxon tongue; and the language of the
Picts in Italy; what tongues the Gothes and Vandols
did speake: and he that shall peruse our English Chaucer,
shall finde more difficultie in his words, then in his
sense. And thus the confusion of tongues serues to bereaue
vs of each others helpe; we cannot partake with
other nations in their counsell and experience. Our
owne forefathers committing their workes to writings,

they seeme aliens and strangers vnto vs; we cannot
vnderstand them, without the vse of Dictionaries,
and Commentaries.
            To let passe, how nations haue issued out of nations,
and all men descended from one, whereby they might
retaine the same speech and language,The strangenes of this iudgement. for the learning
and perfection of the reasonable soule; as they doe the
like foode for preseruation of their bodies, and the same
seede for propagation of their kind. But for this varietie
of tongues, I would gladly aske, Doe not all other
creatures of the same kinde, agree in one and the same
language of nature, wherby they testifie to each other,
either their ioy, or their sorrow? Haue not many birds
as much varietie in their notes and tunes, and yet all are
the same in the same kinde; as there are words and syllables
which passe betweene men? I pray', doth it not
appeare, in all other workes of nature, that the inward
forme doth naturally of her selfe discouer her selfe, by
some outward propertie? and why should not the reasonable
soule make her selfe knowne by a naturall
speech and language, that wee might see the inward
man as well as the outward feature? for speech is the only
companion, and witnesse of reason.
            Consider the instruments of speech, the throate, the
tongue, the teeth,The strangenes appea
                     •
                  es by way of comparison. the lips, and the pallat; are they not
the same, and alike in all men? Is not the ayre and
breath the same, which frames the sound of this voyce?
Take all instruments of musicke, and being fashioned
alike, you shal find a like sound, they consist of a meane,
a treble, a tenour, a base, &amp;c. they haue so many strings,
so many stops, they giue the same musicke; that is, the
same language in effect, though the lessons doe varie,
that is, the difference consists in the diuersitie of their
speech, or their conference. Are there not many naturall
notes, which are alike common to all languages?

(our laughter, our sighing, our sobbing, our sneesing);
cā the passions of the bodie thus naturally discouer thē
               selues▪
and yet cannot the minde naturally disclose her
owne secrets? Is there any thing so proper and peculiar
to man, as societie and fellowship; and yet for want of
one common language, the kind cannot conuerse with
it selfe? and yet you may obserue in all languages, how
there is a necessitie of the same alphabet; for there are
but fiue vowels, and more or lesse there cannot bee,
which proceedes from the opening or contraction of
the mouth: will Nature lay the foundation, and yet
God in his wisedome forbid to finish this building?
then is it euident, that contrarie to the first intent of nature,
wee are changed and altered by sinne; God confounding
our tongues, brings our workes to confusion.
            But (I pray') consider the occasions which might serue

                  •
               or the retaining of the same language: Are not all men
deriued from the loines of one,Meanes to retaine the same language. and the same man? haue
not nations issued foorth out of nations? and is it possible,
that they should retaine the same seede, remember
their beginnings, obserue the same rites, customes
and manners, and yet forget their owne language? In
Pembroke-shire certaine Dutch-men being anciently
permitted to inhabit, their posteritie vnto this day retaines
the luxurie and riot (proper to that nation), and
yet they haue forgotten their language. Thus the
tongue serues to be instrumentum gustus &amp; loquelae,
the instrument of taste, the instrument of speech; the
one she stil practiseth, the other she hath cleane forgotten;
and in both you may acknowledge the corruption
of mans nature, and the iust punishment of mans
sinne.
            If our beginning bee forgotten, and that wee haue
learned a strange language; yet (me thinkes) the noble

and braue conquest of Princes,The Monarchies and conquests. especially the great Monarchs
of the world, should haue reduced all things; as
to the vniformitie of gouernment, so to the vniformitie
of tongues: that all being ruled and guided by one law,
hauing recourse to the Emperours court, doing their
homage and seruice to his person; this might be an excellent
meanes to auoyd barbarisme, and to re-unite the
tongues of men in one speech, as the bodies of men are
knit together vnder one yoake of subiection. But all
will not serue against the diuine prouidence, for he confounded
their tongues, who hath likewise confounded
their Monarchies; sooner you may suppresse a state, and
put them all to the sword; then that you can bridle their
mouthes, bring them to schoole, and teach them a new
tongue.
            If the sword cannot preuaile, yet (me thinkes) the necessity
of trading,The necessity of trading and commerce. and commerce should inforce a necessity
of the same language: especially considering that
there are certaine fruits proper to nations; and as their
soyle yeelds them, as their country affoords them, so
the inhabitants first impose the name, and this name
should accompany the fruits, and be together transported
to those nations, to whom these fruits are imparted;
for (assuredly,) the name would no way increase the burthen,
or price of the commodities: but it should seeme,
that together with the change of our windes, and our
sailes in the passage, we must alter these names; or els
we haue forgotten the ould names, and remembring
only the v
                  •
               e and valuation, we do well hope, that a new
name may make a new price; supposing that it lies in
our power, being now masters of the commoditie, to
giue it a name at our pleasure, and thus you see the confusion
of tongues.
            But of all other meanes to reduce the world to one
language, (me thinks) the greatest consists either in the

necessity of the same lawes,The vniformity of lawes and of religion. which in ancient times haue
gouerned the whole world; or els from the vniformity
and concent of religion, which vnites and knits together
the hearts of all men in one league of faith, the
tongues of all men in one confession of faith, the actions
of all men in one seruice of faith, and in the same bonds
of charity and deuotion. So that there is notwithstanding
the separation of persons, time, and place, a perfect
communion of Gods Saints. If generall councells
should meete and assemble together, necessary it is, that
they should confer in one common language, concerning
such things as may generally tend to the good of
the whole Church; or if we should be inforced to trauell,
it were to be wisht that we might not be destitute
of the meanes for our soules health, but that wee might
bee fit to ioyne with all congregations in prayer; yet
God forbid, that wee should pray in an vnknowne
tongue, which in effect were, to offer vp vnto God, the
calues of our lips (vitulos labiorū
               ), without the burning
incense of the heart, which should set on fire the sacrifice,
and make it acceptable; and heere you may well
obserue the curse of God in the confusion of tongues.
            This punishment doth not only argue how tongues
are confounded among themselues, that from one naturall
and instrumentall tongue,The punishment appeares not only in the variety of tongues, but likewise in the distraction. there should proceed infinit
notes and numberlesse tongues and languages; but
likewise how the tongues are distracted, from all other
mans faculties; how hard it is, to keepe the heart and
the tongue in an equal pace, that neither of them should
run before, and leaue the other behind it: in our dearest
prayers, doth not the mouth run ouer the seruice,
when the heart is wandring in the fields about our ordinary
vocation, and sometimes is stained with vncleane
thoughts? hath not the tongue learned her lesson without
booke, speakes like a Parrat, and seemes to excuse

mans negligence, and to conspire with the world and
the flesh, for the couering and concealing of sinne; that
without a first mouer, without the hearts direction or
consent, she is able to play her owne part, and to set a
difference between the outward and the inward man in
one and the same person.
            Suppose the heart and the tongue should ioyne their
forces together, and both labour and ioyne in one action;
yet what a difficulty appeares in respect of the subiect,A difficulty for a man to expresse his own thoughts.
as if they could not discouer their own inuentions
or notions? how hard is it to describe an action to the
full life? there must be as great wisdome and policie in
the relation, as there was in the first assault and attempt;
there must be the same spirit, life, courage and resolution:
heere you shall finde words of defiance, as it were
spit out in bloud; anon nothing but mildenes and
tearmes of compassion: now to temper and square out
a speech for men of all sorts, of all degrees, vpon all occasions,
it is a very high point of wisdome; and therfore
the Historian deserues great commendation, almost as
much as the actors; and it were to be wished, that hee
which holds vp his speare, should at length take vp his
pen, and describe his own acts: Caesar hath written
Commentaries, Cominaeus the actions of his master, Tacitus
the gouernment of the Romans, and Machiauel
the state of the Florentins: if difficulty appeares in the
relation, if the most naturall action of man, his speech
be troublesome or defectiue; acknowledge the curse of
man, in the confusion of tongues.
            Especially I conceaue, that it is a great difficulty for a
wiseman to expresse his own meaning,A wise man can hardly be a good speaker. conceiuing all in
an instant, after an angelical manner; for him to descend
lower then himselfe, and cutting out his meaning by
peeces, to square it by the rules of a method, to the meanest
capacity; neither his patience will permit him, nor

the height of his vnderstanding eleuated aboue the vulgar
reach, can admit such a down-fall: in so much that
you shall find few of the wisest men, to haue the best vtterance
and deliuery. Againe, multitudes of words betokens
a great want of substance, and therfore desires to
make recompence with leaues, for want of the fruit and
kernell of vnderstanding; for assuredly the greatest
number and multiplying of words, argues the least
weight and poyse in the substance. But dumbe beasts
are not therfore dumbe beasts, because they are not
heard, for their sound and noyse is far greater then ours;
but they are therfore dumbe beasts, because they spake
not distinctly to our vnderstanding: and so many men
and many woemen may bee called dumbe, notwithstanding
their verbositie and multitudes of words. The
sweetnes of musicke appeares as well in the pause, the
respit and keeping of time; as in the notes, the tune, or
the voyce: sometimes a silence is as fit, and as commendable
in man, as at other times his speech, or his vtterance.
            How great a part of our age is taken vp in learning
of languages, from ten to twenty, from twenty to thirtie,The difficulty in learning tongues.
scarce the whole life of man will suffice? In all our
Vniuersities, you shall finde the Greeke and Hebrew
professors, to be the most ancient and the most painefull
students; and yet they teach nothing in effect, but only
the bare language: how many Grammars, what infinit
rules, what dictionaries, and phrases of speech are required
for the helpe of our studies? Grammar is the entrance,
which leades to the mart of all sciences; if thou
mistakest thy selfe in the entrance, thou shalt greatly
wander in the whole course of thy trauell: suppose thou
hast laid a good foundation, and hast proued an excellent
Grammarian; yet their seems to be a kind of opposition
between the studie of nature, and the knowledge

of tongues: the one grounding it selfe, vpon the setled
foundation of a good memory, the other quickned by
the speedy discourse and apprehension of a ripe and forward
wit:Defects in Grammar. neither do tongues follow the order and
course of nature, for in many things which nature hath
rankt in one kinde, and giuen them the same properties,
yet in grammar you shall find them infinitly to differ in
their genders, their numbers, declensions; wheras indeed
there should bee some kind of affinity between
Logick and Grammar, the one directing his vnderstanding,
the other framing his speech, and both of them
should ranke things in serie praedicamentali: as things
are ioyned or differ in nature, so they should obserue
the like agreement or distance in mans conceit or vtterance;
and yet the art it selfe is to be excused, loquendum
vt vulgus, such was the necessity of Grammar, that it
proceeded not by degrees like other arts, not cannot
admit a reformation, as being promiscuously dispersed
through the mouths of the multitude; yet such hath bin
the painfull attempts of the learned, that heerein they
haue left nothing vndone, which might make for the
perfection of the art.
            The greatest confusion (in my iudgement) doth herein
especially appeare, when the parts do wilfully and
maliciously oppose each other: that notwithstanding
the hearts priuitie and knowledge,Periury and lying proceed from this confusion. together with the
inward and vndoubted testimony of his own conscience;
yet the tongue and the outward man shall sweare
and depose the contrary: and therein shall take God to
be the witnesse of falshood, as if they did desire God to
alter and change his owne nature, rather then these
miscreants will conforme themselues to the truth of his
nature. Here you see the corruption of man in the confusion
of tongues, heere is the height and top of all misery;
now as steps and degrees hereunto, are lying, equiuocation,

mentall reseruatiō, ambiguous, doubtful and
darke speeches; all which haue their degrees of accesse
vnto periurie, according to substance or circumstance.
And hence it is, that the casuist Diuine desiring truth,
and nothing but truth, obligeth the conscience, and inforceth
the speaker, to speake according to the vnderstanding
of another, and not of himselfe; so that he must
be inwardly perswaded in his owne conscience, that
the other did conceiue him, in the same manner, as hee
himselfe vnderstood his owne words; otherwise at the
barre of his conscience hee shall be iustly condemned
for falsehood and lying.
            To leaue the great and crying sinne of periurie, it
stood with the iustice of God (the heart and the tongue
being thus diuided) to set a difference betweene the
eare and the vnderstanding:The very tongues doe sometimes obscure and hinder our knowledge. that as man deales with
God, and deales with man deceitfully; so God frames
out his iustice according to measure and rule, that man
might bewaile his owne punishment, for committing
the like offence; for assuredly many tongues doe much
hinder the diligent search of the truth. It were to bee
wished, that we might speake the language of Adam,
where names were imposed according to the nature of
things; but now it should seeme, there is a great difference,
for the most pleasing speech adorned with Metaphors,
and Figures, is not the fittest for the discouerie
of a truth: and on the contrarie, all the schoole learning,
which indeed is the very touch-stone of all truth,
and in it selfe is most wise, and farre transcending the
ordinarie capacitie, yet suffers the shamelesse and malicious
reproch of barbarisme, for want of the elegancie
of stile; and all the first parents and authors thereof,
who indeed were the lights and lampes of all true learning,
as Lumbard, Sanctus Thomas, Scotus, Occam, yet
are contemned and neglected by this poeticall and

phantasticall age, which delights more in words then
in substance.
            To giue an euident proofe of this confusion of
tongues, how plentifull are the schooles, and how doe
they abound with multitudes of distinctions? all answers
must end with distinctions, which assuredly wel
argueth, that if the branches must necessarily be diuided,
to serue the present turne and occasion, yet still the
roote is confounded: a great iudgement of God, that
man hauing forsaken the first fruite, and hauing associated
himselfe to the beasts of the field; therfore he proues
a stranger to himselfe, to his brethren, and forgets his
owne mother tongue.Whether man should speake naturally Hebrew. Indeede I haue heard it reported
by authors, that if a man were taught no other language,
then hee should speake Hebrew, the same language
which Adam spake in the beginning: but I
should as easily beleeue, that if a man wanted all possible
meanes to sustaine life, that then hee should instantly
recouer Ierusalem, from the hands of the Turks,
and that God should there call all the tribes together,
or raise vp Adam, there to conuerse and talke with him
in the Hebrew tongue; as that he should speake naturally
Hebrew, for the curse was generall in the confusion
of tongues: though speech be proper and naturall
to man, yet this, or that language, followes the franke
and free imposition of man, and hath no ground-work
in nature.
            That which gaue occasion to this opinion, was this,
what language men should speake in Paradise, or after
the last resurrection, supposing that language to bee
naturall to man; and certainly of all the to
                  •
               gues extant,
Hebrew is the likeliest,Whether we shall speake Hebrew after the last resurrection. for it was of Gods owne imposition
and framing, before sinne had defiled man; it contained
the greatest and highest mysteries, and of all other
tongues, seemes to bee the fittest arke to containe

them▪ Christ and his Apostles were Hebrewes, first sent
to the Iewes, and then to the Gentiles. Vpon the Crosse
Christ vsed his owne tongue, Eloi eloi lamasabacthani,
notwithstanding the tongue was vnknowne to the
souldiers. And in the Apocalyps, although the booke
was first written in Greeke, yet the Angels song in heauen
is there recorded in Hebrew: but when I consider,
that man shall haue a higher state, then was the state of
Paradise, and that his bodie shall be much more spirituall,
and his vnderstanding more illuminated, then euer
before; for we shall then be like the Angels of heauen,
who speake to each other, by directing the edge of
their vnderstanding to each other, as it were opening
the glasses, and casting foorth a light to each other:
Considering (I say) the different condition of renewing
to a better state, and continuance in the same state, they
must pardon me, if I doe not affirme this, as an vndoubted
truth in mine owne priuate opinion.
            From this diuersitie and varietie of tongues, you
shall obserue a great disorder both in the State and in
the Church; whence proceedes the enmitie betweene
nations,The inconueniences proceeding from this confusion of tongues. and the first occasion of reproch? where doe
they first begin to discouer themselues, but onely from
the diuersitie of the garbe and the language? To see a
poore Northerne man, with his gaping &amp; wide mouth
vsing his broad and flat speech, brought vpō the stage,
heere is a subiect of laughter for the multitude: but I
feare, that this hate and enmitie betweene nations, doth
nourish and adde fuell to the hot strife and contention
of the Church, in the point of her controuersies; or at
least I may truly say, that infinite are the contentions of
the Church about words; all which proceed from that
curse of man, the confusion of tongues; which we cannot
auoide, but seeme rather daily to increase our own
shame: we fight about shadowes, wee contend about

words; many doubts in Christian religion seeme to be
grounded vpon the signification of words, and tearmes
of art; how many Sacraments hath Christ ordained in
his Church? a question of words: doe Sacraments conferre
grace, ex opere operato? a question of words; is
honour due to the Saints? a question of words, and such
like infinite questions.
            Sometimes in the very exposition, or interpretation
of words, being simple and first notions, (as the schoole
speakes) and no tearmes of art: there are many &amp; great
controuersies in Christian religion, whether Christ in
his sole and humane nature did really and truly descend
into hell;Great controuersies about words. if wee could agree vpon the exposition
of the word, it would sufficiently resolue the controuersie:
or will you see an infernal state here vpon earth,
whether presbyteri should signifie lay elders, or not; it
hath been much disputed by some men, whose zeale is
not according to knowledge. Thus the holy Ghost being
the pen 
                  •
                mā of Scripture, giuing the stile, the words,
the method, as well as the sense: if any one of these be
altered or changed, it loseth the strēgth of the Canon;
and therefore he that shall take vpon him to interpret
Scripture, doth only giue his owne exposition of Scripture;
which exposition being priuate and proper to
himselfe, I will regard it no more, then the opinion of
one priuate man; so that, if in my reading of the Fathers,
I shall obserue some generall agreement, together
with their learned iudgements, though Scripture
be not instantly quoted to that purpose, yet I will respect
it as much, as I will the Geneua translation. Lest
other professions should thinke much of our iarres, I
will therefore in the second place instance in the wisedome
of the Law: what infinite suites are daily commenced,
when as the whole doubt ariseth from the extent
and signification of words? A Lordship hauing

faire demaines, a beautifull house, many tenants, great
seruices and homage, sold at a valuable price; yet now
recald againe, ca
                  •
               t vpon the heire at common law for
want of sufficient words to conuay it.
            As I haue remembred the iust punishment for our
sinnes, so giue me leaue in thankefulnesse of minde to
consider Gods prouidence, in this our confusion of
tongues.Gods mercie in the vnion of these kingdomes of England and Scotland. And that especially to vs, for God in his mercy
intending to vnite and knit together these 2. kingdomes
of England, and Scotland: Hee so ordained it
from the beginning of the world, that (like twins) they
should both speake one tongue, and one language; vntill
in his due time hee should giue the promised Land
to Iacob, and to his posterity for euer. Notwithstanding
that the truth of their beginning doth not certainely
appeare in Histories, notwithstanding some little
enmity which passed betweene both (for neighbour
kingdoms are not alwaies the greatest friends), and that
little meanes of trading or commerce passed betweene
both; yet God preserued their tongues, intending to vnite
their hearts vnder the happie gouernment, of one
entire and absolute Monarch. So that now the seas are
our wals on the right hand, and on the left hand, wee
neede not feare the Aegyptians, wee are built as a City,
Pacem habens ad inuicem, which is at vnitie within it
selfe: Deus nobis haec otia fecit; fecit nos in gentem vnam,
&amp; quos Deus coniunxit, homo ne separet; God
hath made vs one Nation, and one people, and whome
God hath ioyned, let no man set a sunder.
            Secondly, whereas the confusion of tongues seemes
to make for the difficulty and obscurity of knowledge;
behold the great prouidence of God,Ancient and strāge tongues adde lustre to Sciences. for supposing the
state of man to be (such as it is) wholly corrupted; such
is the neglect of man, that if Arts and Sciences were not
kept secret, as Mysteries concealed in the habite of vnknowne

tongues, assuredly they would neuer be esteemed
in that high account and reputation. If gold were
not digged out of Mynes, with great labor, the losse of
mens liues, and farre transported; if it lay naked and open,
as common as stones, assuredly wee should neuer
regard it. Nouelty and strangenesse moues the minde
of man, more then the true worth and perfection of
things; the ancient tongues are fittest to discouer knowledge,
they are like rich garments, or olde roabes, kept
for the honour and memory of our Ancestours, to shew
our descent and first originall. They are like chaires of
estate, to giue honour and maiesty to Sciences, that thou
shouldest not sodainely approach vnto them, without
some ripenesse and stayednesse in iudgement; and hauing
once attained them, thou shouldest retaine them
in a more magnificent manner.Against translations. Now he that discouers
them, layes open their nakednesse, makes them knowne
to the vulgar eye, and clothes them with a homely attire
of a common and barbarous tongue; as hee offers
great wrong and iniury to all students in generall, so he
doth much abase that Art whereof hee writes, which is
his principall subiect, and whereof he should principally
intend the praise and commendation; and likewise hee
looseth the fruite and end of his labour, for it is impossible
to teach any man perfectly an Art, whereof he shal
not make the profession.
            In this confusion of tongues, the same prouidence of
God doth likewise appeare, as concerning the poynt of
our religion,That the title of Christ and Scripture should cōtinue vnchangeable. and the manifestation of his owne glory;
(not to speake of the wisdome and power of God, who
vnderstandeth all tongues, and searcheth the hidden secrets
of the heart); it shall appeare by these two instances,
first in the humiliation and passion of Christ, notwithstanding
that all the powers of man, together with
the malice of the deuill, did conspire against Christ;

though they put him to a shamefull death, yet could
they neuer alter his superscriptiō, Iesus Nazarenus Rex
Iudaeorum: which was written in three seuerall Languages,
as it were proclayming him to the whole world
the king of the Iewes; though Pylate might bee enforced
to crucifie him, yet he could neuer bee enforced to
alter or change the title, which was lesse in effect, Quod
scripsi, scripsi, for so the wisedome of God hath decreed;
and impossible it was, that one iot or tittle of the lawe
should miscarry, which law whole and entire, together
with the superscription and kingdome of Christ, hath
still beene continued, maugre the attempts of men, the
slanders and reproches of the Iewes, when they themselues
were scattered▪ the malicious practises of the Gē
               tiles,
when they themselues are confounded; the manie
persecutions, and great effusion of blood in the Church,
which indeed did serue as seed to ingender, that so the
blessing of God might appeare in this our confusion of
tongues.
            Secondly, after his exaltation, he tooke occasion by
this diuersity of tongues, to send into the world his holy
and blessed Spirit; which came to the Apostles in the
forme of fiery and clouen tongues,The gift of tongues. 
               Linguas attulit, qui
pro verbo venit, he yt came to beare record to the word,
brought with him multitudes of tongues: by vertue of
these tongues ye Apostles receiued in an instant (without
further teaching, onely by the infusion of Gods spirit,
all manner of languages); wherby it should seeme, that
God intended to restore the ruines of Babell; and to enable
them for their message to all Nations, for euery
mans conuersion; which sodaine gift of tongues, was a
seale of their embassage, and did serue as a miracle to
confirme the truth of their doctrine. See how God
laughes at the counsails of men; men intending to build
vp a tower vnto Heauen, for the continuance of their

memory, God confoundeth their tongues, and brings
their works to confusion. Now God on the other side,
(as it were to make some recompence and satisfaction,
desiring to build Heauen vpon earth, to erect a state of
happinesse, and saluation in the middest of misery and
sinne), layes a better foundation, and giues his Apostles
the gift of all tongues; hee sends downe fiery tongues,
that being like burning Lampes, they might serue to
enlighten and enflame others: these fiery tongues were
clouen, that the benefit might be imparted and redound
vnto others, and not bee reserued whole and entire to
themselues; Habuerunt dissectas linguas, bilingues non
erant,
               The holie Ghost came in fierie tongues. they knew not (though they knew all languages)
the language of Equiuocation; they knew not how
to propose words consisting onely of dead letters, and
bare syllables, hauing stolne away the sense and true
meaning, by (a trick of cousonage) some secret mentall
reseruation. Nay rather their great Lord and Master,
whose seruants and vessels they were, to carry his name
&amp; his title to all Nations; he was verbū in intellectu, a
word first begotten in the vnderstanding of God, borne
againe (as I may so say) in the heart of euery beleeuing
man by faith, and from the heart issuing forth at the
tongue; where he seems to be again incarnate, clothed
with the basenes of our words, as he was formerly clothed
with ye vildnesse of our flesh. Thus ye Apostles preached
nothing but Iesus, their workes were all wrought
by the power &amp; name of Iesus, all their thoughts were
sanctified by the spirit of Iesus; as they appeared outwardly,
such was their inward substance, (Holocaustū
               )
a whole burnt sacrifice, set on fire with these fiery tongs,
kindling and enlightening the whole world, and leauing
sparkes of this fire to their successours, (for the
lampes must alwaies burne in the Temple, Exod. 27.
vers. 20). The Church must alwaies be visible, that men

may know where to repaire for their soules health) by
vertue of the most holy imposition of hands.
            I will not stay my time,The Author here humbly craues pardon for all his errors. and in the latter end of my
speech craue pardon for all my offēces, here rather I wil
now snatch at the present occasion, so fitly offered: if I
haue spoken any thing, or shall hereafter speake in this
Pamphlet, vnaduisedly, illiterately, without good order
or methode; acknowledge (I beseech thee) the generall
punishment of whole mankinde, which more especially
discouers it selfe in my weakenesse, the confusion of
tongues. I am confounded, I am confounded, poore
silly wretch that I am, I am confounded, my minde is
distracted, my tongue is confounded, and my whole
nature corrupted; in me, in mee alone, see the punishment
of whole mankinde, learne now to be compassionate,
and pitifull, for I cannot altogether 
                  〈…〉
               
               Nihil humani à te alienum putes, here is thy benefite indeed,
my weakenesse appeares, the presse hath proclaimed
it, this Pamphlet can witnesse it; and thine is yet
vndiscouered.
            Now in this generall confusion,He recals himselfe. I know not where to
betake my selfe, or what to speake in the next place, for
my tongue is confounded: I will therefore suppose my
selfe to be lost in the woods, and that at length after
much wandering I should recall my selfe; and finding
no way for my passage, I should haue recourse to my
Carde, and consider the intended scope of my iourney,
from whence I came, Natus ex muliere; my present state
and condition, I am a soiourner and stranger, as all my
forefathers were; the scope and end of my trauell, Puluis
in puluerem, from dust to dust, that so (at length) I
might safely arriue to mine own natiue Country, à statu
viae ad statum patriae. Now certainely right reason
would thus informe and instruct mee, Vt secundum rectam
lin
                     •
                  am incedam, that borne of the dust, and tending

to the dust, I should keep my straight way, neither
puft vp with pride aboue my naturall state, nor sinking
downe with despaire beneath my condition; that I
should not vpon any occasion start out of the way, but
remembring my beginning, remembring my end, I
should square out my course and trauaile accordingly.
Intending therfore to speak of the Fall of Man, the corruption
of nature, &amp; the punishment of the first sinne, I
will lay aside all other slighter punishments, all chastisements
and corrections of sinne, which were infinite to
repeate; and I will onely insist in those two generall
iudgements, being indeed the extreames, the first and
the last, including all other punishments within their
bounds, 1. In dolore paries, thou shal
                  •
                bring forth with
paine and sorrow, being spoken to the woman; 2.
Morte morieris, thou shalt dye the death, pronounced
indifferently against both: and thus his corruption shal
appeare by his first welcome and salutation into this
world, and by his last adue and farewell out of his
world; you shall better iudge of the whole course of
his entertainement in this world.
            
               In dolore paries,
               The punishment in womens conception and deliuery. Gen. 3. vers. 16. Vnto the woman God
said, I will greatly increase thy sorrowes and thy conceptions:
in sorrow shalt thou bring foorth children, &amp;c. As
the woman first sinned in tasting the forbidden fruite,
so she is punished in the fruite of her owne wombe;
here is the fruite of Gods iustice. But is it possible, that
the most naturall action, which indeede intends the
highest perfection of nature, generare sibi simile, should
notwithstanding proceede with such difficultie, danger,
and torment? In all other actions and workes of
nature, you shall easily obserue, how they flow with the
greatest ease and delight of the subiect. O how sweete
and acceptable is sleepe to the wearisome body, meate
to the hungrie, drinke to the thirstie! and so for al other

naturall workes! I will not insist in them; take death
it selfe, as it is natural to man, so vndoubtedly it is without
sorrow or griefe: for the punishment was, morte
morieris, but not, in dolore morieris: if you will suppose
man to rise by steps and degrees, and to fall againe by
the same steps and degrees; suppose him (I say) growing
vnto 25. yeers, when the moysture seemes to bridle
his heate; then increasing in strength vnto 33. yeeres,
there to come to a state of consistencie, vntill 50. yeeres
be expired; then by the same degrees declining and
decaying, so that his moysture and heate giues place to
his coldnesse and drinesse; comming at length to the
disease of old age, without any vnnaturall distemper,
assuredly his life shall end as doth a lampe for want of
oyle, fire for want of fuell, without any paine or torment:
but as the breath proceedes from his nostrels, so
shall the soule take her flight, and leaue the carkase behinde
her; for heerein consists the difference betweene
naturall and vnnatural actions, the one performed with
the greatest ease and facilitie, the other being wrung
out with violence, carrie in themselues torture and sorrow.
Thus all diseases proue therefore our torments,
because they are vnnaturall; then why should nature
be defectiue in her highest worke, that conception and
deliuerie should bee with such sorrow? whereas the
principall intent of nature is to preserue her selfe, and
to propagate her seed: behold the punishment and corruption
of nature, when she cannot performe the one,
without the great hazard and danger of the other; this
certainly cannot consist with the first institution, and
integritie of nature, but is a subsequent punishment accompanying
our sinne.
            Consider all other creatures, and you shall finde that
by the seate and disposition of their wombes; by the
forme, figure, and members of the embrion; by the proportion

and quantitie betweene both;Other creatures are compared with mā in his birth. there should be
as great, if not a farre greater difficultie in their production,
then in the generation of man: And yet you shall
finde it farre otherwise, notwithstanding the numbers
which many creatures bring foorth at once, and euery
one of thē carrying the like proportion to the damme,
as the childe doth to the mother; yet are they able to
worke, and continue in their full strength, vntill the instant
time of their deliuerie, they know the iust time of
their bearing, and doe prepare themselues accordingly;
they can hasten or prolong the time of their bringing
foorth; which well argues their strength of nature,
and the action without paine; they are neuer so perfectly
sound, vnlesse they are bearing, some of them
bringing foorth by great numbers at once; others
bring foorth euery day, as our common hens; and all of
them seeme to promise a kinde of certaintie in their
bearing, and yet in all of them the proportion, whether
for weight, quantitie, or figure appeares to be the same
with vs; and therefore should inforce the like sorrow,
and difficultie in them as in the woman. Yet they crie
for no helpe of midwiues, they want no keepers, or nurses;
they are deliuered without paine, or sorrow, they
haue foorthwith strength to make their owne prouision,
for themselues, for their brood; yea their courage
seems much to be increased, that vpon any slight occasion
they are so ready to fight in defence of their yong
ones. Will you see their ioy immediatly vpon their deliuerie?
hearke, hearke (the pratling gossip) the cackling
henne, as soone as an egge is laid, (though at all other
times she seemes to be mute) yet now she sings, and disquiets
the whole house; either to boast of the fruitfulnes
of her wombe, or to discouer her hidden treasure:
lest the goodwife should thinke her barley and corne
ill spent, behold a free oblation and profit, to recompence

the losse; or to be a president and example to vs,
to teach women their manner in Churching, which
ought to be with a song of ioy and thankfulnes to God,
for the fruits of their wombe, and for their happy deliuery.
            If some other creatures seeme to labour in the birth,
then acknowledge, that for mans sinne the whole earth
was accursed,How this punishment is to be vnderstood. and the dumbe creatures groane vnder
the burthen of our sinne; and therfore no maruaile, if
sometimes they share with vs in the punishment: for
thence we conclude the great offence, the malignitie
and infection of sinne, but I speake vt plurimum, for the
most part, it fals out among them not in one of a hundred;
but in mans kinde it doth most eminently appeare,
and therefore acknowledge vs to be the principals,
and them only as the accessaries in sinne. Againe,
if some women be of that strong constitution, so made
and fashioned by nature, so helpt and furthered by art,
that they are easily deliuered; yet still are they deliuered
with some paine, and I speake vt plurimum, for the most
part; generally in the whole kind, you shall obserue it a
punishment, if some do better escape then others, it is
Gods mercy to them, not one of a hundred but suffers
a great torment: more or lesse griefe alters not the truth
of Gods iudgements, when sorrow it selfe was the punishmēt.
As likewise in that other punishment of death,
some die without paine; as many in their ould age,
when their body is not so sensible, the least stopping of
their breath puts out their candle; whereas the yong
man sicke of the stone or the pluri
                  •
               ie, dies in great tortures,
for heere the paines and torments of death were
not the punishment, but death it selfe: so likewise in
child-bearing, more or lesse sorrow was not appointed,
the measure of sorrow was not prescribed, but sorrow
in generall here was the punishment; though Scripture

and all ancient writers, do number it amongst the greatest
torments: sometimes indeed Gods iustice is allayed
with his mercy, and his wisdome permits the workes of
nature to passe vncontrolable; that so it might appeare,
that our sorrowes and infirmities proceed not from the
necessity of our nature, but from the incident malignity
of our sinne.
            Reasons (I know) there are alleaged in Physicke and
Philosophy, for this great paine in the birth and generation
of man: suppose it did proceed from natural causes,Naturall causes cannot demonstrate the paine.
yet would it then argue a great corruption of nature,
that should thus ordaine the beginning of man
with the great sorrow and griefe of his mother; as if
man were of a viperous kinde and brood, gnawing the
bowels that first hatched and conceaued him: but I do
assure you, that if you shall well weigh all those causes,
which seeme to produce the torments, you shall find
them very much defectiue, and such as cannot giue you
any satisfaction; but herein I must be sparing in regard
of my profession, and speaking in a common and vulgar
tongue; these are secrecies proper to woman, yet I may
boldly say it, that nature heerein seemes to outstrip her
selfe, and to torment the poore woman beyond all natural
causes. For the trees in producing their fruit, seeme
then to be most beautifull, and do yeerely afford it; all
the beasts of the field do the like in the time of their
greatest growth, and best perfection: only the the woman
notwithstanding her strength and ablenesse of body,
it will not excuse her; notwithstanding her good
complection, and sound constitution, it will not auaile
her, for she is only subiect to sorrow.
            Sorrow I say, for there is no sorrow comparable to
the sorrow of a woman in the time of her trauaile; from
their first quickning or conception you shall obserue
them, with pale lookes, heauy eyes, apt to faint vpon

euery occasion,The continuall danger and paine in conception. they are a burthen to themselues, their
stomackes faile them, and the night giues them no rest;
all the deuouring and rauenous wilde beasts are aptest
to seaze vpon them; the least knocke or blowe, the least
ill sauour or bad sight, the least sorrow conceiued in the
fansie, is able to indanger all; to hazard the life both of
the mother, and of the childe in her wombe. Not to
speake of the naturall greife arising from natural causes,
sometimes nature seemes with too much expedition to
hasten her woe, and then ye haue an vntimely brood, as
if Autum should fall out in the spring; sometimes the
wombe proues likewise the tombe, and the place of
conception, serues for his buriall; after seauen or nine
moneths expectation, behold hee comes, carrying
the forme of a slaine and a murthred man, and so he presents
himselfe to his sad mother, to comfort her heauie
heart; being once thus deliuered, the danger is not past,
but she must be attended on with safe keeping and
good diet; and thousands daylie miscarry, when in
mans expectation they seeme to haue ouerpassed al danger
of child-birth.
            But heere I will acquaint you with a strange point of
crueltie, men must become wiues, men among wiues,
men-midwiues I meane;Men-midwiues. who with the strength of their
limbes, and in the hardnesse of their hearts, must execute
that, which the weaker sex (compassionat women)
durst neuer attempt: pittie it were that there should be
such a profession of men, were it not, that necessity inforceth
it; before I can speake of them with patience,
I will first fall downe on my knees, hould vp my hands, lift
vp mine eyes, and (if I can) I will shed forth a few t

                  s,
and humblie desire God to helpe, and comfort all those
poore sillie women, which shall haue occasion to vse their
helpe: heere you shall see sometimes the bellies opened,
the flesh rent, the tunicles cut in sunder, to finde out a

new passage for the poore infant, who must come into
this world through the bowels of his dead mother, and
vpon his first approch, may be iustly accused, and arraigned
for a murtherer; if his mother escape, then sometimes
you may see the poore innocent childe mangled,
executed and quartered in the wombe: there was no
great offence (I confesse), vnlesse it were the sin of his
first father; but indeed I am affraid to speake any longer
of these bloudy cruelties, I will not lay open my nakednesse,
I will not defile mine owne neast, the punishment
sufficiently appeares, and well betokens the corruption.
            As I haue made man the instrumēt of cruelty, so I cannot
alwayes &amp; altogether excuse him,Men bearing their owne children. from the paine in
her trauell; and therfore here in the middest of sorrow,
I will bring forth a subiect of laughter; I will set him vpon
the stage, I pray' obserue him aright: Did you neuer
heare of fathers, which breed and beare their own children?
their wiues conceiue, and the husbands, who
shuld be the only comfort in the time of their weaknes,
first begin to complaine of the sorrow; Iuno Lucina fer
opem, I pray' send for the midwiues, and let vs see what
this great mountaine will bring forth: forsooth his teeth
ake, his bones are crasie, his eye-sight fayles him, hee is
troubled with rheumes, sometimes with the megrime;
Physicke will not helpe him, the times of the yeere will
not auaile him, but the poore man must expect his wiues
deliuerie. Hath God ordained this to shew the entire
league, and compassionat heart, that should passe between
man and wife, and how they are both equally ingaged
in the issue? hath God appointed this to teach
man and wife, that the end of their loue should tend to
procreation? strange it were and wonderfull in nature,
were it not, that the husband is the sonne of a woman,
and therfore partakes of her weaknes and imperfection,

               partus sequitur ventrem, and is in some sort lyable to
her curse.
            Heere you would expect of me, that I should assigne
and point out the causes of this fellow-feeling,Why God so punisheth the husband. and
strange affection between man &amp; wife; happily I could
guesse at some of them, but for certainty I know none:
rather I would flie to the diuine prouidence, beyond the
reach and compasse of nature; who for assuring man,
that he himselfe hath coupled them together, and that
both persons are but one flesh, therefore he hath giuen
them but one sense &amp; feeling of the same sorrow. That
as in their estate one and the same calamity doth equally
befall them; so in their persons, one and the same misery
doth equally attach them, which God hath ordained
by secret, and hidden causes best known to himselfe;
that, as many diseases are infectious, and spred
themselues by the company and society of others; so
here the same handie worke of God appeares, to the astonishment
of naturall Philosophy.
            Will you yet presse me further, to lay open the secret
causes,Why there are secret qualities which cannot be knowne. and hidden qualities of things: suppose the sympathie
and antipathie of creatures; my answere is, that
these arise from the great conformity, or contrariety of
temper in the inbred qualities, and naturall constitution:
in so much that you shall obserue, that in such liuing
creatures, in whom there is an antipathie (suppose
them to be dead), yet in their very carkases, in the bones
and the flesh, as long as any spice of their temper remaines,
the contrariety will appeare in the different and
contrary operations. Now this contrariety appeares,
not in the contrary qualities alone, but in the degrees of
these qualities, and in such degrees, as they are best fitted
and proportioned to each other: nature it should
seeme hath ballanced them, and squared them out fit
for the combat. Now the degrees of things are infinit,

as time is diuided into infinite moments, quantitie into
infinit points; so qualitie into infinit degrees, and things
infinit do not fall within the reach of mans comprehension;
neither are the formes of things subiect to our
knowledge, propter nimiam actiuitatem, for as things
are in nature compounded, so in the vnderstanding of
man they cannot be found simple: the influence of the
heauens is wholly vnknowne, propter spiritualitatem,
as being no way materiall or sensible; whereas all mans
knowledge must presuppose the foundation &amp; information
of sense. And thus it is no maruaile, if many things
in nature be wholly vnknowne; when as the forme is
vnknowne, the influence vnknowne, the degrees of
qualities vnknowne: that so the first curiosity of mans
knowledge, might be iustly recompensed with blindnesse
and ignorance.
            Philosophy (as likewise all other arts and sciences),
treates onely of things generall, and cannot descend to
things in particular,The extent of Philosophy concerning her subiects. with their par
                  •••
               ular degrees: as for
example, we diuide this sublunary world, into foure elements,
euery element into three regions; here we consider
two qualities, one in extremitie, the other remisse;
these qualities we diuide into foure seuerall degrees:
the Physitian he descends somewhat lower, &amp; doubles
his fyles, deuides them into eight, as may bee best fitting
for his purpose, and here hee stands and cannot
march any further. For compound bodies, we consider
their kindes, their formes, their constitution, their properties,
their differences, and common accidents: we reduce
nature (which appeares confused to mans vnderstanding)
into a certaine method, appointing the
bounds of sciences, to bee the meares for our gouernment,
and direction in the course of our studies; and in
euery science we consider the principles, the subiect, and
the affections; as far as God hath inabled man, so far

hath the industrie of man transported his knowledge;
yet we cannot descend to particulars, God hath denied
this perfection, as it appeares; for the obiects of the
sense are singulars, the obiects of the vnderstanding are
vniuersals: as the sense cannot exceed his own bounds,
and eleuate it selfe to the height of the vnderstanding;
so neither can the vnderstanding stoope downe to the
sense: God hath giuen vs an inspection of nature, but
no absolute and perfect knowledge of nature, hauing
reserued that for himselfe.
            Hee that shall desire to bee better informed in these
hidden and secret qualities, I would referre him to
those learned authors, from whom (I suppose) he should
receiue good contentment, and satisfaction: as namely,
Aristotle, Albertus Magnus, Zimara, Fracastorius
and others. Now for this present instance,Why the husband partakes in the wifes passions. why the husband
should be thus affected in his wiues conception; it
is not vnknowne to al skilfull Musitians, the great concord
which is betweene the eights; not onely for the
sweete harmonie of musicke, but if the Instrument shall
be thus set, and disposed for the purpose, the one string
being easily touched, the other will likewise moue for
companie: assuredly between man and wife, their loue
and their affections concurring together, there is likewise
a greater sympathie, and agreement in their naturall
temper and constitution, and therefore are fitter
disposed to worke vpon each others body; as kindred
descending from one stocke, are apter to infect and annoy
each other in a pestilent disease. Besides their constitution,
man and wife liuing together, feeding on the
same meates, resting together, and conuersing together,
as at all times, so sometimes, when their bodies are
more apt to be tainted; no marueile if some husbands,
(and yet but a few, for God gaue man his wife for his
help, &amp; not for his sorrow) do partake in their passions.
            
               Lest the enemies of learning, the enemies of religion
should here condemne vs; and for this one defect
(being not able to make plaine demonstration of all secrets
and hidden qualities) should therefore thinke our
knowledge vnprofitable;A defence of Philosophie. I would gladly aske, what inuention
in the world was euer more beneficiall to man,
then was the Mariners Carde, to direct him in his passage
thorow the huge wildernesse of the vaste Ocean?
yet can you conceiue, that the world could bee exquisitely
diuided by 32. parts (for so many windes are assigned)?
shall acres, miles, leagues, whole Countries,
huge Nations, make no sensible difference in this Card,
and yet is the Carde so exquisite, and of such necessary
vse? Or take an Almanacke, though it faile in prognostication
of weather, is it therfore not of excellent vse?
Learning it is, which opens mans eies to all humane
knowledge; though it cannot, or will not vouchsafe to
looke vpon the basest things of this life, yet it containes
the grounds, the roots, the causes of euery the meanest
profession, and is able to direct euery man in his owne
Trade, course, and vocation: and I may boldly speake
it (absit inuidia verbo) all other professions whatsoeuer,
if they be not spiced and seasoned with learning, they
are base and barbarous; if they bee not sanctified and
hallowed with Religion, they are prophane and heathenish.
            I haue forgotten my selfe, and whether out of the
loue of Philosophie, or out of mine owne modestie, desiring
to conceale these points of secrecie (the paines

filth breakes out into issues and sores; and therein assures
man, that he is not onely conceiued in sinne, and
corruption, but likewise feedes vpon corruption: for
what is milke it selfe, but onely impure blood, the colour
changed? Now if these parts, which border so neere
vpon the heart, be corrupted; then assuredly the heart
it selfe is full of corruption, the roote of life, and nature
her selfe is wholly corrupted: and therefore those parts,
which were ordained for the nourishment of poore
sucking babes, together with life together with foode
for the continuance of life, doe by a law of necessitie,
impart their owne corruption.
            For the males, they are not excused from the like sorrow;
what strange and noysome diseases doe befall the
generatiue parts? lues venerea, priapismus, gonorrhaea;
I am ashamed of my selfe, and me thinkes my mouth is
defiled with speaking of them: onely giue me leaue to
reckon vp one among the miseries proper to this time,
among the inuentions and monsters of this last age, for
the ancients neuer heard of it. There is a disease begotten
amongst vs,The French or Neapoli

                  an disease. and no nation will father it, all are ashamed
of it; we cast it on the French, the French on the

from a new-found world; a disease which ariseth from

               oderate lust▪ noysome, infectious▪ corrupting the
bones, rotting the flesh, loosing and dissoluing the ligaments.
A iust punishment for mans lust, that since
beautie allured him, &amp; his own natural strength prouoked
him, therfore God wil punish him with the losse of
his beautie, his fauour shall faile him, hi
                  •
                eye-sight shal
leaue him, his colour forsake him, his nose shal drop off,
his lips shall be eaten, his palate shall be cankerd, and
his strength shall be like a broken staffe; he shall goe

like a criple, shame and reproch shall attend him. Fully
to describe this disease, I will leaue it to the skilfull
Physitian; let it suffice for me to obserue, that although
some other creatures seeme to be as much inclining to
their lust, as is man; yet none are tainted with such a
noysome disease, saue only man: as likewise in all former
times, among the Heathen and Pagans, there is no
mention of any such disease, much lesse of the cure; only
amongst vs Christians, who professe a more strict, austere
and mortified life, this disease first tooke her beginning.
That seeing God had giuē vs a greater knowledge
of his truth, of the foulnesse of sinne, together
with a larger measure of his grace; therefore God punisheth
the vncleannes &amp; incontinencie of these times,
with a greater iudgement, and vengeance: and as the
woman partakes in the mans punishment, both of them
sweating in their labours, both of them made subiect to
death; so man (as farre foorth as it will stand with the
condition of his sexe) partakes in her sorrow.
            These things being duly considered, (if I were worthy)
I would giue this aduice to Ladies, and Gentle women,
who now labour in the paines and perill of childbirth;
that during this time,An aduice to women. they would better bethinke
themselues of the occasion; that their danger and sorrow
is the iust punishment of sinne, for the first offence
of the woman: and that they would giue God most
humble and heartie thankes, for that greatest blessing
of all other temporall blessings, the fruitfulnes of the
wombe; whereby it pleaseth God, to inlarge his owne
kingdome, to accomplish the whole number of his elect;
whereby they might continue their names, and
their memories, and finde some comfort in their olde
age; leaue their posteritie behinde them, to giue them
a Christian buriall, and to performe all other duties of
children to parents. This I could heartily wish, but see

the corruption of these times! they turne this punishment,
to a point of their owne pride, vaine-glorie, and
solemnitie; their lying-in, or bedding being performed
in such state, with such pompe, so excessiuely, costly,
and chargeable; that I feare they haue little thought
either of thankfulnes to God, or of the punishment of
sinne.
            Now giue me leaue to relate some few accidencies,
which doe accompanie our conception, whereof I may
speake without offence: Consider (I pray') how du
                  ••
               ng
the time of their conception,Womens longing. while our parents are yet
great, what a longing and hungrie appetite possesseth
them of things hard to be gotten, most commonly vntimely
and vnseasonable fruites, sometimes of things
vncleane and impure. Is not this an vndoubted token
and testimonie of that insolent, and vnbridled appetite
of the woman, which first contrarie to Gods owne precept
and ordinance, seazed vpon the forbidden fruite?
But obserue (I beseech you) how this appetite and
longing, consisting onely in the fansie and imagination
of the mother,An impression vpon the child in the wombe. yet sometimes, to the great wonder, and
astonishment of reason, workes vpon the childe in the
wombe, and makes an impression answerable to the
thing conceiued in the fansie: the fansie can neither
giue sexe, nor beautie, nor strength to the members, yet
doth it imprint a character answerable to the strong
apprehension. See heere a liuely patterne of the propagation
of sinne; there are hereditarie diseases of the bodie,
there are wants and defects proper to the minde,
there are infirmities and sins of both: sin is intailed to
our nature, though it proceed frō the free-will and consent
of man, yet is it grounded in nature, and therfore al
the naturall actions of man, are branded with sinne.
            In the time of their deliuerie, I haue heard it credibly
reported, and so I may affirme it vpon tradition, that

nothing so much asswageth their paine, and giues them
that ease,The skinne of a Serpent. as the cast-away skinne of a Serpent, being
fitly applied for that purpose: I will not dispute of the
naturall reason, which assuredly consists in the strange
antipathie betweene both; only I do here blesse God,
that hath so ordained nature, as it might best serue for a
supernaturall end; when all naturall meanes shall faile,
and cannot preuent a naturall griefe, yet the remembrance
and thought of the Serpent, which was the first
occasion of this griefe, should mitigate this paine. Here
is a kinde of magicall inchauntment, to heale wounds
by the application of that sword which first gaue the
blow; like the Israelites in the wildernesse wounded by
the Serpent, they are likewise cured by the brasen Serpent.
It serues also as a memoriall of Gods great bountie
and goodnesse, that if God in this miraculous manner
by changing the skinne, renewes the age of the Serpent;
then certainly man in his issue, hath some kinde of
eternitie, for the young childe seemes to renew the age
of his parents. And the poore mother calling to minde
Gods mercie to the Serpent, who was the first seducer
and greatest offender, may well hope for a greater measure
of that mercie; and in her greatest torments and
griefe, acknowledging the iust punishment of sin, may
expect a better state and condition, when God shall renew
al things, change their old habits, and restore them
to their first perfection. Thus are the present miseries of
this life, seasoned with the assured hope, and expectation
of a better world to succeed.
            I cannot thus leaue the punishment in the mother,
but I must likewise trace it in the infant. Comming into
the world,Obseruations in the birth of man. wee come with our heads forwards, as it
were stumbling into life, which vndoubtedly argues
our fall, for our birth is praecipitium, a break-necke, as if
we were cast headlong downe from some mount. Being

thus borne, wee carrie the image and representation rather
of slaine men, then of men beginning to liue; such
effusion of blood, such vncleannesse, as could not possibly
stand with the integritie of our first nature, as if
wee were borne vnder that law &amp; condition, that needs
we must dye, and therefore wee came into the world
that indeede we might goe out of the world. Many are
borne with caules on their faces, which betokens their
modestie and shame, as if Adam should couer his nakednesse
with leaues: here wee are fast bound vp with
swadling-cloutes, for wee are captiues and prisoners,
borne vnder the slauerie and bondage of Egypt, and for
a time wee can doe nothing but crie, to moue pitie and
compassion: all our rest consists in motion, wee sleepe
while the cradle is rockt, and so in the succeeding
course of our liues, wee seeme to flatter our s
                  •
               lues, with
ease and securitie, when as indeede all things are in an
vprore.
            At length wee begin to open our eyes, and to looke
about vs, and here we wonder and admire all things, as
being strangers arriued in a new-found world; we are
apt to place our loue on euery obiect,Obseruations in the infancie of man. and cannot direct
our selues aright; there is nothing which seemes pleasant
to the sight, nor any prety toy, but straight we must
crie for it, it must be ours, we must possesse it, otherwise
the whole house shall not bee able to containe vs, no
fruite of the garden must be excluded. See heere whether
that fruite, which was gustu suaue, &amp; visu delectabile,
would not againe serue to allure man? Not long
after our hearing and speech will serue vs, then wee begin
to hearken after old wiues tales, and fables; wee
cannot be content with our food, and our raiment, but
we must heare some stories of Li
                  ••
               s, of Beares, and the
like; old women and nurses (forsooth) they must relate
them: Lord, what skilfull teachers wee haue gotten! as

if Adam were againe to be instructed by Eue, and that
wee should all learne our lesson, and take aduice from
the Serpent; see how this curiositie of knowledge possesseth
young children, as much as euer it did ye first Adam,
but more immediatly and especially resides in the
womankinde: whereas a maide should be mute, she is
not afraid to dispute;The curiositie of women taxed. she should be a cooke for her sexe,
she would buy a booke for her sects; in liew of a mate,
she must illuminate; if once she proues gossip, then she
proceeds to a Doctorship, and she can be no mistresse,
vnlesse she know mysteries. Thus they haue degrees of
schooles among them, and therefore may lawfully
weare their hoods and their habits: they are not content
to follow their seuerall callings and professions,
wherein they might serue God, since it was God that
ordained them; not content with our ordinary Catechisme,
which they in their wisedome call beggerly rudiments,
or some, implicite faith; but as if euery part
were ordained to bee an eye, and that women should
proue teachers in the Church, they begin to enquire of
predestination, reprobation, prelection, free-will, the
state of innocency, the time of the generall iudgement,
&amp;c. Here are excellent wits indeed, that cannot admit
any bounds of their knowledge; if there were a tree of
knowledge in the middest of Paradise, for the triall of
their obedience, you should easily discouer in them the
same disposition. And hence follow such monsters of
opinions, such mishapen conceits, together with such
neglect, contempt▪ and such a base respect of their ordinary
Pastor; as that you would not imagine such disobedience,
were it not, that the same corruption and curiositie
of knowledge did first appeare in the roote,
which now buds foorth in the branches.
            How credulous and easie of beliefe are the young
children, as if they were fit subiects to be againe seduced

by the serpent? how do they rather incline vnto
hate then vnto loue,The corruption of yong children. out of the malignitie and corruption
of their owne nature, as it were laying the foundation
of that Machiauelian policie, that Friendship is vncertaine,
but hate is irreconcileable? see their obstinacy
and wilfulnesse, if you forbid them any thing, the more
you forbid it, the sooner they will attempt it, 
                  
                     •
                  itimur in
vetitum! see how we follow the footsteps of our forefathers▪
we neede not be taught this lesson, aspis à vipera,
disobedience is now become naturall vnto vs! see
how these little children will alwayes attempt the most
dangerous actions, as clyming vp of ladders, sliding vpon
the ice, running ouer bridges, playing with edged
tooles, skipping ouer benches! to shewe that the same
nature still continues in those little impes, which vnder
colour of bouldnes and courage, proues indeed to bee
rashe and desperat: suppose them to be weake and faint,
not able to vndertake such great exployts; see then (of
all other places) how they make choice of the basest! the
sinke, the chanell, the chymnie, wallowing in the mire,
all daubde on with durt; that were it not to signifie the
vncleannesse of mans conception and birth, I should
much maruaile at natures intent herein.
            See, see these little children, how apt they are to
learne all lewdnesse and naughtinesse! if there be but a
nicke-name,How exceedingly children doe loue fruits. or a leud song, or some libellous rime, you

retentiue of memory, as that you would thinke it wonderfull;
whereas in all good learning, there is such a
dulnesse, such a backwardnesse, such forgetfulnes, as that
you would not suppose them to be the same wits. Now
the first offence for which our parents correct vs, it is (for
the most part) the eating of rawe and vntimely fruits; see
how these children do naturally symbolize with their
parents! and as of nature, so there is a conformitie of

wils; as soone as our strength serues vs, then wee begin
to rob orchards, to rifle aple-lofts, ceasing vpon forbidden
fruits, as if we could not leaue our ould

               aunt, or
that we did claime a bad custome by prescription; but I
pray' marke the euent, this eating of fruits ingendreth
wormes in their mawe, their stomackes, and bowels,
their tender yong bodies become quicke sepulchers, a
wombe for the wormes to feed vpon their liuing carkases;
see here the eating of this fruit, giues them the first
token and assurance of their mortalitie, morte morieris.
            
            But I forget my selfe; vnles I should here stay (I feare)
I should againe and againe run through the whole
course of his life, neither indeed dare I far proceed in
this subiect, for I know what some will say, that bachelors
children are euer well taught; giue me therefore
leaue retiring far backe, to make the longer leape, from
the cradle to the coffin; being fast bound vp with swadling
cloutes, I will exchange them for my winding
sheet, and so in the last place I come to the last punishment
of the first sinne; morte morieris, thou shalt die the
death, Gen. 3. v. 19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eate bread, till thou returne to the earth, for out of it wast
thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou
returne. I confesse indeed, I shal incurre a disorderly method,
if you consider the course and order of nature, for
nature passeth by degrees, natura non facit saltum, she
takes no leape; but when I consider the necessity of
death, together with the casualtie and vncertainty of all
other accidents which may befall man (statutum est hominibus
mori, there is a statute past that al men must die;
but peraduenture I shall be rich, I shall be poore; peraduenture
I shall grow ould, I shall be blind; peraduenture
I shall be lame, I shall be a criple; but without all peraduenture
I shall die; thus there being a necessity of death,

together with a great vncertaintie of the time) I do appeale
to the strictnesse and rigour of lawe,The author iustifieth his method by lawe. that if a debt
must be discharged and no due time be appointed, then
we must prepare for a present payment; so that it cannot
seeme much against method, though I speake of death,
immediatlie vpon our first receiuing of breath.
            If all other creatures were subiect to death, yet (me
thinks) obseruing the course and prouidence of nature,Mans death is compared with the death of dumbe beasts.
man should be exempted from death: consider the high
prerogatiue of man; in all restringent and penall lawes,
the Prince is excluded, to shew his high estate aboue
the ranke and condition of subiects: now man is the
king of the creatures, let other creatures bee lyable to

                  •
               laughter, for they were ordained and directed to man;
let other creatures die of themselues, for in them there
is nothing but nature, nature which hath a certaine
course and period, a time of rising and a time of setting:
but the first fountaine of life in man, is the inuisible and
immortall soule free from corruption, free from all
change and alteration, as in her owne substance, so in
her actions; she cannot bee inforced or determinated,
but is beyond the Precincts of nature, and therefore no
way tyed to follow the ordinary course of nature. Yet
some beasts do far exceed man in life and continuance
of being, which is the foundation and ground worke of
nature, to support all other blessings; and therfore seems
to be the highest prerogatiue of nature, wherein notwithstanding
man is defectiue: other creatures (indeed)
seeme to attaine their perfection in their ends, or their
death; the hearbes serue for the food of beasts, and in
their bodies and carkases they haue a more excellent
being, then they had in their greene blades; the flesh
of beasts becomes the nourishment of man, and being
made part o
                  •
                mans own flesh, heere is the height of all
their preferment; now in man, you shall obserue it far

otherwise, who (of the mirror and miracle of nature) by
his own death, is suffered to putrifie and to be deuoured
of the basest wormes; as if his body were ordained to
be the compost of the earth, and did only serue to make
the Church-yard fat with the oyle of his flesh, and to
paue the high wayes with the sculs and bones of dead
men.
            Consider this inferior world, consisting of the same
different and contrary elements, yet still continuing in
the same state; assuredly it is no greater difficulty to preserue
man from death,Mans death in respect of the elements. then to preserue the whole
world from corruption: for the same causes appeare in
both, the elements and the elementarie qualities, and
once in euery mans age they are equally tempered, as it
were the Equinoctial of his age. Then why should there
not be a state of consistencie in man, as well as in the
whole world? or at least, why should not the periods
and times of his age, the spring of his infancie, the summer
of his youth, the haruest of his riper yeares, the winter
of his old age, goe and returne according to the reuolution
of times, seasons, and changes of the yeere;
which seeme to bee therefore onely allotted, for the
continuance and preseruation of mankind?
            Not to insist alone in this sublunarie world; strange
it is, that the heauens themselues which were onely ordained
for mans vse,Mans death in respect of the heauens and the Angels. should so long continue without
change or alteration, and man himselfe in the whole
course of his life, should not be able to see a reuolution:
that the superiour causes preseruing mans life, should
moue by a most certaine and vnchangeable rule, as the
diuine prouidence hath appointed them; and yet mans
life to which all is ordained, should be most subiect and
lyable to the greatest hazard, chance, and vnc
                  •
               rtainty.
But most strange it is, that the heauens bei
                  •
               g Gods
blessed instruments to continue life, quicken sense, stir

vp motion, yet with their malignant and dis-astrous aspects,
should cause the ouerthrow of man, yea sometimes
of whole nations and kingdomes: consider the
end of mans creation, which was the praise and glory
of his maker, which end is eternall, as God himselfe is
eternall; then why should not those things, which are
ordained only to this end, be of like eternitie and continuance?
God is not like man, that he should be altered
and changed, that he should repent himselfe of his own
workes, and restore againe that vnto nothing, which he
himselfe hath once made according to his owne image:
neither is God the God of the dead but of the liuing,
being life in himselfe; shall the dust rise vp and praise
him, shall his iustice appeare in the graue? or rather
shall the prayers, the voyces and harmony of men, ioynd
with the quire and sweet melody of Angels, sing prayses
vnto him and magnifie his holy name, which indeed
was the scope and end of our creation? thus not onely
Christian religion, but euen reason it selfe, and mans
owne knowledge seeme to preach this lesson, that the
end of nature (man) to whom all nature is ordained and
directed, should not end in nature; and therefore death
it selfe especially to man, is a punishment of nature, and
in it selfe is most vnnaturall to man.
            Especially when I consider, how the better part of
man (the soule) is immortal and vnchangeable;The soule receiues a kinde of perfection from the body. as in her
selfe and in her owne substance, so in her qualities and
actions: now the life of man, being only the worke of
his soule, and the sweet influence of his quickning spirit,
into the dull flesh; I do much maruaile, how this immortall
spirit should bee the cause of our mortality?
for it cannot bee denied, but that the soule receiues
some kinde of perfection from the flesh; for without
the ministery of the body, were not our members the
soules vessels and instruments, she could neuer exercise

those excellent powers of sense and vegetation; &amp;
therefore in her separation, though her state may seeme
to be more perfect then it was, during the time of her
mariage, or couerture with our flesh, our corrupted
flesh, wherein iars and contentions did daily arise to
the great disquieting of both; yet certainly the soule
hauing these faculties, desires the free vse and exercise
of them. Which desire, that it might not be frustrat and
vaine, doth in some sort (by a naturall sequell) inforce a
last resurrection; when the soule shall be re-united to a
spirituall body better befitting it selfe: and in the interim
concludes, that either man is vnnaturally compounded,
or that the separation of his parts, must be wholly
vnnaturall, which I rather suppose; seeing it makes
much for mans dignitie and natures perfection, the
soule no way desiring a separation; for as the state
now stands, there is a kinde of correspondencie, if the
flesh be corrupted, the soule is likewise tainted with
sinne; here is a proportion, though an euill proportion
between both.
            The 
                  •
               oule desiring the continuance of this vnion,
why should she not be able to effect it; she frames and
fashions in the wombe, all the members of mans body
for her owne vse and seruice,The soul
                     •
                   builds the frame of our body. 
               anima fabricatur sibi domicilium:
though Gods power appeares in our making,
yet God vseth meanes, and these meanes can bee none
other, then the actions of the soule it selfe; a baser agent
God would neuer imploy in such an excellent worke,
and a greater worke-man all nature could not afford
him. Now the soule hauing thus framed the body, if she
dislikes any thing, she must blame none but her selfe; if
all things be perfect and sound in the first fabricke and
architecture of man, then in the succeeding actions of
life, the soule is the first fountaine, and the onely acti

principle of all seuerall operations: for I receiue my temper,

my constitution, my colour, my digestion, my nourishment,
my strength, my growth, and all from my
soule. If there be an error or fault, I must blame and cast
the aspersion vpon my soule; that notwithstanding her
owne eternity; yet she should lead me to the paths of
mortality: for herein I dare bouldly excuse mine owne
flesh, my flesh is innocent, if not of my sinne yet of my
bloud; and the soule is the sole murtherer, for the body
is onely subiect to passion, as it please the soule to
worke, so it must suffer: as the soule receiues the praise
and commendation in the goodnesse of her actions;
so let her take vnto her selfe, the shame and reproch in
the defects and imperfections.
            Though there may be (I confesse) some little difference
in the appetites and inclinations of both,The immortal soule is the cause of corruption. proceeding
from the different natures; yet is there no opposition
betweene both, in regard of destroying qualities,
both of them being substances of a diuers kinde, not
capable of contrariety; and therefore a wonder it is, how
they should be ioyned together, or being once coupled
how they shuld be set a

this goodly tabernacle of our bodies, and can she not
repaire and renew the workmanship decayed? seemes
it not a worke of lesse difficulty to repaire then to lay
the first foundation? Can she bring forth a seede to propagate
her owne kinde, and so giue l

to the course and streame of nature, that the better part
of man being priuiledged, and hauing a charter for eternitie;
yet man himselfe should see and taste corruption?
as if the whole did not incl

               de the parts, or that
there were a different condition of the whole from the
parts, contrary to the whole course of nature, and

the wisdome of her first institution.
            Suppose the soule should be defectiue in her actions;
as that for want of a full and perfect concoction, the stomake
should be filled vp with rawe humors, which at
length should seaze vpon the liuer, and there breake
forth like a spring or a fountaine, and so bee conuayed
in the conduit-pipes of our veines, thorough the
trunke of the whole body; yet cannot the soule instantly
recall her selfe, and correct her owne error? cannot
heate bee allayed with couldnesse, moysture with
drought, and euery distemper be cured with the application
of his contrarie? I cannot conceaue the reasonable
soule to be a foole, and therefore needs she must be
a Physitian;How easily the soule may preserue life by a naturall course. you will say that there is a great difficulty
in the receiptes, and therfore the life of man would
hardly suffice to learne the remedy and cure: but I pray'
marke the art and industrie of man, I am verily perswaded,
and I speake it by experience, that mans body, by
the helpe of feare-clothes, powders, balmes, and oyntments,
may bee preserued for the space of two hundred
or three hundred yeeres, in the same state and consistencie
wherein now it is, at least to the outward shew and
appearance; then why should not the like medicines
inwardly taken, preserue life for such a terme of yeeres?
why should not physicke growe to that ripenesse and
perfection, that knowing the nature of diseases, the
course &amp; inclinatiō of humors, by application of cōtraries,
as it were vsing the tree of life in Paradise, it might
prolong mans age, if not for euer giue him eternitie?
But see, see corruption consists in the root, in nature her
selfe! for physicke cannot worke, but must first presuppose
the strength and furtherance of nature: left thou
shouldest blame the Physitian, or thinke the meanes
which God hath appointed for thy health, to be wholie
vnprofitable; behold thine owne nature is wanting

and defectiue to her selfe.
            If nature might faile in her particular ends, yet (me
thinks) the whole scope and generall intent of nature
should not bee frustrate and made voide. There is nothing
so common and triuiall in Schooles (wherein nature
is best discouered,How the death of man is against the whole scope of nature in generall. as is this knowne and palpable
truth) Corruptio vnius est generatio alterius, the death
of one is the birth of another, for nature consists in alteration
and change; and it would much disparage
nature, if there were such a death, as did wholly make
for her losse, and no way redound to her encrease. In
all other creatures you shal obserue this truth: Suppose
a beast were slaine, his body should be dissolued into
the bodies of the elements, his forme into the formes of
the elements, as both of them were first composed
of the elements, nothing should bee lost through the
negligence of nature, but all should be gleaned vp, and
very safely reserued for a new succeeding generation.
Now in the death of man, the body is the sole bootie of
nature, she cannot seaze vpon the soule, she cannot retaine
such an inestimable treasure, the soule is escaped:
as long as life continued in man, the soule was vnder
the iurisdiction and power of nature; but the body being
once dissolued, nature hath lost her owne right, and
cannot intend any new generation by vertue of that
soule. A foule error of nature, that hauing the soule
once committed to her custodie and charge, she should
open the gates, or breake downe the prison walles to
lose such a iewell, which was neuer gotten by her owne
purchase, nor cannot bee recalled againe with all her
might and power: so then in the death of man, and so
man alone, the corruption, and nothing but the corruption
of nature sufficiently appeares.
            I would not willingly speak of a punishment, wherein
the mercie and goodnesse of God should not together

appeare with his iustice: but when I haue once
spoken of death,How death serues to instruct vs. me thinkes I am then come to the vpshot
and conclusion of all, beyond which I cannot extend
any blessing, I meane any naturall blessing, for
death is the end and period of nature; yet giue me leaue
to make these foure good vses of death: 1. To reproue
sinnes: 2. To strengthen and fortifie the bulwarkes of
Religion. 3. As to giue comfort, courage, and resolution
to the true Christian man; 4. so to discomfort, discourage
and put to flight the infidell and heathen.
            First, death seemes to instruct man, to preach vnto
him the reformation of his life, and thereby doth witnesse
his naturall and inbred corruption: the couetous
man,Death is a very powerfull meanes to recall a sinner. whose heart could neuer be touched, or moued to
take pitie or compassion by the cries and prayers of a
poore wretch, yet at length will howle and lament,
when hee considers that hee shall dye in the middest of
his treasure, and all his substance shall leaue him: the
oppressing tyrant, stained with the blood of poore innocents,
shall knocke his owne breast, teare his owne
haire, readie to shed his owne blood, when hee sees the
pale and liuelesse carkase of his persecuted foe, to shew
him his owne state, and condition, and being dead, to
threaten his death: but it were to be wished (if it might
be spoken without offence) that one might arise from
the dead, who might relate vnto vs the state of the
dead, and of the vanities of this life, which passe like a
shadow. And to this end, I haue heard it as a tradition
of the Church, that Christ hauing told the parable of
Diues and Lazarus, and the Iewes little regarding it (to
stirre vp faith in them, as likewise in some sort to satisfie
the request of Diues, that one from the dead might instruct
his brethren), God raised vp Lazarus, the brother
of Mary Magdalen, who might witnesse and testifie as
much as Christ had reported: I will not stand vpon the

truth of this traditon; though certaine it is, that both
these accidents fell out much about the same time. The
very bones of the dead, being serued vp at a banket, wil
bee a fit sauce to season our immoderate mirth: the
tombes of the dead are for the instruction of the liuing,
monumenta monent mentem, we tread vpon the flesh of
our forefathers, which is now become the dust of the
Temple. Death is an excellent meanes to stirre vp pietie,
and deuotion: the mariners in guiding their ships,
must sit in the end, to hold and gouerne the stearne; and
the end of euerything, is the first in intension, though
the last in execution. Hence it is, that the religious persons
in al ages, were frequentes in cemiterijs, alwaies busily
imploied about the tombes of the dead: their cloysters
of recreation were places of burials for their meditation;
if they found themselues giuen to immoderate
ioy, their delight was abated with the sight &amp; smell
of dead bones. Thus liuing they were dead, their mind
was among the dead, they conuersed with the dead:
and thus the meditation of death, did prescribe vnto
them (answerable to a vale of miserie, befitting a sinfull
state) a course of life in mortification and sorrow.
            O death, which doest astonish man with thy sight,
how fearefull is thy blow! when wee shall goe and neuer
returne, or recouer our owne strength; Soles occidere
&amp; redire possunt, at nobis nox perpetua dormienda
est. O death, which in this last age of the world, (wherin
sinne and iniquitie doe abound, and religion seemes
to haue taken vp wings, and euery where to bee put to
flight, and indeede to haue gone vp to heauen, from
whence she descended) yet death stands like a stoute
champion to fight in defence of religion; death stands
at the backe of religion,Death 
                     •
                  ights in defence of religion. assuring vs that there must bee
an end of this sinful state, and of these worldly vanities,
and death is this end, assuring vs, that there must be a

time for the manifestation of Gods iustice, and death
seemes to summon vs, to appeare at his iudgement seat;
assuring vs, that there is another world to succeede, and
death is the passage to that other world: for otherwise
in vaine should wee preach the mercie of God, together
with his promises; in vaine should we teach the
law of nature, the instinct of nature, the moral precepts,
the mysteries of grace, the maiestie of God; in vaine
should wee preach humilitie, to sustaine iniuries with
patience, to forgiue all offences, to make restitution for
wrongs; in vaine should wee perswade men, to spend
whole nights in watchings, fastings, and prayers, to repent
in sackcloth and ashes: alas, alas, these are all vnprofitable
lessons to the worldlings, let vs therefore leauing
the force of Church discipline, Ecclesiasticall censures,
Excommunications, &amp;c. let vs implore brachium
seculare, the helpe of the temporall power to restraine
sinne. Remember thine owne death, remember thine
owne death; if thou wilt not forsake the world, the
world shall at length forsake thee; here is our last refuge,
to serue at a dead lift, for the conuersion of a sinner;
here is no faith of things inuisible, here are no strict
rules of mortification, here are no precepts, which seeme
to oppose the practise of mans naturall inclination: but
consider the state of thine owne body, and the degrees
of thine age, how thou doest daily decline, and learne
to dye by the daily precedent, experience, and example
of others: Filimi memorare nouissima &amp; in aeternum non
peribis; My sonne, remember thy last end, and thou
shalt neuer perish euerlastingly.
            As it serues for a meanes of our conuersion, so is it no
lesse cause of great ioy and comfort to a well resolued
Christian;The Christian man desires death as the meane of his happinesse. 
               Cupio dissolui, &amp; esse cum Christo: Life is the
only hinderance of our coupling with Christ; this old
house must first bee taken downe, before the new building

can be erected: now death serues as a bridge or a
passage to a better life; it is a holie relique, which first
seazed vpon Christs bodie, and at length shall befall vs;
we must dye with him, that wee may raigne with him;
where the head hath already entred, the whole bodie
must follow. But here is our comfort, hee that stood in
the forefront, hath now abated the strength of our aduersarie;
he that sanctified all other creatures, the earth
with his blood, the ayre purified with his breath, the
water washt with his washing, the fire purged with his
spirit in fierie tongues, he hath likewise sanctified death
it selfe by his owne death. Death is now made a safe
harbour vnto vs, which before was the terrour of nature:
for as it was truly prophecied of Christ, so is it
verified in the members of Christ, He shall not leaue his
soule in hell, nor suffer his holy one to see corruption. Thus
is death now become the sole sacrifice of a Christian
man,Death is the sacrifice of our selues. a free oblation at Gods altar, wherein whole man
is bequeathed vnto God; wee commit our soules to his
safe custodie and keeping, wee leaue our bodies to be
the dust of his Temple: all our goods we dispose as he
shall direct vs, some by the course of nature, which hee
himselfe hath appointed; some to pious and religious
vses, which hee himselfe hath commanded; some to
almes-deedes and charitable beneuolence, according
to that natural compassionate instinct, which God hath
imprinted in our hearts, and as the present necessitie of
these times seemes to require: and what is so left, wee
leaue it not behind vs, but it followes vs, and ouertakes
vs at heauen gates. And thus is man become a whole
burnt offering vnto God, and that by the meanes of his
death: and therefore we may now securely triumph ouer
death, O death where is thy sting! O hell where is thy
victorie! the sting of death is sinne, the strength of sinne is
the law: but thankes be vnto God who hath giuen vs victorie,

through our Lord Iesus Christ.
            
            Death is the sole comfort in all my worldly miseries,
for it seemes to be the vpshot and period of my woe:
which if I shal once attaine (as needs I must attaine),
then shall I be like the sea faring man, who being arriued
in the Hauen, hath safely escaped the troublesome
waues of this turbulent world; the assurance and expectation
whereof,Death is our comfort in all our worldly miseri
                     •
                  s. doth inable me with patience, and forti
                  •
               ude.
For what can befall me? Suppose losse of senses,
losse of limbes, losse of substance, losse of honour; yet
one thing remaines, I shall dye, I shall dye; here is my
comfort, for here is the end of my woe. What if the bloodie
Tyrant shall sport himselfe, in the shedding of my
innocent blood? what if the great states-man shall pick
out some flawes, and finde out some nice errors in my
estate, and thereby vnder the faire shew of concealements,
shall make me a bootie? Sentiat hoc, moriar,
mors vltima linea rerum. My life is a pilgrimage, the
quicker my expedition is, I shall sustaine the lesse sorrow.
Now this contempt of death, giues the true Christian
man such an excellent spirit, such a braue courage
and resolution,Death giues the Chris

                  a

                   man an excellent resolutiō. as that indeede he proues the only good
souldier; thou maiest repose confidence in him, for he
will neuer reuolt, or forsake a iust cause; in his attempts
thou shalt finde him valiant aboue measure, for this resolution
of death is his armour of proofe, for conquer
hee will, and conquer he must, though with his owne
passion; fearefull and terrible hee is to his enemies, for
hee that regards not his owne life, is Lord of another
mans life. Whereas the worldling, who hath placed all
his happinesse here in the course of this life, is indeed a
base coward, fearefull, vnfaithfull, performing his seruice
onely to the outward shew, carrying a heart full of
infidelitie; vpon all fit occasions he is ready to reuolt,
and dares vndertake nothing for feare of his death,

which hee holds for his greatest woe.
            Thus I haue proportioned the seuerall punishments
of the first sinne, to the tenne plagues of Egypt: I haue
contracted them to the number of tenne, though further
happily I could haue extended them; were it not
that I desire to speake al things, according to some rule
and proportion. But now I call to minde, the last punishment
in Egypt was, mors primogeniti,
               The first and second death. the death of
their first begotten; and this hath likewise some reference
to the last punishment of sinne, mors primogeniti,
the death of the soule, which is the first begotten in
man: and Scripture doth intimate as much in effect, for
this very phrase, morte morieris, thou shalt dye the
death, might seeme to include a needlesse repetition, or
tautologie; were there not a first death, and a second
death, and both of them brused, brayed and beaten together
in this one morter, morte morieris, thou shalt dye
the death. Which words 
                  •
               ound to my eares, as if they
did intimate the truth of a double death, both proposed
to man, and man himselfe made subiect and liable to
both; yet the necessitie seemes to be imposed, only for
one. The first iudgment hath relation to the first death,
thou shalt dye the death: if you tell me of the Hebrew
phrase, and the manner of their speech, then I doe much
more magnifie God, who hath so ordained the tongues
and languages of men, to expresse such a mysterie.
            If you please to consider the circumstances and 
                  •
               orerunners
of the last and generall iudgement, they cannot
but greatly astonish man:The fearefull circumstances of the last iudgement. when the world shall now
be growne to that old age, as that her sight shall begin
to faile her; or sicke of a dangerous and desperate disease,
vndoubtedly approching to death, her light shall
be put out, (which was the first token and signe of life,
and therefore was created in the first place), when the
Sunne and the Moone shall be darkened; and in this

darknesse, as if nature were poysoned with mans sinne,
not any part thereof shall be able to performe her owne
office and dutie, but all shall stand in an vprore, the heauens
with the elements, the elements with the heauens,
and all together confounded. Luk. 21. vers. 25. Then there shall be signes in the Sunne, and in the Moone, and
in the Starres, and vpon the earth trouble among the nations
with perplexitie, the Sea and the waters shall roare,
&amp;c. These things might seeme strange and terrible to
the carnall man, but here is the least part of his terrour;
for when hee shall see the wrath of God hanging ouer
his head, hell opened beneath him, damnation before
him, his persecuting foes behind him, on his right hand
the whole number of his sinnes accusing him, on the
left hand all the creatures witnessing against him, within
him nothing but feare, tormenting himselfe with
the sting of his owne conscience, without him nothing
but torture, and the crie of his owne sinnes, together
with Gods iustice calling for vengeance: O what a
fearefull thing it is to fall into the hands of the euer liuing
God! When as al the plagues of Egypt, which certainly
were strange and wonderfull; yet by the confession
of the Egyptians, and by the testimonie of Scripture
it selfe, were onely wrought by the finger of God,
digitus dei hic est: alas what proportion is there betweene
the whole hand, and the little finger. But shall
I tell you how to to auoide the hands of this euerliuing
God;How wee should preuent Gods wrath. then let vs first fall into the hands of a dead God,
amor meus crucifixus est, Christus meus crucifixus est:
his blood is shed, and therefore he will not require our
blood; he is weakened, and cannot hurt; his hands are
nailed, and cannot strike, he is not fit to punish, but to

feare, and vnder the shadow of his wings we shal

                finde
protection. Hebr. 4. vers. 15. 16. Wee haue not an high

Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, but was in all things tempted in like sort, yet
without sinne: let vs therfore goe boldly vnto the throne
of grace, that we may receiue mercie, and finde grace to
helpe vs in this time of our necessitie.
            
            Let vs call to minde,What effects the meditation of the last iudgemēt hath wrought vpon many. what effects the preuision and
premeditation of this last and great iudgement, hath
wrought vpon the dearest Saints of God: the righteous
Iob can testifie in the 21. Chapter; What shall I doe? how
shall I escape, when God shall come vnto iudgement? The
beloued Disciple, though otherwise he had leaned vpon
the bosome of Christ; yet seeing Christ comming in
iudgement, he fell downe vnder his feete, Apocal. 1. S. Ierome
sets vp a stage, and makes a liuely representation
of this iudgement, supposing himselfe alwaies to heare
the noyse of the trumpet sounding in his eares, Surgite
mortui, venite ad iudieiū: Arise ye dead, come vnto iudgment.
S. Basill lets foorth this iudgement, in place of a
schoole-master to teach vs our selues, and our owne
wretched condition. S. Chrysostome makes it a bridle
to keepe vs from sinne, within the lists of obedience.
Cyprian makes it a remembrancer of sinne, for our repentance▪
               Vaepeccatis meis, cum monti dicturus sum, &amp;c.
Woe be vnto my sinnes, when I shall say to the mountaines,
couer me; and to the deepe waters, hide and conceale me;
to the earth, swallow and ouerwhelme me, that I may find
some refuge in the day of Gods wrath. Whither shall I
goe from Gods presence? if I flie vp to heauen, hee is
there; if I goe downe into hell, he is there also; if I take
vp the wings of a Doue, and flie to the vttermost parts
of the earth, euen there also shall his power follow me,
and his iustice pursue mee: whither shall I flie from
Gods presence? I will flie from God to God, from the
tribunall of his iustice, to the seate of his mercie; here
is my appeale, Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender

mercie and thy louing kindnesse, which haue been euer of
old: O remember not the sinnes and offences of my youth,
but according to thy mercie, thinke thou vpon me, O
Lord, for thy goodnesse.
            
            Thus much for the expectation: but I dare not proceede
to the tortures and torments of hell; S. Austine
excuseth himselfe, in speaking of that subiect, and for
my selfe, I am afraid to thinke of them: and therefore I
pray' beare with me, if I follow S. Austins example, I
had rather sound foorth the trumpets of Gods mercie,
then poure downe the viols of his wrath: God preuent

take to manifest his mercie, for God himselfe hath appointed
my saluation, not to consist in not sinning, or
to be free and innocent from all sinnes; but in the repentance
for sinne, and in the satisfaction of his deare
Sonne: and therefore to assure mee of this mercie, it is

one of the Articles of my Creed (which not to beleeue
were not to be saued), that I should bouldlie and confidently
beleeue the remission and forgiuenesse of sins. Yet
conceiue me aright, for some there are who laying
hould to soone on Gods mercy, as it were snatching at
his mercy, do indeed loose the fruits of his mercy; when
(laying the whole burthen of their sins vpon Christ, as
it were making long and deepe furrowes in his backe)
themselues continuing in their owne sinnes, in the impenitency
and hardnesse of their owne hearts, do indeed
dreame of saluation.
            My sinnes are innumerable, yet before I was borne,
before they could be committed, God did foresee them;
notwithstanding his foresight,Antidotes against desperation. when hee might haue
preuented my sinnes, and left me to my first nothing,
yet in his gratious goodnes and mercie, hee made and
created me: he hath giuen me my life, my strength, my
health, my senses, my wit, and al my temporall blessings,
together with the knowledge of himselfe, the plentifull
and powerful meanes of my saluation; notwithstanding
my sinnes, be they neuer so great, yet these are the tokens
of his fauour, the pledges of his loue, the assurances
of his promises, and the earnest of my future happines.
Why should I then despaire of Gods mercy? though I
haue lost that sanctitie and holinesse, wherewith I
might be saued, yet God hath not lost that vertue and
powe, 
                  •
                wherewith he might saue a penitent sinner; and
behold the fruit of this power, if I do but speake or
name God, it is God that speakes in my heart, ipse praesens
facit se quaeri, I had thought I had lost him, but behold
he is present, and inuites me to a banquet, where
he himselfe is the feast, conui

not worthy with the dogs, to licke vp the crummes vnder
thy table; yet giue me O Lord that property of dogs, that
licking mine owne woundes, I might heale mine owne

sores, that my tongue may serue to cleanse my vncleannes;
confessing my sinnes, I may disgorge and cast out my sins,
where they shall lie as a heauie burthen vpon thy sonne, for
he hath taken vp my sinnes, and borne mine iniquities; my
sinnes are no longer mine, Mea sunt per perpetrationem,

committed them, and so they are mine, but Christ alone
hath entred into bands for the discharge of them; he hath
canceld the hand writing of the lawe, he hath satisfied
the rigour of thy iustice, by the shedding of his bloud, by
his death and passion; and therefore O Lord, thou wilt
not demand a second payment of vs; he hath imputed his
righteousnesse to vs, and thus euery true penitent, stands

            Giue me leaue to compare my selfe, that am the meanest
of all men, to Alexander the great; and this my
present treatise,A transition from the death of man, to the death of the whole world. wherein I labour to shew the fall and
corruption of man, to the conquest of nature; me thinks
I haue subdued the little world, and brought man as a
captiue or sl
                  •
               ue, through much misery and sorrow, at
length to the place of his execution; and hauing now
possest my selfe of the fairest fortresse, or tower in nature
(man that is a little world), I cannot here content
my selfe, but I begin to enquire, whether there are as
yet more worlds to be conquered? and behold in the
second place, I will fall vpon the great world, and I
will attempt with Archimedes, to shake her foundations,
to threaten her ruine, in this generall corruption
and dissolution of man: for this punishment (morte morieris)
though it principally concernes man, yet the
whole world cannot be exempted from it, being directed
and ordained onely for mans vse, containing in it
selfe the very same seedes, and causes of death and destruction;
and as it is most fit and agreeable to our present
condition, that being corruptible in our selues, we

should likewise dwell in houses of corruption.
            For proofe and demonstration wherof, I must ascend
from the indiuiduals and singulars, to the species and
kindes of the creatures; and among all other kindes,The kinds and species of creatures do decay.
assuredly man is the most noble, and therfore best deserues
to be the subiect of our knowledge: wee should
be best acquainted with our selues, which makes for the
certainty of our knowledge; and speaking of things
which so neerely concernes our selues, we should much
desire to bee better informed, in our owne state and
condition: now if the whole kinde and species of man
seemes daily to decline and decay, which shall appeare
by the comparison of times past with times present; of
our selues, with our ancestors; then assuredly the whole
world cannot be excused from corruption; but as it dies
daily in the singulars, so at length it shall faile in the vniuersals,
and in the kindes of the creatures.
            This truth seemes to relie vpon these three foundations:
1. Man (as all other creatures) being immediatlie
created by God,Three reasons why all the creatures doe decline. as he comes nearer and nearer the first
mould, so is he more and more perfect, and according
to the degrees of his distance, so he incurres the more
imperfection and weakenesse; as the streames of a fountaine,
the further they runne through vncleane passages,
the more they contract the corruption. 2. It would
implie a contradiction in nature, if the parts and the
whole were not of like condition; but how wonderfull
is the difference, if you will suppose a corruption of the
singulars, and an eternitie of the kinde? for whereas the
recompence shuld be made by succession or equiualencie,
we must consider, that succession may well prolong
the corruption, adding more degrees, proceeding more
leasurely, but cannot wholie exclude the corruption.
3. The generall intent and scope of nature wholie

                  •
               ends to corruption; for I would gladly aske, why should

not nature, either renew mans age, or preserue him in
a state of consistencie? the answere is, because the iuyce
and sap which we receiue from our food, or our nourishment,
is not so agreeable to the state of our bodies,
as is that humor, &amp; calor radicalis, which wee receiue
from our first birth; heere I will reply, how fals it out,
that our bodies should impart semen ad procreandum,
wherin that radicall humor is resident? and (both seede
and humor arising from our food and our nourishment)
yet nature should seeme in the preseruation of our bodies,
to refuse the best, making it an excrement of the
third concoction, and taking for her owne foode and
sustenance, the worst part of the substance. See then, the
generall intent and scope of nature tending to corruption,
must likewise argue that nature her selfe in generall,
shall at length be tainted with the same corruption.
            First for the apparell of the Ancients, if you please to
obserue the fashion of their garments, you shall finde
them to be such,The clothing and apparell of the Ancients compared with ours. as (no way inforcing nature, nor made
onely for comlinesse) they might best serue for the exercise
of the agilitie of their bodies: which well argues
a greater actiuity in them then in vs, though I suppose
they would not suffer any, to practise for danger, much
lesse to get a dishonest liuing, by vaulting, tumbling, or
any such apish toyes; yet generally they were more
actiue, and had lesse vse of horses, then we haue in these
dayes. For the substance of their garments, our clothing
is much more gentle, and soft then theirs, for they had
not that vse of linnen which we haue; which well argues
the weaknes and tendernes of our flesh, in respect
of theirs; their garments being courser, were likewise
much weightier and heauier then ours, which b
                  •
                t
                  •
               kens
the strong foundation of their bodies, for in these dayes
wee could hardly indure their burthen or weight; it

should seeme, they did accustome themselues to much
hardnesse, for amongst the common sort of men, stockings
and shooes were not then grown into fashion: indeed
for the trunke or bulke of their bodies, they were
more warmely clothed then wee are, as committing
themselues more to the weather; and as the heate of a
mans owne body, being kept in with warme clothes, is
much more naturall, more healthfull and cordiall to
man, then is the burning, scorching and consuming
heate of the fire; therefore the Ancients did more desire
warme clothes and apparell, then the vse of fire; for among
them you shall finde little preparation for fire,
their houses built with very fewe chymnies, they were
very sparing and thriftie in their woods, their chambers
very close and warme, desiring rather to keepe out the
cold winde, then to let in the fresh ayre; whereas our
wantonnes appeares in large windowes &amp; high roofes,
as if we made no difference of being without doores,
and being within doores; or that we did neuer purpose
to vse our limbes, to goe and take the fresh ayre, but
that the fresh ayre should be brought vnto vs; their lying
or bedding was very hard, few of them knew what
feather-beds meant, and assuredly their bodies would
better indure it then ours;The Ancients more giuen to their sports then now we are. as likewise for their lodging
in campes, or professing a strict and austere life, as many
religious men did; and as they were more apt for their
labours, so were they more giuen to their pastimes, their
sports and their games then we are; which I suppose
did neither argue lightnesse in them, nor any counterfeit
grauitie in vs, but the state of their bodies were
such as did require them, and the weaknenesse of our
bodies is such, as we dare not attempt them, for according
to the disposition of the body the minde is affected.
            From the apparell let vs come to the foode, now it

should seeme is the ould age of the world, which appeares
by the pampering of our selues; for take our ordinary
foode, it was neuer heretofore so delicat, so daintie,
so tender,Our food compared with the food of the Ancients. as it is at this day, the vsuall, ould, and accustomed
food not agreeing with our weak stomackes:
we must haue warme and delicious brothes to comfort
our decayed nature, exquisite sauces to prouoke our
appetite, such purboyling, such helpes and remedies of
art to prepare our meates for digestion; which assuredly
do wel argue, that the world is either dangerously
sicke, or come to her ould age, that she should be inforced
to vse, or indeed can admit such a physicall diet.
For during the strength of nature, while things were in
their perfection, a stronger foode did better be fit them,
&amp; did more agree with their bodies; cookerie was then
wholy vnknowne, they could be content with the bare
vse of the creatures, without any further delicacy or
preparation; water did then serue for their drinke, and
they did feede much vpon hearbes, milch-meates and
course bread; as the world grew elder, so they did daily
more &amp; more decline in the strength of their nature;
fasting and eating of fish in succeeding ages, did not so
well agree with the state of their bodies, and therefore
you shall finde euen in Church-discipline, a greater conniuencie,
toleration, and dispensation vpon any reasonable
cause; and we, that are now falne in this last period
of times, we are now growne to that faintnesse, that
hot waters, and strong drinkes, were neuer so much vsed,
hot spices were neuer brought ouer in such plentie,
as may well appeare in the custome-house: yea such is
the continuall weaknesse of our stomackes,The vse of Tobacco in these dayes. that for remedy
and helpe thereof, this last age hath found out an
Indian drug (the vse of Tobacco) which at all times, vpō
all occasions, to all complexions, the full stomacke, the
emptie stomacke, in any measure or quantitie taken,

must serue to cure the rawnesse of the stomack; to extenuate
and exhale the ill humors, to help the vndigested
foode; but you will say, that the vse, or at least the immoderat
vse of this hearbe, proceeds from the wantonnesse
of these times, which truely I do easily confesse;
yet assuredly the temper and constitution of our bodies,
would neuer admit such a wantonnes, were it not, that
it proceeds from the weaknesse of our nature: for if wee
should presume as far vpon hearbes in the extremity of
coldnesse, suppose the iuyce of Oranges or Limons
(which by the art and cunning of man, might bee made
euery way as delicious and delicate), certainely wee
should feele the smart of our owne follie.
            The clothing and foode doe much betoken the
soundnesse and constitution of our bodies, yet I cannot
content my selfe with them, but I will descend to
speake more immediately of our bodies:Heretofore the constitution of mens bodies was better thē now it is. it should seeme
that death is not onely competent to euery person in
particular, but euen the whole world, and all the seuerall
kindes of creatures tend to confusion; there is a
great decay in euery species, men come not to that
strength, nor to that growth, nor to that ripenesse of
wit, nor to that fulnesse of yeeres which they did in former
times; the world hath his period and his determinate
course of yeeres: now is the olde age or decay of
this world. The growth and strength of men seeme to
proceede from the same causes, and to relie vpon the
same foundation (the bones), which according to their
massinesse, their weight, or their length giue the proportion
and strength to the whole bodie; these bones
are yet extant, and are daylie taken vp in sepulchers,
whereof I haue often been an eye-witnesse, and hauing
duely considered them according to measure and
weight, I finde by most vndoubted experience, that
they did far exceede ours; their weapons will likewise

testifie as much, for these are yet extant, and are reserued
as relikes and trophies of their valour, which the
strength of man in these dayes cannot mannage or rule;
many things there are likewise, wherein I could instance,
which were (in former times) trialls for their
strength, but now seeme very impossible to our weakenesse.
Consider all their actions which they did vndertake,
for therein they did as farre exceede vs, as their
strength did exceede ours; obserue their attempts in erecting
stately Cathedrall Churches for the exercise of
Religion, in building huge Castles for defence of their
people, in contriuing high waies, caus-waies, bridges, &amp;
such like, which well betoken noble and braue spirits:
whereas our wits in these daies make their imployments
in things of lesse moment, some prettie toyes
and trifles, some new fashion and attire; our buildings
are paper-buildings, made onely to serue the present
vse and occasion. I am ashamed of our selues, we doate,
we doate; though herein I doe acknowledge a wonderfull
prouidence of God, while the world had some
time of continuance,Gods prouidence in mans actions. when the yeeres were not fully
expired, then God gaue man a minde and disposition to
intend the good of posteritie: but now in these latter
daies, when the world is almost come to an vpshot,
when the period of time is now approching; no marueile
if God leaue man to himselfe, that out of his own
immoderate loue of himselfe, neglecting the common
good, and the good of succession, he should onely intend,
in his buildings, in the waste of his woods, and in
all other his actions, his owne priuate and present commoditie.
            Very credible it is, that their grear labours and actiōs
were more performed by their own only strength,A great change doth appeare in mans owne disposition.
for they had lesse vse of instruments, and craines in their
buildings, notwithstanding their huge foundations,

then we haue at this day. But I will not insist in the particular
actions; rather this decay of nature, shall appeare
in the general disposition and inclination of men,
together with the diseases whereunto they are subiect:
that a change should appeare in the very nature, and instinct
of man, after so great a change in his temper and
constitution, I am the rather perswaded to beleeue;
when I consider how many titles, paragraphes, what
large discourses, and iudgements haue past in the Ciuill
lawes, concerning the adoption of sonnes; whereof at
this day we finde little, or no vse, being lawes which seldome
or neuer come to the practise. Certainly as the
children of Israel were most carefull, to preserue their
tribes whole and entire, vntill the comming of their
Messias; and as the Patriarkes were most carefull, as of
their succession and seede, so of their dead bones; for
Iacob gaue charge, that his dead body should be carried
out of Egypt (as it were going to Ierusalem in pilgrimage),
there to be laid &amp; rest, neere the holy Sepulcher:
but since the comming of Christ, you shall finde
that their tribes are confounded, and in themselues you
shall finde no such inclination. So was it in the ancient
Romanes, as long as this world had any time to continue,
how carefull were they of succession,The adoption of sonnes. if not from
their owne loynes, yet by their owne adoption, for the
continuance of their names and memories? but now
the world is almost come to an vpshot, see the strange
change and alteration, a change in our nature! for nature
will neuer faile in her ends and purposes: and therfore
to desire a continuance of memorie, when the
world it selfe shall haue no time of continuance, it cannot
stand with the wisedome and prouidence of nature,
which hath ingrafted in vs our naturall inclination.
            To shew the change of mens mindes, let vs change

our profession, à togis ad arma, from the penne to the
speare, from the barre to the campe: Where is that ancient
resolution of the Romanes, who desired nothing
more,The resolution of the Anciēts. then to sow the seede of their owne blood in defence
of their countrey, thereby expecting the eternitie
of their names and memories? Infinite are the examples
which may be brought to this purpose: but wee on the
contrarie supposing (as it were by an implicite faith)
some naturall instinct, that the world shall not continue
the full age of a man; we thinke our blood better saued,
and reserued within the vessels of our owne bodies,
then wastfully spent in a vaine expectation of honour
and fame, after our deaths. And this I conceiue to bee
the reason, that cowardize &amp; feare hath now at leng
                  •
               h
poss
                  •
               ssed our mindes, in stead of the braue resolution
and courage of former times; it was thē thought fit by
the wisdome of our lawes, to permit a triall by combats
and duels,Triall by combats. as well befitting a warlike nation, which notwithstanding
at this day, if they be not wholly abolished
(not knowing how things may hereafter succeed, or
what vse there might bee of such combats vpon some
occasions), yet assuredly they cease in the practise.
            Let not this change of our mindes seeme strange vnto
you; for see you not, how the little chickens stand
fearefull of the Kite, whereas the valiant Cocke desires
nothing more then the combat? In young men and old
men you shall not finde a like inclination: and men of
diuers nations you shal finde them seuered, as in their
climates, so in their dispositions. Suppose a change
should appeare in the naturall inclination of man; it is
no more then you may discene in other creatures: hereafter
as man shall finde out new snares to intrap them,There may be a change in the naturall instinct.
assuredly nature giues thē an instinct accordingly for
their own preseruation, as desiring to cōtinue the same
kinde which was created from the beginning. As for

example, Gun-powder is a late inuention of mans, a
cruell and mercilesse instrument; therefore hath God
giuen them a sent and a smell, for their owne safetie and
defence: and as the making and vse of it, is a late inuention
of ours, so the auoiding &amp; discouering of it, is a late
inuentiō of theirs, that so there might appeare as great a
prouidence, goodnesse, and power of God in their preseruation,
as there was in their first creation.
            From the change in our mindes, let vs come to the
change in the soundnesse and constitution of our bodies:
Considering their strength in former times,The Ancients were not so subiect to diseases, as wee are. certainly
they were lesse subiect to diseases, then now wee
are; for thus the old age of the world, as it is a weaknes
in it selfe, so is it accompanied with many infirmities.
This may well appeare by their little vse of physicke;
for in ancient times, the common sort of men being
wholly vnacquainted with physicall receipts, they suffered
nature to worke her owne will, and did not ouerloade
their stomackes, with drugges and potions: not
a hundred yeeres since, the Physitian, the Apothecarie
and the Surgion, did seeme to belong to one and the
same calling and profession of men; but now the necessitie
of the times inforcing vs, the Physitian containes
himselfe within the bounds of his knowledge, prescribes
his receipts, and giues his direction; the Druggist
hee turnes an Apothecarie, distils his waters, and
makes his confections; the Barber he proues a Surgion,
with his plaisters and salues, searching the wounds, and
the bones. Here are three distinct and seuerall courses
of life, all set on worke, and all sufficiently employed:
the Physitians haue their Colledge, the Surgions their
Hall, (Henry the 8. gaue the first Charters to both, and
that within our memorie); and the Apothecaries are
now verie earnest and busie to make themselues a
whole entire Companie, forsooth a new Corporation,

the more is our miserie and sorrow.
            For the difference of diseases; the Ancients were more
inclined to hot diseases, such as proceede from the
strength of nature, and doe accompanie youth, then we
are; as plagues, sweating-sicknesses, plurisies, and all other
infectious diseases arising from heate, wherein the
blood is inflamed: so likewise the inclination of men
to their lusts, arising from the constitution of their bodies,
was then much greater then now, (though I doe
easily yeeld, that the wantonnesse of these daies farre
exceeds theirs),The Ancients more apt to ingender. this appeares by the number of Salomons
Concubines; for then the world was to bee peopled,
and their disposition to their lusts was so strong,
as that God out of the idulgencie of his owne mercie,
did permit a polygamie. This appeares likewise in
the dumbe creatures; for the alteration of so many
kindes, such numbers &amp; varietie of different creatures
did only proceed out of the immoderate heate, which
causeth the ingendring &amp; coupling together of cōtrary
kinds: for assuredly in the Arke al those seuerall kinds
were not contained, but since haue sprung vp from the
mixture of kindes. So at this day the Southerne people,
propter ftatum &amp; calorem, are more inclined to their
lust, though the Northerne people, propter abundantiam
seminis, may se
                  •
               me to equall them; yet of both, the Southerne
are more vicious, because the vice it selfe ariseth
rathe
                  •
                from heate and wantonnesse, then from necessitie.
But generally, as was their strength greater in former
times, so were their infirmities lesse, especially such
as proceed from the weaknesse and coldnesse of nature,
and herein we seeme most to abound: for proofe wherof,
there are many diseases onely proper to these times,
such as were vnknowne to the Ancients; I could name
many, but I will onely iusist in the French or Neapolitane
disease, which though it be accompanied sometimes

with a great vnnaturall heate,New diseases proceeding from coldnesse and weaknes. yet certainly it resides
in pituita crassa; it may be long harboured in the
bodie before it discouers it selfe, and works so leisurely
by degrees, as cannot stand with the efficacie of hea
                  •
               e;
and therfore it must be a cold disease, and argue a great
measure of naturall coldnesse and weakenesse, such as
their bodies in former times could neuer admit.
            From the diseases and infirmities arising out of the
naturall constitution of our bodies, let vs come to the
cure:The difference betweene the Ancients and vs, in the cures of our diseases. The physicke of former times agrees with ours, as
in the receipts, so for the dosis and quantitie; thus wee
haue the practise, and experience of al ages: and though
(I suppose) that their drugges in former times were of
farre greater strength and efficacie then ours, (for so I
conceiue that the world is in the declining); yet must
it follow, that in all things it should carrie a like proportion,
as farre foorth as possibly it could, the difference
should appeare alike; as in the drugges, so in mans
body. Now in this confusion, how shall wee discerne
the variety of times? I will therfore prescribe this course
for our direction: Certaine it is, that we haue the same
dosis, the same measures and weights, for so they agree
in all our receipts: now take our bodies with the physicke
ioyntly together, and then they will keepe their
proportion; but seuer them, and them, shall appeare the
disparitie. Most sure it is, that in the 
                  •
               etting of blood,
which is done according to measure, the Ancients did
vsually take sixe or seuen times as much, as they doe in
these daies: a strange difference, I confesse, and yet vndoubtedly
a truth, for Galen relates it, &amp;c.
            From the diseases I will come to the death of both,
if you please to giue me first leaue to speake a word or
two, concerning the inward gifts of our mindes;The wits of former times did exceede ours. for the
wits of former times, certainly they did farre exceede
ours, their bodies were better tempered, as being neerer

the first mould, and the minde followes the temper
and disposition of the bodie; though I confesse, that
this our age being most proud, arrogant and vaineglorious,
doth most vniustly claime vnto it selfe the
name and title of the learned age; shall we ascribe no
more to the first founders and inuentors of Arts? Was
it a worke of small difficultie to hew and square out
nature, allotting to euery Science her proper subiect,
her due limitation? to reduce all the seuerall starres into
constellations, to obserue their motion, their qualitie,
their influence? Grammar, which is the first entrance,
and the meanest of all Arts, seemes to bee most
excellent in her inuention; that all the seuerall words,
how different soeuer, in sound and signification, should
be comprehended in an alphabet of foure and twentie
letters; that cases, declensions, numbers, tenses, and the
like, should figure out the varietie of nature. For all
Arts whatsoeuer, the best authors are the most ancient,
euen vnto this day: I could instance in euery one in particular,
though wee building vpon their foundations,
haue added some ornaments, yet such as are not necessarie
to perfit the Art: and generally for the Ancients,
whatsoeuer you shal obserue in practise amongst them,
you shall finde that it stood with great wisedome and
prouidence, if you please to haue relation to the times
and occasions. And wherein they seeme to be defectiue,
you may ascribe it to the happinesse of their times; for
their plentie was such, as that they were not inforced to
trie all conclusions in husbandrie, whereas our wants
seeme to require our best inuentions; their honest
plaine and charitable meaning was such, as that they
were vnacquainted, or at least thought it not fit, to discouer
the guile and subtiltie of a serpentine generation;
the hardnesse of their bodies, their feare of God, and
the ioy of his seruice was such, as that vtterly detesting

all carnalitie, (searing least the glory and pompe of this
world, might steale away themselues from themselues,
and that they might be carried with an immoderat loue
to the creatures), they thought it fitter to preuent this
mischiefe in the root, to professe a more homely and
strict kinde of life, and therein to giue themselues contentment;
that so their time and leisure might better
serue them, for the practise of zeale and deuotion.
            But this great learned age hath found out a comparison,
wherin we might seeme to magnifie the Ancients,
but indeed very cunningly do presse them downe,A foolish comparison answered. making
them our foote-stooles; preferring our selues before
them, extolling and exalting our selues aboue measure;
for thus it is said, that we are like dwarfes set vpon
shoulders of Gyants, discerning little of our selues, but
supposing the learning and ground-worke of the Ancients,
we see much further then they, (which in effect is
as much, as that we prefer our own iudgements, before
theirs): in truth, in truth, a very wittie comparison, certainely
it is either a dwarfe or a Gyant, for it will admit
no mediocrity. But I pray' let vs examine it, though
(I confesse) that comparisons are not alwayes the best
proofes; first how these dwarfes should be exhaled and
drawne vp to the shoulders of the gyants; here is a point
of great difficulty as yet not thought vpon, 
                  •
               or I must
tell you my iudgement: as in digging the earth some
mettals are found, and some are vndiscouered, so is it in
reading and perusing the workes of the fathers; we may
continually learne, and daily finde out new mynes in
their writings; suppose these dwarfes to bee now set
vpon the shoulders; it is to bee feared, least seeing so
steepe a descent, they will rather fall to a giddines, then
be able rightly to iudge of the obiects, least they should
be confounded with the multiplicity of learning in the
fathers, not able to fadome the depth of their grounds;

for wil you suppose, that these Gyants should so infinitly
exceed the dwarfes in length and in strength, and yet
will you equall them for goodnes and quicknes of
sight? I cannot stay long vpon the shoulders of Gyants,
for heere is but slippery hold; nor yet vpon the feete of
comparisons, for these are but weake grounds and
proofes; let this one reason suffice, it is a difference betweene
actions voluntary and naturall; that in voluntary
(such as are the actions of the vnderstanding) no
man can worke according to the vttermost of his power,
but when hee hath once spoken, hee may speake againe
and againe as much to the purpose; so that hee
which shall make himselfe perfect in an other mans
worke,The small account which some make of the Fathers. yet can neuer therein so fully informe himselfe
as the Author. This difference likewise appeares in
God, whose vnderstanding being natural and essential,
hee vnderstanding and comprehending himselfe, doth
beget a word euery way equal to himselfe: but suppose
(I pray') that these gyants should stumble or fall, take
heede of the dwarfe, take heede of the dwarfe, nay rather
cries out the dwarfe, I will guide and direct them,
and keepe them from falling; if they will not vphold
me, then I will vphold them. Here is presumption in
deede; here you shall see some expurgatorie index, apostasia
patrum, errores conciliorum, lapsus ecclesiae; see
here what great account they make of the Fathers, and
thus they can vse arguments to serue all turnes and occasions.
            I am the more strict to iustifie the wits and learning
of the ancient Fathers, because (I suppose) it maks much
for the certaintie and dignitie of Christian religion;It cannot stād with the dignity of Christian religion to forsake the Fathers.
that our faith tooke no aduantage by other mens ignorance,
to spread it selfe, and to get growth in the
blindnesse of error: but at the time of Christs birth, all
the liberall Arts did most florish, there was a generall

peace thorough the whole world, the Romane Empire
fully setled, and established, Poets, Orators, Philosophers,
Historians neuer more excellent. For thus it stood
with the prouidence of God, that their wits and qualities
might serue as trials and touch-stones of his truth,
to examine the seuerall miracles, the mysteries and morall
precepts of his law, that both in themselues and in
others they might be for confirmation of the saith; that
the power of God might likewise discouer it selfe, for
the greater the aduersarie and opposition is, the more
noble is the conquest: and therefore God by the weaknes
and foolishnesse of preaching, confounding the
strength and wisedome of this world, did therein manifest
a miracle, to continue for all succeeding ages. Now
this faith, as finding a strong opposition by learning
and humane knowledge, so in the Apostles it could not
be accompanied with ignorance: and therefore as God
gaue thē the gift of tongues, so vndoubtedly the knowledge
of nature (the same God being the God both of
nature and grace); for they could not demonstrate the
one, without some reference and relation to the other;
heere you see the Church planted. Now in the great
world, as men came neerer the first mould, so were they
more perfect, both for strength of bodies, and continuance
of yeeres, that so they might intend a propagation
of their kinde. So was it in the growth of the
Church, the first Fathers which did neerer approch to
the times of the Apostles, had a greater measure of
knowledge by the imposition of their hands, that so
they might bee better inabled and instructed for the
conuersion of nations.The Prophets confirme the doctrine of the Fathers. Thus the Prophets in the old
law▪ speaking of the florishing kingdome of Christ,
seeme to point at the times of the Fathers, and as it
were to seale them before hand, and to proclaime them
to the whole world as Orthodoxall; and therefore as fit

precedents and examples, for all future ages and successions
to follow; so that to detract from the Fathers and
the primitiue age, were to detract from Gods prouidence,
and vnder colour of a naked text (which may
w
                  •
               ll admit diuers expositions), to draw all things to innouation
and vncertaintie.
            In the last place, I will speake of the life, and of the
death, both of our selues and of the Ancients: As man
comes not to that strength and growth, which heretofore
he did;The length of our liues compared with the Ancients. so vndoubtedly hee is sooner ripened, and
comes to that weaknesse, which nature hath appointed
him, thē heretofore he did: and being not of that sound
constitution, as the Ancients were, he hath not that certaintie
in the course of his life, but vpon all occasions,
out of his weaknesse, he is apt and ready to fall. This I
conceiue to bee the reason, why our Gentrie in these
daies should desire to match their children so young,
and that the children themselues should in the spring
or morning of their age, be so fit to ingender: now for
the length of our liues, some haue been much mistaken,
supposing that it might be fitly gathered by the raignes
of Princes in former times, whereas indeede there is
little heede to be taken vnto them; seeing the time of
their gouernment, hath no relation to the yeers of their
age, but to the death of their ancestors, or to the time of
their election; so that if you will suppose, the predecessor
to liue long, the successor may likewise liue long,
yet raigne but a short time. And heretofore Princes
did more aduenture themselues in the danger of their
warres, then now they doe, and therefore more did miscarrie;
but if you please to consider their liues together,
most certaine it is, that before the deluge, men liued
many hundred yeeres, and the birth of their children
carried a iust proportion to their age: since the deluge,
(assuredly) the decay hath proceeded by degrees. Dauid
               
in his time, who liued much about the yeere after the
worlds creation 2890, which was twelue hundred
yeeres after the deluge, or thereabouts, confesseth, that
the age of man was threescore and ten yeeres; for then
it should seeme they came to that age with ful strength:
but in these times, few men (I will not speake of Princes,
such as Dauid was, whose daintie and delicate fare
doth certainly shorten the course of their liues) doe attaine
with much sorrow and griefe to threescore and
tenne yeeres; though I confesse that this alteration, as
all other naturall alterations whatsoeuer, doth not so
easily appeare to the sense, but is more fitly gathered by
the obseruation of reason; for I thinke that seuentie
yeeres then, had the same proportion that fiftie yeeres
haue now at this time.
            From man I will come to the elements, and I will insist
in the neerest elemēts (the generatiue elements), the
water and earth; for this change and alteration appeares
not in man alone, but the very elements themselues
are much decaied in their wonted perfection: fo
                  ••
               our
seas are growne fruitlesse and barraine,The seas doe not affoord the like quantitie of fish, as heretofore they haue done. as it appeares
vpon records in our Hauen townes, that a farre
greater quantitie of fish hath formerly been taken and
brought into this land, then there is in these daies. If
you answer me, yt it proceeds from the loosenes of these
times, as neglecting all fasts, I doe easily confesse our
abuse; yet I think it not sufficient to cause this scarcitie;
for our sailes at this time are more in number then euer
they were, our skill is much better, our wants and necessities
are farre greater, and so our labour and industrie
should bee proportioned accordingly. I rather
thinke it proceeds from the decay of the elements; or
indeed doe esteeme it as a punishment of God vpon vs,
as hee sometimes punished the Egyptians with their
flesh-pots in the death of their fish, Exod. 7. 18. I might

               e likewise iustly complaine of the wrong and iniurie,
which wee daily sustaine from the incroching Hollander,
or low-countriman; who desires to vnite seas, as
he hath already vnited Prouinces, and to make himselfe
the great Lord of the Ocean: for as in ancient times
their golden fleece was made of our English wooll, so
now their great Fleete must incroach vpon our seas (for
kingdomes haue a proprietie, as in their townes and
their soyle, so in their coasts, and their seas, which they
cannot neglect, with their owne profit or safetie). But
I may speake it with greater hearts griefe, I feare lest
their seas and in-undations, doe not only reach to our
Hauen townes, but haue generally ouerwhelmed this
whole Iland: for as my most deare and louing schoole-master,Mr Camden.
Mr. William Camden, now Clarenceux, ye
                famous
&amp; most renowned Antiquarie of our age, hath truly &amp;
wisely obserued in his Chronicle, in the time of our seruice
in their warres (in the Low-countries, our Englishmen,
which of all other Northerne people, were euer
held the most temperate), we haue gottē such an habit
and custome of drunkennesse, that no other nation at
this day seemes to be more tainted with that vice, then
our selues. And thus their vnthankfulnesse, together
with those ill customes, which we haue borrowed from
them, seeme to be the rewards of our seruice.
            From the seas, I will come to the land: The earth is
growne barraine and fruitlesse in her owne kinde; I
speake not onely of that earth, which hath long tasted
the plow-share and harrow,The earth is growne barraine. and must haue a time of
respite and ease, to recouer her owne strength; but, the
whole earth in generall doth not beare the like burthen
and crop, which it did in the daies of our forefathers:
for as it is in a part, so it is in the whole. Suppose,
that any quantitie of ground were yeerely employed
to medow, arable, or pasture, and that the whole crop

of this ground should bee yeerely spent vpon it selfe,
and so should returne againe in compost; certainly this
ground would much decay in goodnesse, for in vaine
shall wee expect the good seasons of the yeere, vnlesse
the earth carrie in it selfe a kinde of fatnesse. Yet I confesse
that some grounds there are, either rich of themselues,
or made rich by water-floods, that they doe not
only preserue themselues, but likewise serue to helpe others;
yet euery husbandman cannot bee so happie to
haue them, and where they are in greatest abundance,
yet they cannot supplie the barrennesse of the neighbour
and bordering grounds: for nature more abounds
in the one, then in the other, so that this must argue a
barrennes in generall,As in the parts so in ye whole. though not in particular. Whereunto
I will adde the weakenesse of the elements, decay
of the heauens, and a generall imperfection in al things
now, in this la
                  •
               t old and cold age of the world; &amp; therfore
those countries, which were first inhabited (suppose
the Easterne countries), are very much impouerished
at this time; the weaknesse of nature discouering
it selfe, not able to supplie those mines and mettals,
which formerly they did; not able to bring foorth or to
ripen those excellent delicious fruits, which heretofore
they had in great plentie.
            To draw neerer home, for this kingdome wherein
we liue; it is not only the complaint of all old men, and
our own experiēce, but likewise many reasons drawne
from husbandrie,A particular instance for this kingdome. not so fit to bee alleaged in this place,
doe vndoubtedly perswade me, that our land is growne
barraine, and yeelds not that profit, which formerly it
did, in the daies of our forefathers: I will make one or
two instances, following the counsell of the wise man,
Eccles. 39. 31. The fruitfulnesse of a land especially appeares
in the hony and wine; the one proceeds from the
dew of the flower▪ the other takes a deeper foundation

in the earth; the one argues the sweetnesse of the grasse
or the pasture, the other the goodnesse and depth of the
mould; the one is the worke onely of nature▪ the other
requires the helpe and furtherance of husbandrie and
art; and in both of them it shall sufficiently appeare,
how this land hath declined. When I consider the
great vse of hony in former times,We haue not the like quantitie of hony now, as heretofore. for their drinkes, for
their foode; and likewise the great quantitie of waxelights,
which were anciently spent in their diuine seruice;
assuredly our countrey at this day cannot affoord
the one halfe of that which formerly it did, it is apparent;
for there was neuer so great scarcitie, and yet it is
not transported, and here at home we haue little vse to
imploy it. Is it because men neglect ye keeping of Bees?
No certainly, the price would allure them, for there is
no such profit, with so little charge; but certainly nature
in generall is weakned, the creatures begin to decay
and God denies his blessing for the increase.
            Secondly, it is very credibly reported, that in this our
Northerne climate we haue had heretofore a vintage in
Wostershire; and it appeares vpon record, that tith hath
bin paid for wine pressed out of grapes, growing in the
little Parke at Winsor,Our grapes come not to that ripenes now, as heretofore. in the time &amp; being then in the
possessiō of King Edw. 1. But at this time, whether thorough
the cold mould of the earth, or thorough the
weaknesse and swift declining of the sun, as being not
able to bring our grapes to ripenesse and perf
                  •
               ction (the
grapes being a very lateward fruit, containing a great
naturall heate, which appeares by the strength of our
wines, and their long continuance, and therfore require
a hot soyle); yet at this time it is thought to be a work
impossible: the like may bee said for Wales, and the
North parts of this kingdome in many places, where
fruits and saffron did anciently growe, (the places still
carrying the names of those fruits), within these late

yeeres, triall being made, and all possible diligence and
good husbandry obserued, yet they faild in their purposes.
            It may be obiected against me, that if nature did thus
decline, yet still the fruits should continue the same,
though not the same in their strength and their power;
for wine here in England, if euer we had, then still wee
should haue, though more imperfect and weake; but
Philosophy is well able to answere this obiection, datur
in rebus maximum &amp; minimum: nature hath appointed
certaine limits and bounds to euery kinde of the creatures,
beyond which, or beneath which, the creature
cannot subsist. Now in the generall declining, far bee it,
that she should appoint new boundes to the vndeterminated
essence of the creatures;An obiection answered in Philosophie. rather she should preserue
them as long as it lies in her power, and being defectiue,
not able to produce them, there should follow
a cessation of their being, and no new qualification of
their nature: and in this declining, some things are
more limited then others, and therfore will admit fewer
degrees in their qualities and will sooner perish; so
that notwithstanding the decay doth equally concerne
all, yet some things may wholy cease, while others shall
still be continued, out of the large extent of their owne
bounds.
            That a generall scarcitie and penury may appeare,
consider the prices of things, how excessiue they are in
these our latter dayes, and how they are raised aboue
measure beyond all expectation: heretofore (I confesse)
they haue had as great famins as we haue,The excessiue prices of things, and the scarcitie of these times. but I suppose
not so vsually; and commonly these famins did not arise
from any vnseasonable weather, or barrennesse of the
earth, but rather from ciuill war
                  •
               es within themselues,
making hauocke and waste of natures blessings, and of
poore mens labours; for if you would suppose (which

God forbid) a Campe subsisting of 20000. men to bee
lodged within the hart of our kingdome, assuredly it
would cause an extraordinary great dearth amongst vs:
but now we seeme to sustaine a continuall famine, notwithstanding
our peaceable times, and our great labours
(necessity so inforcing vs); and therefore we can
blame none but nature, nor can we thinke that she is casually
distempered, for then I would gladly aske, when
at lēgth (in Gods name) wil she returne to her first temper
and constitution? for we see no tokens, signes, or appearance
of any recouery; and therefore we feare, that
she daily more and more decayes in her ould age, and in
vaine may we expect reformation: for whereas some
suppose the causes of this scarcitie, to be either the wonderfull
increase of people, or the great plentie of coyne,
wherewith we abound in respect of our Ancestors; these
reas
                  •
               ns which do so much ouer-sway many, I wil brieflie
examine.
            For the number of men, wee are not able to send
forth such huge armies, as we read of in former times;
we dare not vndertake such taskes,A comparison betweene our times and the former, for the number and multitude of men. and infinit labours
as they did: I confesse indeed, that the Cities and
townes do now swarme with people, and therefore they
make the greater shewe of a number; but the country
(which truly and indeed did afford it) in a scattered and
dispersed Multitude (I thinke) was neuer more naked
and desolat then it is at this day. Such depopulation of
townes, inclosing of villages; a shepheard with his dog
their inhabiting, where formerly many hundred men
were maintained, many good horses kept for defence
of our land, and much prouision for our plentie.
He that shall well consider our lawe-bookes, the exact
measuring of lands in those dayes, the largenes and capacity
of their Churches, the ould foundations, which
now are daily raked vp by the plow; shall (by all probable

coniecture) conceiue, that the world was then as wel
peopled as it is in these times. The Church-bookes indeed
are not extant, which might serue for our euidence;Bangor in Wales neere Wre
                     •
                  am.
yet this I can say for a truth, that in Bangor
(which is a small village in Wales) 800. yeers ago, there
were abiding and daily resident there, two and twenty
hundred Monkes, besides seruants and others which did
attend them: at this day I could see no reliques thereof,
onely some fewe closes did beare the name of porches
and gates; and I thinke at this time, that both our Vniuersities
can hardly equall that number. Since (it should
seeme) that our land did surfeit with people, and therfore
it was to be let bloud, in the wars between the two
houses of Lancaster and Yorke: and he that will conceiue,
how infinitly the people of Israel did multiply in
a short time, liuing vnder the bondage of Aegypt, will
neuer doubt but that this land might haue bin sufficiently
stockt and stored with people, long since the first
plantation.
            Now for the plenty of our coyne, because we haue it
not from our selues, I will therefore first speake of the
fountaines before I come to the streames, that so according
to the ouerflowing of the one, you may iudge of
the other. If the West Indies haue now at length bin
discouered, the Easterne haue failed; otherwise our Marchants
should neuer be so much inforced,Gods prouidence in

their coyne: and heerein I do acknowledge a speciall
prouidence of God, who foreseeing in his wisdom, that
the carnall Mahumetans (his owne professed enemies)
should possesse the land of Promise: and as their forefathers
the Iewes and the Heathen, were guilty of the
bloud of Christ; so they should seaze vpon the holy sepulchre,
in token of the bloudy persecution of his
Church (all which God did permit in his iustice for our
sinnes), yet hee in his wisedome, first suffered it to bee

worne out with vse, or to decay of it selfe, before the
cursed Ottomans should conquer it: for notwithstanding
the large circuite of his territories and prouinces,
yet in wealth and treasure, yea in the power of his countrey,
and most especially in the strength of his Nauie,
the Turke is inferiour to some Christian Princes. But
let vs consider the plentie of coyne, as Scripture reports
it; Abraham gaue vnto Ephron (as it may appeare, Gen.
23. vers. 16.)The great plenty of coine and of siluer and gold▪ among the Iewes. foure hundred siluer shekels for a field to
burie his dead: Now the common shekell is accounted
twentie pence, which if it shall please you to multiplie,
foure hundred shekels will amount to three and thritie
pound sixe shillings, eight pence; supposing fiue shillings
sterling the ounce (a very large price to purchace
a buriall). The plentie of their siluer and gold did likewise
appeare in those times, by their wearing of rings,
bracelets, abilimentss, &amp;c. of the magnificence of Salomons
Court, of the wealth and treasure of the Temple,
where all the vessels were of a wonderfull price; and
of the custome in those times, to send out shipping, and
to returne home loaded with oare, Scripture makes
mention. Whereunto prophane and heathen writers,
doe likewise beare witnesse, for Eupolenus, Polyhistor,
and Hecateus Abderita, that liued and serued in warre
with King Alexander the Great, make mention (amongst
other things) of the inestimable riches of Salomon,
and of the treasures which he did hide and bury
(according to the fashion of that time) in the Sepulchre
of his father Dauid: which to be no fable, (though not
mentioned by the Scripture) Iosephus well proueth, for
that Hircanus the high Priest, and King of Iurie, being
besieged in Ierusalem by Antiochus, surnamed Pius,
not many yeeres before Christs natiuitie, to redeeme
himselfe and the Citie, and to pay for his peace, opened
the said Sepulchre of Dauid, and fetcht out of one part

thereof, three thousand talents in ready money, which
amount to 600000. pounds English, if we account the
talents but at the least size of talentum Haebraicum.
            
            But let vs draw to our selues, and come to this climate
wherin we liue, and compare our wealth in coyne
with our ancestors: first therefore I must acquaint you,
that our coyne is much fallen,How the coine here amongst vs, hath daily decayed in weight. &amp; beares not that weight
which formerly it did; for it appeares among the statutes
of Edward the 2, that twentie pence sterling, then
waied an ounce: in the ninth yeere of Edward the 3,
26. pence waied an ounce: in the second of Hen. the 6.
32. pence waied an ounce: in the 5. of Edward the 4.
40. pence waied an ounce: in the 31. of Henry the 8.
45. pence waied the ounce: in the second of Elizabeth
60. pence waied the ounce: and so it continueth vnto
this day; so that an hundred pounds heretofore, was as
much as three hundred pounds now, besides the finesse
of their coyne: wherein, as I take it, they did farre exceede
vs. I will not dispute, how it may stand with the
wisedome and policie of States, to raise or inhaunce
coynes: but certaine it is, that the prices of all things
will immediatly follow the coynes, according to the
weight, finenesse and goodnesse of the mettall; though
things may be done to serue the present turne, yet they
shall finde a great abatement in their ancient rents:The great wealth of the Ancients.
where a little innouation is once begun, it is wonderfull
to see the abuses which doe vsually accompanie it,
&amp;c. Now if wee shall obserue the shrines and guilding
of Temples in former times; if wee consider the rich
Copes, the ornaments, vestiments, and vessels of the
Church; or the robes and hangings of Princes, which
are yet extant; or the moneys and coyne which at this

Romanes haue formerly encamped; if we consider their

cunning, in cutting, caruing, and curious workmanship
of stones, and mettals, farre surpassing vs; their
borders, wiers, and other ornaments made of beaten
gold or siluer, more then in vse, then they are in these
daies: and that our ancestors haue found out mines at
their owne homes, that vndoubtedly for all other mettals,
as Lead, Iron, Tinne, Copper, Brasse, and the like, it
appeares by their buildings, and their other imployments,
that they had them in a farre greater plentie,
then we haue in these daies: and mettals are so interchangeably
mixed together (which is the ground of all
Chimistrie), that the plentie of the one, cannot possibly
subsist with any great scarcity of the other.
            Now at this time I feare there is more siluer and
gold wastfully spent and transported, then is yeerely
brought into this land, notwithstanding the prices of
things doe daily arise, though not in such an excessiue
manner, as formerly they haue done.
            As for some base coynes which they had in ancient
times, I may well doubt, whether it stood not with the
wisedome and policie of the State to admit them, seeing
the richest nations doe the like at this day.
            To speake with more certaintie of things, which appeare
vpon record; he that shall peruse our Law-books,
shall finde, that three hundred yeeres agoe and aboue,
before the warres began betweene the two Houses,The 
                     •
                  osts, charges and fines were very large heretofore. the
costs and charges at law, were very great and large, almost
as much as at this day: speaking now out of the
course of mine owne studies, I may seeme to be a stranger,
wholly ignorant therein; yet giue me leaue (with
your good patience) to make one or two instances to
this purpose. William Wickam recouered of his predecessor
Bishop Edendon of Winchester, in the yere 1366,
for dilapidations of his house, 1662. pounds, tenne shillings:
and lest you might conceiue that such a large

summe of money might bee allowed for some other
losse and detriment sustained, hee recouered likewise
1556. head of Neate, 3876. Weathers, 4717. Ewes,
3521. Lambes, and 127. Swine; all which stocke belonged
to the Bishopricke. Because wee cannot take a
perfect suruey of the buildings, how they were left; and
generally because all trespasses are very vncertaine,
whereof wee cannot take due notice; let vs therefore
come to the fines, which certainly were very large in
those daies: In the time of Henry the 6, the Duke of
Holland (being then high Admirall) was fined at tenne
thousand poūds, for holding plea in a cause determinable
at the Common law; it was very much for such an
offence, if you please to haue relation to the rates of
coyne, which before I haue prefixed.
            Not to speake of the ransomes of Princes, which
were very great in former times; not to speake of any
particular mans wealth, though I could name many; for
Thomas Ruthall, whose meanes of getting were not ouer
great, neither could he iustly be taxed with greedinesse
or sparing,The great house-keeping of the Ancients. liuing in the time of Henry the 7, his
wealth in present coyne did amount to aboue one hundred
thousand pounds, which was discouered by Cardinall
Wolsey. I pray' consider their house-keeping, such
huge gates, and open doores, spatious halles, long tables,
great kitchins, large chimneys; their sellars, ouens,
vessels, pots, and powdring tubs, deepe, profound, and
bottomlesse: all their other prouision made in a bountifull
manner, as may appeare by the rents of their tenants,
their barnes, granaries, granges, slaughter-houses;
the multitudes of mouthes in their numberlesse feruants;
the ringing of bels to call all to their feasts; their
infinite holy daies, which were the times for their meeting.
These things duly considered, you shall find their
expense was very excessiue. Now take these with their

prices, and first for those things which were brought ouer
into this kingdome; Henry Bowet, Archbishop of
Yorke in the time of Henry the 5, spent in his house
yeerely of Claret wine onely, foure score tunnes: this
might seeme incredible, were it not that it appeares by
such euidence, as cannot bee denied. Now let vs examine
the price of this wine: I finde among the slatutes
of Edw. the 2. (which was long before that time), that
Vintners were appointed to sell their wine at twelue
pence the gallon, and not aboue; we cannot reade, nor
cannot conceiue that since that time wine should fall
in the price,Wine was dearer in ancient times, then it is. being none of our owne commodities; so
then supposing wine at twelue pence the gallon, and
considering that 26 pence then waied an ounce, whereas
now 60 pence goe to the ounce; he then spent only
in Claret wine (if I doe not mistake in my reckonings)
9304. ounces 8/13, which did thē amount to 1008 poūds:
which foresaid number of ounces, would now amount
to 2326 pounds, three shillings, one penny: at this time
supposing wine to be at two shillings ye gallon, as now
it is sold▪ you may buy as much for 8064 ounces, which
would be worth 2016 pounds of our currant money; so
that you shall saue 1240. ounces 8/13, which heretofore
the same wine would haue cost; which number of ounces,
being reduced into pounds, it will amount to 310
pounds, three shillings, one penny: so that it appeares,
that wine is now sold cheaper, by a seuenth part, then
heretofore it hath been, which makes much to shew the
plentie of their coyne.
            To speake of our owne countrie prouision, assuredly
the prices of things doe not hold proportion, and correspondencie
to the weight and valuation of coynes;
as may appeare by that most excellent statute of rentcorne,
made in the behalfe of our Vniuersities, which
hath proued so beneficiall to Colledges. And if you

please to consider the almes-deedes,The plentie of their coyne appeared in their almes. and charitable beneuolence
of former times, as well in their money, as in
their victuals, you may truly affirme, that as they farre
exceeded vs in the one, so they came not much short in
the other. It shall appeare by this one instance: Richard
de Burie, sometimes Bishop of Durrham in the yeere
1333, bestowed weekly, for the reliefe of the poore,
eight quarters of wheate, made into bread, besides the
fragmēts of his house, the offals of his slaughter-house,
and yeerely much clothing: In his iourney betweene
New Castle and Durrham, he gaue alwaies by his own
appointed order, eight pounds in almes; from Durrham
to Stocton, fiue pounds; from Durrham to Aukland,
fiue marks; from Durrham to Middleham, fiue pounds.
They that succeeded these old Bishops in their wealth
and abundance, I hope will excuse our new and now
Bishops, if they be not so plentifull in their almes, when
as indeed they seeme to succede them only in the Cure,
the Pastorall charge, and imposition of hands.
            To conclude, these excessiue prices of things do well
argue a great scarcitie,The corrupt dealings of this age, in respect of former times. that the whole world is turned
bankrupt, though we to saue our owne credit, can make
the best shew for our honor &amp; reputations sake; we can
name huge summes of money, but wee borrow vpon
such base tearmes, wee set our lands vpon such a racktrent,
that if the tenant payes one yeere, he runnes away
the next: and therefore I am perswaded, that men in letting
out their lands in such manner, doe not so much
regard the present rent, as a future intended sale of
those lands, after twentie, or two and twentie yeeres
purchase; for otherwise they would neuer bee fed with
words in effect, and neglect their present securitie. An
other cause of our scarcitie may be (besides the heauie
iudgements of God, whereof I wil not dispute) our immoderate
vse of the creatures; men were neuer so delicate

and curious in their diet or food, as they are at this
day, neuer so wastfull in their expence, the world did
neuer so much abound with surfeits and drunkennesse:
heretofore they had their fastings as well as their feastings,
but this is superstitious (forsooth). Thus while
some proue infinitly lauish, dissolute, and riotous, the
poore people of our land neuer sustained the like scarcitie
and wants. I might likewise accuse the euill disposition
of men, for in ancient times, they knew not the
art of monopolizing, their meaning was honest and
plaine; but we are our crafts-masters, the Landlord neuer
ceasing from racking his poore tenants, and the tenants
must set an answerable price on their wares: heretofore
it was thought a poynt of conscience, that euerie
man should sell his commodities according to such reasonable
rate,
               We dissent from the Ancients in a case of conscience. 
               as he himselfe could affoord them; but now
our conscience is inlarged, and therefore wee must inlarge
our price, supposing that it is lawfull for euery man
to make the most of his owne, and to sell his owne wares to
the greatest aduantage. Thus euery man

               riues to raise.
the market; and thus things are inhaunced to the great
preiudice of many Lords, who cannot alter their quitrents;
and to the vtter vndoing of the poore Commonaltie,
when the labours of men, and the drudgerie of
poore people is not, nor cannot bee inhaunced accordingly.
            Now since the fruitfulnesse, or barrennesse of the
earth, proceedes from the influence and disposition of
the heauens; in the last place I dare accuse the materiall
heauens, as being guiltie, conspiring, and together
ioyntly tending to corruption; Scripture shall warrant
me,The materiall heauen; tend to corruption. 
               the heauens shall waxe old as doth a garment, Psalme
102. vers. 26. Reason and all humane learning shall
backe me, for certaine it is, that the Sunne hath descended
much lower by many degrees, then he was in the

time of King Ptolemie; the same Mathematicall instruments,
which agree together in all other dimensions,
doe vndoubtedly proue the diuersitie; by vertue of perspectiue
glasses, we haue lately discerned spots and shadowes
in the Moone; and within our memorie, in the
yeere 1572. a true Comet did appeare in the eighth
Heauen, which as it had a time of beginning, so had it
a period, and time of dissoluing. And thus being mortall
of our selues, wee dwell in houses of clay, the roofe
of this world, as well as the foundations shall together
be mooued; for wherefore serues the diuersitie of seasons,
the day and the night succeeding each other, Summer
and Winter, the rising and setting of Starres, the
different and contrarie motions, the various aspects
and oppositions? but that in some sort they partake of
our nature, and shall haue their part and portion with
ours.
            For proofe of this truth, let vs compare times with
times, and so it shall better appeare; the hot Zones
heretofore adiudged by all the Ancients to be vnhabitable,The hot Zones made habitable.
we know that now they are habitable, and furnisht
with people; let vs thinke reuerently of the Ancients,
they were very wise, and as I suppose far exceeding
vs. Can we conceiue them to be such simple men,
so fondly mistaken at their owne homes, being neighbours,
and bordering vpon these hot climates, where a
few daies sayling, would discouer the truth? a truth so
manifest and palpable, as that they could not pretend
any grosse ignorance; let vs doe them no wrong, but so
esteeme of them, as we desire our po
                  •••
               ritie may regarde
vs. What a shame and dishonour were it to vs, if future
ages shall condemne vs for fooles and lyars; and that
our testimonie should be reiected in such things as concerne
our times, whereof triall and experience might
informe vs, without further reason or discourse? Rather

let vs wonder at the prouidence of God, when the
world was yet in her infancie and youth, no maruell if
heate did abound, the earth as yet was vnpeopled, and
therefore men in those dayes had roome enough, to
make choice of their habitation and dwelling; but now
the world grones vnder the multitude and number of
people, the heauens doe likewise decay in their wonted
strength. And therefore now at length, new Ilands appeare
in the Ocean,The wonderfull worke of Gods prouidence. which before neuer were extant;
other Ilands and Continents are daylie discouered,
which were concealed from antiquitie; places formerlie
knowne to be excessiue in heate, are made habitable
by the weakenesse and olde age of the heauens; the
colde Zones are tempered either thorough thicke misty
ayre, or the stipation of coldnesse, God preparing their
bodies, and giuing them food and clothing accordinglie.
Thus God in the beginning of the world, out of his
owne foresight and goodnesse, did fit and temper himselfe
according to the times and occasions (giue mee
leaue to speake after the manner of men, though otherwise
I know the immutabilitie of Gods nature), as long
as there was vse of Paradise, so long it continued in
state and perfection, being once forsaken and destitute,
then followed the dissolution.
            If the Ancients were strangers abroade, and might
easilie mistake, yet in their owne dwellings and habitations,
their sense for want of reason would serue to informe
them;The burning of Phaeton. certaine it is, that there was a great burning
in Phaetons time, though grounded I confesse
vpon a fabulous historie; yet for the truth of it, signes
and tokens thereof did appeare for many subsequent
ages: and strange it is among the heathen, what preuention
of fire did hereby insue; inuenting a kinde of
slate which might resist the violence of fire, and therein
reseruing and laying vp the hidden treasure of their

writings and records, against such a generall combustion;
whereas in these daies we neuer found the heate of
the sunne to be such, we neuer sustained any such dammage,
but that the coldnesse and moysture of the winter
could easilie recompence our losse; nay rather we haue
iust cause to complaine of the sunnes weakenesse, and
that he is defectiue in heate: notwithstanding that in
this time of his olde age, God hath appoynted that the
sunne should enter into the hot signes, yet both sunne
and signes are defectiue in their power, and cannot
ripen our fruites in that manner, which formerly the
sunne alone did in the waterie constellations. What a
strange difference appeares in our seasons, more then in
ancient times; we can not promise vnto our selues the
like certaintie, neither in our seede time, nor in our haruest,
nor in the whole course of the yeere, which they
did: for a wonder it is, to heare the relation of old men
in this kinde, how they all seeme to agree in one complainte,
which certainely betokens a truth. If you tell
me of our corrupt computation of the yeere, my answere
is, that the change is so insensible (not a day in an
age) as that it makes no sensible difference; yet herein
I cannot excuse our selues, for if the world should continue
many ages, our Christmas would fall out in haruest:
whereas certaine it is, that the day was first appoynted
according to Christs birth, and Christ was
borne neere solstitium brumale, when the dayes were
the shortest, and then began to increase; as Iohn Baptist
was borne at Midsommer, when the dayes were at the
longest, and then began to shorten; to be a figure (as
Saint Ambrose obserueth) that Christ should increase,
as Iohn Baptist decreased; but now in these times, our
dayes are increased a full houre in length, before the
Natiuitie.
            If still thou proouest wilfull, and wilt not beleeue the

Ancients, but talkest onely of thine owne experience
and particular knowledge; it were to bee wished, that
thou shouldest trie all conclusions in Physicke vpon
thine owne bodie, that so thou mightest see onely with
thine owne eyes, and take nothing by relation from others:
if thou iudgest of times past by thine owne little
experience, thou canst not truely iudge of the workes
of nature,Naturall alterations are insensible. which haue in themselues insensible changes
and alterations; thou canst not see thy selfe growing,
yet at length thou perceiuest thine owne growth. Suppose
there were little alteration in this world, it would
then argue the newnesse of this world, that it was created
but this morning, for as yet the Heauens haue not
once seene their owne reuolutions: it would likewise
argue the excellencie of the workeman, as in the framing,
so in the continuance of his worke; for if the heauens
should alwaies want some repayring and mending,
we might well thinke, that the state of the Church
triumphant, were not vnlike the state of the Church
militant, alwaies requiring, and calling for dilapidations;
yet in reason, you shall easilie discerne the vndoubted
tokens of the worlds ruine.
            Now that I am falne to the generall dissolution of
this world, which shall bee performed by the rage and
violence of fire, according to the receiued tradition of
the Ancients; whereunto Scripture agrees, and according
to the opinion of the best learned Philosophers,
who ascribe the greatest actiuitie to fire: and were it
not for the situation, as being aboue the rest of the elements,
and for that naturall inclination which it hath in
it selfe (arising out of an inbred pride, as knowing his
excellencie aboue the rest), that being once out of his
owne proper place, it will not thus be supprest, but will
ascend with the greatest swiftnesse, and expedition, carrying
the forme of a pyramise, for the more easie penetration;

assuredly all the rest of the elements together
conspiring,Fire doth resemble the last iudgement. could not incounter the fire. Now fire hath
this propertie, congregare homegenea &amp; segregare heterogenea,
and therein doth figure out the last and finall
iudgement, wherein a separation shall be made of the
Goates from the Lambes, of the corne from the chaffe,
of the iust from the reprobate: I cannot nor dare not
prescribe the day and houre of that iudgement, rather
with patience I will waite on Gods leisure, &amp; with my
assured hope, will expect to see my Redeemer in his
flesh, and in my flesh, so descending as he ascended; for
herein we haue the testimonie of Angels, This Iesus
which is taken vp from you into Heauen, shall so come, as
you haue seene him goe into Heauen,
               The last iudgement approacheth. Acts 1. 11; the same
in nature, the same in power, the same in mercy, the
same in true loue and affection: Iesus the sonne of Dauid,
Iesus the sonne of Marie, who was the propitiation
for our sinnes, and shall come againe in glorie to iudge
both the quicke and the dead. Yet sure I am, that the
time cannot bee long absent, for all the signes of his
comming doe already appeare: when the hangings and
furniture are taken downe, it is a token that the King
and the Court are remoouing;The generall decay of nature hastens the iudgeme
                     •
                  t. nature now beginning
to dacay, seemes to hasten Christs comming: to let passe
many strong presumptions of our Diuines, concerning
the approach of that day; these three proofes, drawne
from naturall reason, doe easilie induce mee to beleeue
it.
            First, looking to the generall decay of this world,
which argues the approach of this iudgement: secondly,
to the great preparation for f
                  ••
               e, which must then
serue for the execution of Gods wrath: thirdly, the fit
occasions seeming to hasten this iudgement, &amp;c. Most
certaine it is, that if the world should continue many
thousand yeeres, and that wee should suppose that nature

would decay in such sort, as we are able to proue
by demonstratiue euidence, already she hath done; assuredly
nature of her selfe, thorough her owne weakenesse
would come to nothing; and the world should
not bee able to supplie mens necessities. Suppose this
one kingdome, besides the generall barrennesse which
hath befalne vs, whereof wee may iustly complaine; if
we should commit the like waste in our woods, as formerly
wee haue done, in this last forepassed age; assuredly
we should bee left so destitute of fuell, of houses,
of shipping, that within a short time, our land would
proue almost inhabitable, for such things as require a
great growth, wherein man cannot see the present
fruites of his prouidence; husbandrie and labour, for
the most part, they are alwaies neglected, and it lies not
in the power of one age to recouer her selfe: thus out
of the decay of nature we may almost expect a dissolution,
as by the signes and symptomes we iudge of a dangerous
and desperate disease. Thus you may obserue almost
a like distance, from the creation to the deluge,
from the deluge to Christ,An equall distance of time in Gods iudgements. from Christ vnto vs; as God
ordaines euery thing according to rule, order and measure:
after fifteene generations 
                  •
               xpired, you shall alwaies
note in Scripture, some great alteration and
change. Saint Matthew was therefore called from the
receite of custome, to cast vp this account in the genealogie
of Christ, as it appeares in his first chapter: now at
length in Gods name what may wee expect should befall
vs? Whatsoeuer concernes the kingdome of Shilo,
consummatum est, it is already perfited, wee must not
looke for any further addition; that which remaines, it
is the sound of the trumpet, vt consummetur seculum,
that the world may be destroyed by fire.
            Secondly, fire shall bee the second ouerthrowe, this
Scripture and reason confirmes; now certaine it is, that

God who hath first instituted nature, hath so ordained
her,The last iudgement shall be, while the fierie constellations doe rule. as she may best serue to be an instrument to worke
his owne ends and purposes; to shew a conformitie of
the effects with the cause, thereby to manifest his owne
empire and rule which still he retaines in the creatures:
as likewise the obedientiall power, whereunto the creatures
are subiect; that so may appeare how absolute and
powerfull he is, first to appoint the creatures, then how
gracious and mercifull he is, to impart himselfe, and to
ioyne with the creatures in the same action. Thus the
waterie constellations did then gouerne and rule, when
the world was ouerwhelmed with waters, now at this
time, and for a few hundred yeeres yet to continue, the
fierie constellations shall haue the predominancie; and
therefore credible it is, that within the compasse of
this time, there shall happen the generall combustion.
            Thirdly, the dissolution of this world betokens a generall
punishment, the iudgement accompaning hath
reference to our transgressions:The necessitie of iustice, in regarde of our sinnes, seemes to hasten th
                     •
                  s iudgement. as in the first permission
of sinne appeares the goodnesse of God, who can turne
our sinnes to his glorie, either for the manifestation of
his mercy or iustice; so in this great tolerating of sinne
appeares Gods patience and long suffering. But now
our sinnes are come to a full ripenesse, now is the haruest,
and the weedes choake vp the wheate; and therefore
necessitie seemes to inforce, and to hasten the approach
of this iudgement, that at length there might
bee a separation of both, though hetherto they haue
growne vp together. Thus Christs first comming in the
flesh was to restore the decaied state of the Iewes, for
then hee was borne into this world, when charitie was
growne colde, the Priesthood bought and sould for a
price, the Kings office extinguished, the tribe of Iuda
neglected, the synagogue diuided into sects and

schis
                  •
               es; and this is in some sort resembled by the bar
               
                  •••
               
of the earth, for hee came in the winter season,
and hee was borne at midnight, to argue the worlds
vniuersall darknesse and ignorance. So must it bee for
his second comming, he hath giuen vs a watch-word,
that the sonne of man will come at an houre, when hee is
not expected, Luk. 12. vers. 40. Now is that time when
we doe not expect him, we neuer thinke of iudgement,
of hell, of fire, of damnation; Religion hath taken vp
wings, and is returned to heauen, from whence she descended:
Men are now growne carelesse in their profession,
and liue after a sensuall manner like beasts; we
are now growne to the height and top of all sinne; our
sinnes, our crying sinnes now crie for vengeance; and
therefore the time of his comming cannot be farre absent,
hee will take the best opportunitie, like a theefe in
the night; we may then expect him, when wee doe least
expect him. But I will leaue this, as being not so pertinent
to my purpose, and grounded onely vpon coniectures,
&amp;c.
            Now I haue brought man to his graue, and together
with man the whole fabricke of nature, you would
thinke, that at length I should discharge him: I haue
buried him deep enough (I confesse),Our fall is examined by Philosoph
                     •
                  e. for I haue cast the
heauens and the earth vpon him, and together with
man intombed the whole world. Yet giue me leaue in
the last place, to preuent one obiection; for some will
say, that if the fall of man should appeare by the light
of nature, how should those great Sages and Secretaries
of nature (the ancient Philosophers) be so much mistaken?
for the Schooles, and all our Diuines hold, that
they were deceiued in the state of man, supposing man
to be in puris naturalibus, without any thought of his
fall, without any hope of his recouerie.
            I confesse indeede, that the ancient Philosophers

haue not mentioned the fall of man, for they did onely
looke to the present course and order of nature; as, liuing
in the middest of Egypt, they considered Nilus,
the depth of the waters, the violence of the streame, the
ebbings and flowings, but they regarded not the passage
into the sea, nor yet could trace the head of the
fountaine: they might consider man, though not in the
wombe,A Science may presuppose her owne subiect. nor yet in the graue, for euery knowledge may
presuppose her owne subiect, and euery Science hath
her proper bounds and limitations; the knowledge of
nature might presuppose the existencie of nature, and
not intermeddle or be ouer curious to prie into the first
composition, or dissolution of nature; their silence or
neglect herein, can bee no error, though an imperfection.
            Suppose man to bee borne in a prison, where hee
should neuer receiue the sweete light of the Sunne, or
the free libertie of himselfe, but liued in continuall
darknesse and slauerie; could this man possibly conceiue
the happie state and condition of those, who liue
at their freedome? No certainly, for priuations are only
knowne in relation to their habits. The Philosophers
were not vnlike the dwellers of Sodome, whose darknesse
was such, that being abroad in the streetes, they
could not finde their owne houses:The fall of mā is intimated in Philosophie. and yet I will doe
them no wrong, for howsoeuer they could not expresly
and punctually speake of mans fall, yet many opinions
in Philosophie seeme to intimate as much in effect.
            The Platonikes, who were the more ancient Philosophers,
and borrowed certaine mysteries from the Hebrewes,
which they kept sacred and secret to themselues;
though otherwise they knew neither sense nor
meaning of those mysteries, held these three positions
inuiolably, all which doe necessarily inforce the fall of
man. First, that there were, Id
                     ••
                  ae, abstracted and separated

formes,The 
                     ••
                  parated Idea of the Platonikes. according to whose image and likenesse,
things were ordained here vpō earth: the ground of this
opinion, is takē out of Gen. 1. where God in ye framing
of man, speakes these words; Let vs make man according
to our owne image. Now supposing man to bee
made according to Gods image, according to such a
separated Idea, hee should be wholly spirituall, incorruptible,
conformable to God. But considering man to
be carnall, sensuall, an enemie and stranger to God, following
the inclination of his flesh, and wholly tending
to corruption; assuredly he is fallen, and much degenerated
from that high state and dignitie, wherein hee
was first created from the beginning.
            After the framing and constitution of man, the Platonikes
did consider in the next place, the transmigration
of soules from bodies to bodies,The transmigration of soules. not from man vnto
beast; for here the different kinds doe betoken different
soules, which require different organes and instruments,
that so they might bee fitted and proportioned
for the right vse and exercise of their faculties. This
transmigration hath vndoubtedly some reference to
the first infusion of mans soule, &amp; inspirauit deus spiraculum
vitae: and this opinion doth necessarily presuppose,
&amp; is grounded vpon mans fall; yt seeing there is no
proportiō, or agreement between the flesh &amp; the spirit,
(as the case now stands), therfore there was a bodie in
the state of innocencie, more capable of this reasonable
soule; the body changing, the soule did likewise change
her habitation and dwelling; one and the same body
being altered, one and the same soule did find her place
of abode to be altered, here was a transmigration; and
at the last day, when this body sowen in corruption,
shall rise againe in incorruption, &amp; be made a spirituall
body, better befitting the dignitie &amp; state of the soule,
here shall be a new transmigration, still of one and the

selfe same soule; and therefore acknowledge the present
condition of man to bee the fall of man, some punishmēt
or imprisonment of man, that the soule should
be inforced to take her flight, to vse a transmigration,
and to change the place of her dwelling.
            Now for the principall action of the soule, it is our
knowledge or vnderstanding: The Platonikes held,
that cognitio nostra est reminiscentia,
               Our learning is a kinde of remembrance. our learning or
knowledge is only a kind of remembrance; supposing
that man had formerly some naturall knowledge, as all
other creatures haue, thought it was lost by some ill accident,
and therfore must be renewed againe, as it were
called to minde, or better remembred by learning; yet
certainly we had it, for otherwise we should finde farre
greater difficultie in regaining and retaining such an
inestimable iewell: and though this may seeme very
displeasing to Aristotle, who desired to build vp his
fame, in the ruines of Plato (the scholler treads on his
schoole-master); yet doe not his followers say as much
in effect, anima est rasa tabula? rasa est, ergo insculpta
fuit: Who shaued it? who scrapte it? what image is
lost? See heere the prouidence of God, lest wee should
denie, or forget our owne fall and corruption: therefore
the fall and corruption of man, appeares in the forgetfulnes
of man.
            From the Platonikes, I will come to the Schooles of
the famous and thrice renowned Aristotle, and heere I
doe ingeniously, and truly confesse,Proofes out of Aristotles Philosophie. that whatsoeuer I
haue spoken, for the proofe of mans fall, and of natures
corruption, I haue only borrowed it from the grounds
and foundations of his learning; so that this whole
treatise, may not improperly bee ascribed to him, onely
the errors excepted, which I claime as being due vnto
my selfe. To proue mans fall out of his grounds, were to
repeate all; I will therefore heere insist in those things,

which seeme to be most generall, and therein Aristotle
shall speake for himselfe. First for the Metaphysicks,
speaking of things most generall, which the Philosophers
call transcendentia; bonum,
               Bonum est transcendens. the goodnesse of a
creature is numbred and accounted with the rest: and
looking to the first institution of nature, nothing is so
common and triuiall in Philosophie, as is this axiome,
ens &amp; bonum conuertuntur; whatsoeuer is, is good, according
to the approbation of God, in the first of Gen.
&amp; vidit deus, &amp; erant omnia valdè bona: and yet notwithstanding,
the Philosophers did acknowledge, that
there was malum, malitia, defectus, deformitas, monstrū,
and the like, and these to be incident to nature her self;
and these to be knowne onely in relation to the goodnesse,
according to the distance or accesse, hauing no
entitie in themselues, and therefore not able to bee the
grounds of our knowledge, which presupposeth a naturall
being: Rom. 7. 7. I had not knowne sinne, but by
the law. These euils (I say) being no transcendentia, they
could not be so generall, or equal in time to nature, and
therefore they are the punishments of nature, and haue
crept into nature, since the first institution thereof.
            From the Metaphysicks I will come to naturall Philosophie,
where I will onely in a word touch the first
principles. I would gladly demand, why priuatio should
be numbred as one of the three first principles of nature?
for priuation hath reference to the act, and first
presupposeth the act;Why priuation should be one of the first pr
                     •
                  nciples. how then can it be one of the first
principles? there should haue been (I confesse) an absolute
negation, according to the condition of a creature,
as being made of nothing, &amp; nothing includes a negation;
but a priuation is, when a thing is capable to be, and
ought to be, but is not. Therefore priuation being numbred
among the principles, supposeth that all things
should haue been, and should haue much sooner attained

the height of their perfection, and not so leisurely
haue proceeded by degrees, as now they do; were it not
that some curse had altered the course of nature, whereby
that, which formerly was onely a bare negation,
should now be conceiued to be a naturall priuation.
            From the huge Continent of nature, let vs draw neerer
home, and discouer the vnknowne region of the
reasonable soule: alas how few sparkes of reason doe
appeare in this reasonable soule? The Philosophers
thinke it to be a table-booke, wherein nothing is written;
and looking more narrowly, they finde indeede
some blinde characters, certaine obscure, darke, hidden,
secret notions, which are the principles of al our knowledge:
As for example, Contradictoria non possunt esse simul
vera: Omne totum est mains sua parte, and such like
palpable verities, which in my iudgement seeme rather
to belong to the cognizance of common sense, then of
the reasonable soule. And hence it is, that there is much
more difficultie in adorning the inward minde, and couering
the nakednesse of the soule, then in the outward
members, and shame of the body. Thus at length all
Arts and Sciences in generall,All Arts and Sciences take their beginnings by occasion of mans fall. seeme to suppose this for
their ground-worke and foundation; that in regard of
mans fall, and his ignorance, contracted by his fall,
therefore necessitie inforced the occasion of their
births and beginnings. And hence it is, that those long
courses of studie, those night-watchings and great labours
in the Vniuersities, are only vndertaken to supply
natures defects.
            We haue no naturall voyce, no naturall tongue, wee
cannot speake to the vnderstanding of each other, but
Grammar must direct vs and teach vs construction;Grammar. our
soule, though reasonable and discoursiue, yet wants she
the helpe of Logicke,Logicke. to ranke things in their seuerall
order, to knit them together in a proposition, &amp; thence

to draw the inference or conclusion. Man, as if he were
a sauage and wilde creature, cannot speake pleasingly
with a smooth phrase, and gracious deliuerie, as is befitting
the sociable nature of man, without the helpe
and vse of Rhetoricke.Rhetoricke. Mathematickes must teach him,Mathematikes.
how God hath framed his works in number, in weight,
and in measure; the consideration whereof, seemes to
haue been the principall intent and scope of our creation.
The Metaphysicks will attempt to discourse of first
mouers,Metaphysicks. intelligences, and separated soules; yet in truth
and veritie, they doe but onely point at them, and so
leaue them with a Supersedeas, acknowledging natures
infirmitie, and that the due cognizance of them, doth
not properly belong to that Court,
            And whereas God hath giuen all things, for our vse
and seruice, certainly it stood with the same wisedome
and goodnesse of God, to discouer and lay open the
vse:The studie of naturall Philosophie supposeth our naturall ignorance. let vs not conceiue God like an vnwise and negligent
father, who left indeed behinde him great quantitie
of treasure, but so buried and concealed, that it neuer
turned to the profit of his heire; to giue an vnknowne
iewell, though it be a sufficient argument of
bountie, yet it seemes to detract from the wisedome of
the giuer. Suppose an Apothecaries shop were furnisht
with exquisite drugges, yet if the boxes want names
for direction, or there want a Physitian to prescribe the
medicine; it is to be feared, that in such a confusion, poison
should be taken for cordials. The principall proprietie
and substance of euery thing consists in the vse,
without due knowledge of the thing, there can bee no
vse: and therefore it stood with the same diuine wisedome,
as to giue the creatures outwardly to supply our
necessitie and delight; so inwardly in the minde, to imprint
a due knowledge, how man should vse and dispose
them. Euery other facultie hath this knowledge

and instinct toward his obiect; the eye easily conceiueth
all colours, and in a moment, without further aduice,
iudgeth of them by their outward appearance: all
other creatures know what is profitable to themselues,
only the reasonable man is the foole, he is defectiue,
and therefore must intend a long course of Philosophy,
to supplie his owne wants. Howsoeuer, I doe commend
naturall Philosophie,The imperfection of Philosophie. aboue all other humane Arts and
Sciences; yet I haue often wondred, that after so long a
time of studie, (sixe thousand yeeres experience, for so
long the world hath continued), that there should bee
such imperfection, such want of knowledge, such contrarietie
of opinions, in such a noble and most excellent
Science.
            But if wee shut our eyes, not looking to other creatures,
but returning to our selues, wee shall finde farre
greater cause to complaine &amp; lament; the soule, though
otherwise an vnderstanding nature, yet she knowes
not her selfe, but by reflection; she knowes not her
owne beginning, nor her faculties and actions, nor the
extent and bounds of her essence. Blessed God, were it
not sufficient, that all other creatures should bee vnknowne,
but that the soule must bee couered, and concealed
from her selfe? Herein appeares an admirable
guile and subtiltie, which well argues the high wisedome
and iustice of God: for as the first sinne was the
immoderate and presumptuous desire of knowledge,
eritis sicut dij scientes bonum &amp; malum; so God in reuenge
of this sinne, contraria curans contrarijs, punisheth
man with the heauie yoake of ignorance,The reasonable and vnderstanding soule knowes not her selfe. yea,
of the ignorance of himselfe; which herein seemes to
bee more intolerable, considering that man still retaines,
as the same corrupt nature, so the same immoderate
desire of knowledge. Let the naturalist here confesse,
that since God hath herein been more mercifull

to other creatures, then vnto man, therefore this hath
befallen man since the first institution of his nature, as
a punishment for some offence: and since euery facultie
hath reference and some knowledge of his obiect, vndoubtedly
our blindnesse and ignorance is a particular
case, contrarie to the generall current and course of nature;
and nature will not varie her course, without
great and iust occasion: the beleeuing man will easilie
acknowledge this, considering that Adam before his
fall, was able to giue a name to euery creature, answerable
to his propertie; and the vnbeleeuing man, by the
light of his owne reason, shall be inforced to the same
confession.
            Giue me yet leaue to insist in one thing; Nature hath
made man aboue all other creatures, the most sociable,
(as appeares) in that man cannot subsist without a common-wealth,
without lawes, without gouernment, and
the like; and yet in this one poynt of association, you
shall finde man, aboue all other creatures the most vntractable:
hence it is, that hee must frame and square
out his life by art,Morall Philosophie supposeth mans fall. morall Philosophie must guide and
direct him; for if yee looke into the soule, ye shall onely
finde one generall and obscure principle, which is this
in effect, quod tibi non vis fieri▪ alterine feceris, doe not
that to another, which thou wouldest not haue done
to thy selfe; whereas all other creatures doe accompanie
together, without any teaching or precepts of arts, onely
by their owne naturall inclination. Thus then you
see, that the foundation of all arts and sciences seemes
to lay this for a ground-worke, the fall and corruption
of man; that notwithstanding his birth-right, the dignitie
of his nature, the high prerogatiue of his state; yet
in most of his actions, you shall finde him much defectiue,
farre inferior to the condition of all other creatures,
cleane contrarie to the common course and current

of nature, and therefore you cannot conceiue, but
that his corruption hath crept into nature since the first
institution thereof.
            Not onely the occasion and first grounds of all sciences
and arts doe testifie mans fall, but likewise many
particular opinions doe poynt out this truth (whereof I
will forbeare to speake); assuredly they had an implicite
knowledge concealed as a misterie,The complaint of Philosophers against nature. though not openly
knowne in expresse tearmes: for otherwise you should
neuer heare such complaints and accusations made against
nature; that she was a step-mother, and rather intended
the destruction of man, then to commiserate
the poore wretched estate of man. You should neuer
haue seene them so much abhorre the actions of nature,
as it were ashamed of their owne nature; for not onely
the faithfull and beleeuing men haue hated and detested
their owne flesh, strugling and contending with
nature▪ euen here in her owne denne▪ denying vnto
themselues all the pleasures and delights of this world;
but likewise Heathen, Pagans, Infidels, they haue beene
in some sort (as I may so say) very mortified men, and
God hath rewarded them accordingly: whether it
were for our example, the rather to stirre vs vp to the
like actions; or God louing the thing, hee did likewise
loue the shadow of it, and reward it with temporall
happinesse, which is the shadow of our true happinesse.
Thus it pleaseth God to require morall vertues with
morall blessings; the Midwiues of Egypt for sparing
the Israelites, they shall finde fauour, &amp;c. If some there
were who did delight in vncleannesse, and would denie
the corruption, then here acknowledge the corruption
of man, in this deniall of his corruption; that he is borne
in a prison, borne in darkenesse, that as yet he hath neuer
seene light, or tasted any true happinesse; and therefore
supposeth his owne slauish and base condition, to bee

the height and scope of his birth-right: and surely God
for the punishment of mans curiositie, hath so fitly ordained
it, that the knowledge of nature should be fully
and exactly perfited by some higher knowledge (sacred
Theologie) which he himself would reueale.The Metaphysicks are very imperfect. As you see,
there is an order in arts, the principles of one are here
presupposed, yet confirmed by the strength of a superior
art, which as a Lady or mistres directs the inferior;
for it cannot bee denied, but that of all other parts of
Philosophie, the Metaphysicks (wherein the fall of man
together with the institution of his nature, might fitly
haue been handled) are the most imperfect; in so much,
that in reading the Metaphysicks, we seeme to leese Aristotle
in Aristotles owne workes; and since his time,
not any man (to my knowledge) was euer able to reduce
the Metaphysicks, to the strict forme of a Science.
            From the theorie of Philosophie, let vs come to the
practicall part; it is not vnknowne to the Chimicks in
their distillations (whose office it is, secornere purum ab
impuro, validum ab inualid
                     •
                  ,
               How nature is corrupted appeares by Chimicall operations. to make a separation of
such things as corrupted nature hath alreadie vnited,
either of the good substance from the dross
                  •
               , or of the
wholesome and sound medicine from the poysonous
infection) that all malignitie and poyson consists onely
in the vpper crust of things, in rerum superficie; the deeper
you diue into the substance of any creature, the
more you shall acknowledge the goodnesse and perfection
of the creature: as if they did discerne in nature,
that all things in their owne proper essence were good,
not onely as they are creatures, but as they are ordained
for mans vse and seruice; in their owne roote, and
in their first ground of nature they are freed and priueledged
from all poyson and infection; only some afterchance,
some ill husbandman came, who after the sowing
of the good wheate, did sowe his own cockle. Thus

the euill in nature, could not together subsist with the
first ordination of nature: for proofe whereof you shall
obserue, that the first thing which euaporates, and cannot
by any meanes endure the triall of the fire, is that
poysonous matter, which flies at first sight, at the first
approach and encounter, as being guiltie to it selfe, harboured
in anothers nest, and therefore dares not iustifie
it selfe; desiring to auoide the pursuite and chase, and
to saue it selfe with his owne slight. And hence it is,
that all the preparation of our meate, not onely for the
rawnesse, but likewise for the poyson and infection, is to
be performed by the vse and ministerie of fire; as it were
prefiguring, that at the generall combustion of this
world, there should bee the purifying and cleansing of
all the elements, euery thing shall be refined, fire it selfe
shall be purged by fire, and nature shall bee restored to
her first perfection and integritie.
            Thus by the Chimicall operations it appeares, that
the euill and poyson of creatures hath polluted nature,
since the first institution thereof; now if you please to
compare these good and euill qualities together,Chi
                     •
                  istrie shewes the ouerflowing of euill. it will
be manifest, that the euill hath farre surpassed the good
by many degrees; and therefore doe vndoubtedly conclude,
that whole nature is corrupted, for in their extractions,
their best and purest substance hath onely a
limited goodnesse, and serues onely for some vse and
purposes; but for the drosse, or ill substance, they deeme
it wholy vnprofitable: and had it not beene a former
subiect, to vphold the better qualities; were it not, as a
stocke, reserued to fill vp some place and roome in nature,
they would iudge it to be simplie euill. And thus
by their Chimicall workes they doe easily discerne that
this euill hath crept into▪ nature; and being once admitted
and harboured in nature, this euill seemes in a large
measure, to ouerflowe and surpasse the better qualities

of nature; yet here is our comfort, that as wee are able
by the force and violence of fire, to separate the drosse
from the good substance, so this euill which hath now
corrupted nature, is not of the essence of nature, but nature
shall at length subsist, by vertue of Gods powerfull
and quickening spirit, without this her malignitie.
            As the Philosophers afforded some proofes of this
fall, deriued from the reasonable soule, her faculties, and
all the workes of nature;Proofes of the fall of Man borrowed from Poetrie. so for the body and sense, I
will make bolde to borrow some arguments from the
Poets; who were indeede their ancient and first diuines,
such as were best acquainted with the religion of the
Heathen, and hence they are called, diuini Poetae: many
of their fables had some reference to the truth of a historie
in scripture; for as truth is most ancient, so falsehood
would seeme to bee the shadow of truth, and to
accompanie her; thus all their sacrifices and rites carried
some shew and resemblance of the sacrifices and
ceremonies ordained by Moses. As for example, among
the Iewes themselues, you shall finde some spice
of this corruption; a brasen serpent was appointed as a
meanes to cure their wounds, and they fell at length to
worship this Serpent; a Calfe was slaine in sacrifice to
pacifie God, and in token hereof, they set vp a golden
Calfe for idolatrie: now if this happened to the Iewes
(Gods chosen people), who had the custodie of the law,
together with a continued succession of Prophets; then
what might be thought of the Gentiles? let vs therefore
search among their Poets, what proofes and euidences
there are yet extant of mans fall and corruption.
            Certaine it is that they deriued their linage from the
Gods, and they generally held that the soule was diuinae
particulaaurae; and yet immediatly they forbeare not
to speake of the warres, which past betweene the gods
and the gyants, which well argues the opposition and

defiance betweene the heauen and the earth; as likewise
of the strange opposition betweene the flesh and
the spirit, wherein the flesh seemes to conquer and vanquish,
(hauing the stronger faction, and being more
powerfull ouer the will &amp; inclination of man),—video
meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor. And generally for
the whole state of man, it was the common complaint
of those times, that the world did daily degenerate,
Aetas parentum peior auis, tulit nos nequiores mox daturos
progeniem vitiosiorem: when the Poets so often
mention the golden age,The golden age did signifie Paradise. what doe they else, but
point out the state of mans first happinesse, integritie,
and innocencie? there they did conuerse with their
gods, for their gods did inhabit in groues, gardens, and
fountaines, as if man did then leese God, when hee left
the garden of Paradise; quorum nascuntur in hortis
numina, this is not to be vnderstoode of garlike or onions,
but whose gods are as ancient, as was their state in
the garden; then men were numbred among the gods,
to shew the conformitie of their wils, or as our diuines
holde, there should haue been no death in Paradise, but
some happie translation: then men liued free from the
sweate of their browes, contentique cibis nullo cogente
creat is; there was a sweete contentment and quietnesse
of minde, free from the disturbance of the bodie, the
fruites of the earth were not gotten with labour, nature
was not inforced, the creation did still seeme to be continued
in the production of creatures.
            Would yee see the first sin of the first man, shadowed
forth in a fable? Daeda

                  us would needes be flying, but

fall: man in the pride of his owne heart, would eleuate
and raise himselfe aboue the state and condition
wherein he was first created; 
                  
                     •
                  ritis sicut dij, yee shall be

aimes at; now marke his downefall, praecipitium, the
breakenecke of man, yee shall not dij, but die like the
beasts of the fielde; here is the fruite of his pride, but
where is the curiositie of his knowledge? Prometheus
steales fire from Heauen, fire may fitly be resembled to
knowledge, it kindleth, it lighteneth, it purgeth, and is
the highest and purest element; these properties may
well be agreeable to knowledge, though not to the curiositie
of knowledge, but marke the euent, Hinc noua
febrium terris incubuit cohors, as if the sentence w
                  •
               re
past, morte morieris, thou shalt die the death, here you
see man in himselfe. Now for the rebellion of the creatures,
Actaeon hauing seene Diana, the goddesse of
wisdome naked with her nimphes, straight he becomes
a prey to his owne dogges; now for the nature of man,
how it is altered and changed, Deucalion is said to haue
made men of the stones; here you may see a new
mould, a hard and flintie complexion: to conclude, obserue
their pleasures in the Elisian fields, and you shall
finde some reference to the garden of Paradise; obserue
their paines in hell, and you shall see the punishment of
sinne set sorth in a glasse: wherefore should this be assigned
vnto Tantalus, vt poma fugacia captet? were it
not for the iustice and satisfaction of some offence,
committed in the vniust vsurpation of some forbidden
fruite.
            Thus I hope by the light of our corrupted reason, it
hath already sufficiently appeared, not onely to vs Christians,
to whom our vndoubted beleefe, which first wee
receiued by faith,The conclusion of this third part. might in processe of time seeme a naturall
knowledge, and so wholly possesse man, as if it
were imprinted in mans owne heart; but likewise to the
ancient Philosophers, who were without the knowledge
of the true God, by the force of their owne
reason; as likewise to the ancient Poets, in their

fables and shadowes, hauing first receiued it by tradition;
that many things doe daily befall man, which
could not happen in the first integritie and institution
of his nature: and were they not inflicted on man, as
the iust punishments of sin, it could not stand with the
goodnesse and iustice of the Deitie, to impose them.
The consideration whereof may fitly informe vs, first,
of the state wherein we are fixed, a miserable and sinfull
state; and the hope of our happinesse whereunto euery
man should aspire, not to consist within the pre
                  •
               incts
of this earthly tabernacle; but to extend it selfe to a
more eminent state of a higher nature and condition:
secondly, reason discerning mans fall, it may serue as an
abatement to our pride, that we might not presume too
farre to prie into the high mysteries of Christian religion;
considering that corruption hath ouerwhelmed
the whole man, together with all his faculties both sensuall
and intellectuall; and therefore hee cannot raise
himselfe of himselfe, when as the ground-worke and
foundation which sustaines the whole building, is
wholly corrupted: thirdly, as the first fall of man gaue
way and occasion to the whole course of Christian religion;
so reason discerning this fall, giues some testimonie
to our Christian faith, and as farre forth as shee
can, laies the foundation, prepares the way to religion;
that so the truth of nature might beare witnesse to the
truth of grace, the one supporting the other, the one
tending and ending in the other.
            Here I can do no lesse, then magnifie the wonderfull
prouidence and goodnesse of God: for as the knowledge
of a disease is the first degree to the cure;How this corruption of nature serues to instruct vs. so man
by his owne nature, seeing and discerning the corruption
of his nature, loathing, abhorring, and detesting
this corruption, might take some dislike with himselfe;
seeke for some helpe, search for remedie and ease, enquire

for the Physitian. Hee that opened our eyes to see
the corruption, certainely intended our cure: can wee
conceiue in reason that wee should bee thus left to our
selues, left destitute of all possible meanes to relieue vs?
that God in his mercy (hauing first made vs of nothing)
should, notwithstanding that mercy, suffer vs againe to
fall vnto nothing? it cannot be, it cannot be, here then
I will first conceiue hope, and rousing vp my spirits, I
will say with the Prophet, Ieremie 8. 22. Nonne est resina
in Gilead? Is there not balme at Gilead? Though I
am inwardly sicke at the heart (for all the faculties and
powers of my soule are corrupted); though I am outwardly
sore wounded (for all the actions of my bodie
are tainted); yet here is my comfort, there is balme in
Gilead, there is balme in Gilead, and balme hath this
propertie, that it may bee taken both inwardly as a soueraigne
medicine to heale my maladies, and outwardly
it may bee poured into my wounds, as an excellent
salue, to cure my infirmities; here then I see there are
sufficient meanes for my recouerie, why should I perish?
But where at length shall I finde the Physitian?

any man did euer open the eyes of him that was borne
blinde. I must therefore ascend to some higher power,

            The Corollarie.
            
               IN the former treatise I did not only
tie my selfe to speake of the Subiect,
which was ye fall of Man, the
generall corruptiō of nature, how
creatures haue declined by degrees
since their first beginning,
and institution; but likewise to
proceed in such manner &amp; forme,Why the Author adioyned this Corollary.
as that my proofes might serue to inforce the naturall
man by the light of his owne reason, to confesse his
owne corruption. Now lest I might seeme to be wanting,
or defectiue to my intended scope; lest I might
seeme to confound the fall of man, with the manner, circumstances,
and accidencies of his fall and tentation;
therefore I thought fit to ioyne this present Corollarie
to the Treatise, making it to differ from the rest of the
parts: for here I must ingeniously and truly confesse;
though mans knowledge discerneth his fall, yet by the
same knowledge he cannot possibly conceiue the manner
of his fall. For in Christian religion, such things as
belong to our knowledge, I will ranke in three seuerall
orders: First, some things there are wherein nature her
selfe may informe vs, viz. to condemne the corruption
of our owne flesh, to practise the Morall law, &amp;c. Secondly,
some things there are, which though not appearing
to reason at first sight, yet being supposed, and
examined by reason, they shal be found most probable,

and most agreeable to the grounds of reason. Thirdly,
some things are of a higher degree, much aboue the
reach or comprehension of reason, as are the secret and
hidden mysteries of faith; and heerein reason being
naturally taught to humble her selfe, shal acknowledge
her owne darknesse, and these things infinitly to transcend
her naturall power.
            To the second ranke and condition of things, I will
referre the manner of mans fall, which reason cannot
apprehend of her selfe, for it supposeth matter of historie;
and this wee receiue not by our owne discoursiue
reason, but only by report and tradition from others. In
this historicall narration of mans fall, we must conceiue
the free-will and election of God; which being no way
determinated,Why by our reason we can not conceiue the manner of mans fall. might impose lawes at his pleasure; then
the free consent of mans will, which according to
the circumstances, and present occasions, might incurre
the breach of those lawes; for punishment whereof, the
iustice of God might bee allaied and tempered with
mercie, according to Gods owne appointment, without
any certaine measure or rule. Thus many wayes
supposing the free-will, and election, both in the law-giuer,
and in the offender, in the inuisible God, and in
the visible creature; we can no more iudge of our selues,
or (as I may so say) prophecy of their forepassed actions,
then others can now probably gesse or cōiecture at our
future contingent euents; for things which are not limited
in nature, reason cannot prescribe a certaine determinate
course, for their limitation.
            As in generall for the whole scope and truth of Christian
religion, so in particular for this, and all other accidents,
notwithstanding our ignorance,How we may be assured of the manner o
                     •
                   mans 
                     •
                  all. yet the vnconstant
and wauering minde of man, may finde staiednes,
and be safely built vpon a sure rocke and foundation;
examining those grounds and assurances, which wee

haue for our Christian faith, whereby the naturall and
distrustfull man, is fully resolued and perswaded by
signes, working of miracles, euents of prophecies, truth
of histories, succession of times, the immediate and special
prouidence of God, whereby his Church hath continually
been preserued, and all other sects and schismes
scattered and dissolued, and could neuer endure the
touch-stone; insomuch that I may well say with Gamaliel,
Act. 5. 39. If this truth be of God, then who can
resist it? Whereunto I will adde the generall consent
and verdict of the whole world, of Iewes, Gentiles,
Turkes▪ &amp;c. when as religion her selfe, makes but one
body of faith; the seuerall parts and mysteries whereof,
as they are directed to each other, so they serue to
strengthen each other. I shall not neede to bring miracles
to confirme euery point of our faith; much lesse
must wee expect miracles vpon all occasions,How we must expect miracles. for this
were to tempt and prouoke God; we must make a difference
betweene laying the first foundations, and the
continuance of the building: the needle must first passe
thorow, that the thread may follow after, and thē there
is no further vse of the needle. Miracles must first introduce
faith, and lay the foundation; then must the building
be perfected, by the practise of pietie and deuotion;
if wee should continually expect miracles, then
faith should lose her reward, as S. Gregorie saith, Fides
non habet meritum, cui humana ratio indies praebet experimentum.
Doest thou still desire to be an eye-witnesse
of miracles, and yeeldest nothing to the report and relation
of others? heerein thou must condemne thine
own falsehood, when thou canst not require that others
should giue more credit to thee, then thou doest to others;
though miracles haue failed, yet wonders are stil
extant; for a wonder it is to see thy infidelitie, as Saint
Augustine saith, Si quis adhuc prodigia (vt credat) inquirit,

magnum prodigium est qui mundo cred
                     •
                  ate non
credit.
            
            For the manner of mans fall, as I purpose to giue full
contentment to the naturall man, as farre foorth as it
lies in my power; so it shall appeare that nothing therein
is related by Moses, which might any way seeme
absurd or improbable; and in many things, I will vse the
same weapons of reason, which formerly I haue done;
that so by demonstratiue arguments, I might satisfie
the vnbeleeuing man. First for the vndoubted truth of
our creation, that the world was created of nothing,
which in effect is to proue that there is a God, &amp; a Maker:
as euery thing in nature will necessarily inforce a
creation, so euery argument and proofe in mans braine,
will easily conuince this truth. I doe heartily wish, that
my tongue may cleaue to the roofe of my mouth, if euer
I be found destitute of arguments in this kind; and
let my right hand forget her cunning, if I be not able in
euery creature to poynt out the footsteps of the Deitie.Proofes of the Deitie and the creation.
In this infinite number of arguments, I will onely make
choice of these foure, which I suppose to be inuincible,
to confirme this truth: First, if it seemes strange to mans
vnderstanding (which as it is a naturall vnderstanding,
so doth it onely respect the present course and order of
nature) that a thing should be the cause of his owne being,
and hauing no beginning of existencie, should deriue
his roote from eternitie. Then certainly in things
which are inconuenient, the least inconuenience is to
be admitted in reason: either euery thing in his owne
kinde, must be the cause and author of his owne being;
or onely one thing, which being infinite, and all sufficient
in it selfe, must giue a nature and essence to all other
existing creatures. Now as is the difference betweene
many and one, so is the inconuenience lesse, and
therefore to be admitted in reason.
            
               Secondly,Reason in vnreasonable creatures. things onely sensible seeme to worke according
to reason: The birds in building their nests, in
making their prouision, against the hard season; the
wilde beasts in their dennes &amp; their caues, in the choice
of their foode, and in a subtiltie and craft for defence of
themselues; the stockes and the stones in desiring and
seeking their proper places, as being fittest for their
preseruation; and generally in the dumbe creatures
there is a naturall prouidence and instinct for the protection
and gouernment of themselues: heere you see
the actions of reason, in vnreasonable creatures, which
therefore cannot proceed from themselues; neither are
these in themselues alone, but likewise in relation to others.
Thus one thing seemes to bee ordained for another,
euery facultie hath his seuerall obiect proportioned
to it selfe; and in euery kinde there is a difference
of sexe, the one being fitted and referred to the other.
The Sunne is in continuall motion, yet not for his owne
vse, neither knowes hee the vse of his motion, being a
bare and a dumbe instrument, yet still he moues, for the
good of this inferiour world: and therfore these things
subsist not of themselues seuerally, but were thus constituted,
and appointed by some higher supereminent
and intellectiue Agent, who did foresee and ordain the
power of each other, and had the perfect knowledge of
both, that so the inuisible Deitie might appeare by the
visible creatures.
            Thirdly, supposing that the world had no beginning,
but that all things were from eternitie;Impossibilities in the worlds eternitie. then must it
follow, that whereas the course of the Sunne containes
thirteene reuolutions of the Moone, yet the Sunne
should haue as often finisht his course, as the Moone
hath changed her countenance; for both should be infinite,
which indeed implies such a contradiction &amp; impossibilitie
in nature, such as cannot be admitted. Againe,

in this inferiour world, supposing the eternitie,
no reason can be assigned of that difference, which appeares
in neighbour and bordering countries, lying vnder
the same climate; that one part should abound with
mines, more then another; or should be fitter to nourish
wilde and fierce beasts, more then another; the
temper and mould of the earth should be the same, the
properties the same, the qualities the same, as lying in
the same situation and distance from the heauens; and
yet notwithstanding there appeares a great diuersitie,
which wee cannot ascribe to any other subordinate
cause, but onely to the roote and first institution of nature,
that things were thus created different from the
beginning.
            Fourthly, euery thing giuing it selfe his owne being,
should consequently giue vnto it selfe the best being:
thus if the creatures should subsist of themselues, there
should bee no further comparison among themselues,
but all should be best; this comparison should not only
be abolished in respect of other creatures, but likewise
in respect of their owne parts, some parts should not be
inferiour to others, but all should be best. Againe, the
qualities of creatures must be all alike bounded: for if
you will suppose that any one should be infinite, then al
must bee infinite; if any one finite, then all must bee finite;
for they must goe together hand in hand by equal
paces, and carrie a iust proportion. As for example, suppose
that a creature weake and faint in self,Accidents which would follow the worlds eternitie. should haue
an infinite continuance, then certainly would it purchase
and get vnto it selfe, by infinite degrees, an infinit
strength, and all other qualities should likewise bee infinite:
but reason, and daily experience can testifie, that
euery creature is bounded in all other qualities, finite in
extension, finite in power, finite in goodnesse, and therfore
why not finite in continuance? though wee in the

shortnes of our own liues, cannot discerne the first and
last of the creatures. We see likewise, that they haue diuersitie
of parts, some more ignoble then others, they
cannot adde to their growth, nor helpe their owne imperfections;
and in the creatures in generall, there is a
center, there is a circumference, there is a prioritie, and
posterioritie; and therefore the creatures cannot thus
subsist of themselues, nor cannot subsist from eternitie.
            I know not how farre I may presume vpon mine own
weaknesse in all other things, but truly (I do perswade
my selfe) I could be infinite in this kinde of arguments;
after these reasons,The creation of the world proued by an instance. I will bring foorth one instance to
this purpose. True it is, that there are certaine places
here appoynted by nature, for the generation and preseruation
of things: now if you shall finde any thing (as
many things there are out of their own proper wombs)
which you cannot conceiue, that the art and industrie
of man, could euer displace or transport; then assuredly
these things were thus created from the beginning: for
by the naturall course, euery thing should containe it
selfe within his owne naturall habitation and dwelling.
Againe, certaine it is in mines, that where siluer
and gold haue anciently been found, in the same place
nature was neuer able to recouer her owne strength,
and to raise vp new mines, notwithstanding the same
disposition of ye place, the same climate &amp; euery thing
alike: and therefore vndoubtedly these mettals were
not onely ingendred by a naturall course; but either the
mettals, or at least a fit seede to bring foorth these mettals,
was there created from the beginning: and this I
conceiue to be the reason, why the East countrie, which
was first inhabited, should be so much impouerished in
these daies.
            If we suppose this world to haue a beginning, that it

should be made by blind chance, that creatures should
casually meete, and by good fortune fall into such an
excellent order, as now we see things are disposed; for
mine owne part, I doe not thinke this opinion deserues
the confutation. Supposing then the truth of the creation,
I will come to the truth of that creation which is
recorded by Moses;
               The proofe of Moses his creation. and this shall appeare besides all
the miracles and wonders, wrought for the confirmation
therof, by the iust time appointed for the creation,
and by the course and order obserued in the creation. If
I shall reduce all things to a generall deluge, it is the
same in effect, as if I should bring them to the first creation;
for the same author relates both, hee deserues a
like credit in both, signes were wrought in testimonie
of both, the same omnipotent power did equally appeare
in both. Now for the time, wee must come to the
concent of histories, if you please to remember the most
ancient and first languages,The time of Moses his creation. as Hebrew, Chaldaike, &amp;c.
and how other tongues doe borrow some proprietie
from thē: if you will consider the first Monarchies and
gouernments, how nations haue issued out of nations,
and haue deriued their customes and manners; if you
will obserue where the world first began to be inhabited,
and how vpō the multiplying of people, men were
inforced to se
                  •
               ke out forraine habitations; together
with the inuentions of all Arts and Sciences, which we
are able to point out, and their first authors; the building
of Cities, Townes, and such other monuments and
memorials, which seeme to serue for eternitie; the iust
computation of yeeres, and times; the first great battels
and warres betweene nations; the first Histories, Philosophers,
and Poets which are extant, and such other remarkable
accidents; you may vndoubtedly conclude,
that all these doe point out one and the same instant
time, which serues for the birth and natiuitie of this

world; beyond whose circuit and comprehension, no
author, no monument, no memorie is extant; and to
this iust period of time, all Histories, sacred and prophane,
doe together ioyntly conspire, and witnesse one
and the same truth of the creation, here described by
Moses.
            
            There are likewise reliques in nature, which may
seeme in some measure to point out the same time of
the creation; if yee consider the daily decay of nature,
and haue relation to the seuerall degrees of this decay,An instance to proue the time of the creatiō.
you may in some sort gesse at the birth and beginning
of nature. Suppose wee were vpon the highest mountaines,
then thus I would argue; that mountaines vndoubtedly
were from the beginning, or at least from
the deluge, for since that time the face of the earth was
neuer changed or altered. Here I would make a diligent
search and inquisition for fountaines, and springs;
for so it pleaseth God to moysten the drie and high hils
with sweete waters. Now fountaines (I confesse) may
both begin and cease in one age; for as many things
may cause their production, so many things may stop or
hinder their passage; as immoderate drought, great
earthquakes, boysterous winds, trenches made by mans
labour, the growing vp of young springs, woods, and
the like: I would not therefore much insist in the fountaines,
but thus I might conclude in reason, that from
the beginning, there hath bin alwaies the same fall and
descent of waters; then let vs conceiue what surrowes
and gutters the fall of waters hath made, and looking to
the difference which might happen in any one age, wee
cannot suppose, but that the world was created much
about that time, which is related by Moses.
            
            From the time, I come to the manner of this creation,
and Gods order in framing; wherein if I should
not impose my selfe silence, I thinke my whole life

would hardly suffice to speake of this Subiect; for here
is seminarium Philosophiae, some things ought to be referred
to the honestie, credit, and truth of the reporter.
It is not vnknowne to those, who are acquainted with
the course of our Vniuersities, that before wee professe
Theologie,Three vses of Phi
                     •
                  losophie. there is more then a prentiship spent in the
studie of humane arts and sciences; especially of Philosophie,
for the vpshot and conclusion whereof, wee
propose vnto our selues these three seuerall vses: first, to
acknowledge the inuisible God, in the visible creatures;
to beholde the wisdome, goodnesse, and power of the
maker, in the framing and disposing of nature; the
workemanship giues testimonie of the workeman,
O all yee workes of the Lord, blesse yee the Lord, praise
him, and magnifie him for euer: Secondly, to consider
how God hath layed the foundations of nature to support
the beautifull buildings of grace; wherein consists
the agreement, and wherein the opposition; how the
dumbe creatures (without change or alteration of
their naturall proprietie) are sanctified, and sometimes
made the meanes and conduit-pipes of grace, by Gods
owne institution, and the powerfull assistance of his
spirit: Thirdly, as we desire to confirme the groundes
and principles of Philosophie, by the rule and square of
Diuinitie: so wee examine all the seuerall miracles of
Scripture (which serue for the confirmation of our faith,
together with all the mysteries of our faith), by the
touchstone of our humane knowledge, to see how farre
they are transcendent aboue our naturall reason, and
therein to acknowledge the height, breadth, and deapth of
Gods vnsearchable wisdome.
            
            Hereupon wee take occasion to examine this great
worke of our creation, by the rules and principles of
reason; wee doe not speake of the absolute power of
God, whereby all things were created of nothing; we

doe not dispute of the absolute will of God,The order obserued in Moses his creatiō. who might
haue vsed many infinite meanes, and might haue appointed
many infinite kindes and infinite degrees of
the creatures; but of the conformitie which creatures
had in the beginning, to the following and succeeding
course of their nature: as for example, that the heauens
and the earth should first seuerally be created; how the
confused elements were diuided; wherefore was light
first ordained, and in the fourth day the celestiall bodies
appointed, and such like. Vpon due deliberation
and examination hereof, I dare confidently auouch,
that to the iudgement of an heathen man, who hath any
knowledge of Philosophie, there could not possibly
be a more orderly and methodicall course obserued in
the creation (such as might well argue one and the
same wisdome, power, prouidence in the producing,
or birth, which now appeares in the continuance, and
preseruation of nature), then is here recorded by
Moses.
            
            Supposing the necessitie of a creation, there can bee
but one Creator, for all nature is directed to one end:
the World is circular, which best resembleth the figure
of one;There can be but one Creator. all the streames are reduced to one head, all the
degrees of things still tend to the highest (there being
in nature a prioritie &amp; posteriority), euery gouernment
tends and ends in a Monarchie. Nature will not indure
many Competitors; order and decencie requires as
much in effect, all heate is reduced to one first heate, all
bodies to one first bodie. Philosophie beates vpon this
axiome, that nature desires to worke with the fewest instruments;
and therefore euery thing is to bee reduced
to the fewest principles: in the constitution of any
thing she requires but a couple, for the effecting of any
thing one will suffice; to admit of more would rather
hinder and distract the worke, then any way further or

helpe the action. Thus to acknowledge one God, the
workemanship and fabricke of the whole world will
testifie as much in effect; wherein the footesteps and
impression of one and the same God, doe most eminently
appeare: all of them giuing sufficient demonstration
of one and the same wisdome and prouidence,
which appeares alike in all,The same wisdome appeares in all the creatures. grounding all his workes,
and all his actions, vpon the same principles and rules
of his owne wisdome. There are not gods of the mountaines,
and gods of the vallies, gods of the Land, and
gods of the Ocean; for the fishes of the sea, the birds of
the ayre, the beasts of the fielde haue alike fashion and
forme for their outward feature, and a like inward instinct
and prouidence for their course and direction:
which similitude of nature must needes proceede from
the same grounds of wisdome, the voice and verdict of
nature will likewise testifie as much; which (being to
admit some infinite power, transcending reason, and
the course of all creatures), will therefore tie it selfe to
admit of the least inconuenience; rather of one, then of
a multitude.
            From the generall creation of all things, I come vnto
man: that he was created in a more excellent manner,
then now he is, it shall not here neede any proofe; for
it was the principall intent and scope of my whole
speech. I will forbeare to speake of originall grace,
vntill I come to our sanctifying grace, which supplies
her want: I will passe ouer the degrees of his sinne, vntill
I come to the steps in his regeneration: I will not
open the wound, vntill I haue already prouided the
salue; and this I haue reserued for the third branch of
of my text. Here let vs consider the wisdome of God,
that hauing giuen an vndoubted token of his mercy in
the creation of man, imparting himselfe according to
the nature of goodnesse, calling those things which were

not, as if they were,
               The end of mans creation. inlightening their darkenesse, 
                  •
               with
the infinite lampe of his owne light; it stoode with the
same wisdome to appoint a law, (since his glorie &amp; our
obedience, was the end and scope of our creation; for
himselfe being the chiefe and greatest good, all must be
directed to him; neither could hee bereaue himselfe of
that honour, no more then he could alter or change his
owne nature); and thorough the obseruance of that
lawe, either to multiplie and increase his owne mercies,
in a further confirmation of our blisse and happinesse;
or by the breach of that lawe, to giue vs some taste of
his iustice, yet so, that the miserie of our fall, might be
some further occasion, to manifest his goodnesse. And
to this end some things were adioyned, as necessarie
and essentiall to our nature, whereof God in his mercy,
and in the constancie of his owne will, would neuer bereaue
vs; some things againe were added onely as gifts
and as ornaments, without which our nature might
subsist, and these we holde durante benè placito, during
his good pleasure and liking; that as our sinnes or deserts
should require, wee might haue them enlarged or
diminished, or indeede might bee wholly depriued. Againe,
the condition of man is such, that being a creature
he could not be independent,The condition of man. as not in his beginning,
so not in his continuance (for God cannot impart
this his owne royal prerogatiue); and being a creature
made of nothing, there still remained in this creature,
a power to returne vnto nothing: being made a
reasonable creature, and hauing a spirituall soule, he
had likewise a libertie and freedome in his own choice,
either to stand or to fall. And thus the wisdome of the
maker, and the state of man, did require as much in effect,
that man might haue a mutable and changeable
condition: whereas all other creatures which were at
first determinated by God, as they are only carried by a

naturall instinct, so in themselues they are of an inferior
degree, directed for the vse and seruice of others,
and are therefore wholie vncapable of any further
blisse. Herein did appeare the rule of Gods mercie, lest
man in the pride and presumption of his owne heart,
might obiect against God, that he was created indeed,
but onely created for Gods seruice, and therein God
might seeme to intend onely his owne honour; therefore
God hath appointed all other creatures to serue
man, that so there might be some kinde of recompence
or restitution made vnto man,Other creatures ordained for man, as man was for God. while hee himselfe, with
his continuall prouidence and power, intends the protection
and preseruation of man; and that it might for
euer appeare, that the seruice of God is more honorable
to man, then was the first appoyntment of his state and
condition, for herein consisteth the height of mans
happinesse.
            Triall being thus made of mans obedience, before I
come to the sinne, I must first speake of the tentation:
the nature of man was innocent and incorrupt, as being
Gods owne immediate workemanship,There can be no God of Euill. his condition
was great, his vnderstanding perfect and pure;
where then shall we finde the first roote, seede, and occasion
of this corruption? to make two different gods
of good &amp; of euill (with the Manichees), were to ouerthrow
both, for who should set them at difference, or
who should appoint them their bounds and limitations?
Euill wants no positiue cause, being in it selfe a
meere defect and priuation, want of light causeth darknesse,
&amp;c. or if you will suppose a fountaine of euill, then
it should suddainely dissolue it selfe, as consisting of
such contrarieties, which could neuer be reconciled: as
for example, while partialitie and oppression, should
striue to encounter each other in iudgement, and to
make themselues strong in their factions; falsehood

and lying should interpose it selfe as an vmpire, or an
aduocate, and so cunningly corrupt and suborne witnesses
and euidencies on both sides, as neither of them
should attaine to their purposes, (loe here sinne doth ouerthrow

in one golden chaine, idem volumus, idem nolumus, proceeding
from one fountaine, and not able seuerally to
subsist, directed to one end, supporting and vpholding
each other, to the vttermost of their power; Truth will
depose in the behalfe of a right; Iustice will stand in defence
of that right; Wisedome will guide and direct iustice,
and send out her Commission to Strength, for the
due execution of her lawes; Ierusalem adificatur vt ci

            Man therefore being totally sanctified; inwardly in
the faculties of his soule, outwardly in the right rule of
his senses, and the gouernment of his flesh; being thus
sanctified in the wombe, sealed vp with originall grace,Man though innocent, yet capable of euill.
yet still hee had the freedome of his will, according to
the condition of his nature; the will being immateriall,
not chained vp with any naturall instinct, but such as
did follow the direction and information of his vnderstanding;
his vnderstanding likewise though sufficiently
perfect, yet had it a certaine measure and bounds in
her perfection, (as all things finite may well admit infinite
degrees). Thus all were created good; the will
had a libertie and free election, wherby making choice
of the better part, she might deserue at Gods hands her
further confirmation in bliffe; the vnderstanding hauing
degrees, which are necessarily incident to all creatures
in generall, might in the humble submission of
her selfe, serue and please God, expecting a further illumination,
by Gods holy grace, direction and prouidence;

both will and vnderstanding were good in
themselues, yet capable of euill, and such as might bee
the occasion of our fall.
            Hitherto you see in man a power to stand, or to fall;
posse malum per velle bonum, cum vinceret Adam, posse
bonum per velle malum, sibi perdidit: There was onely a
capacitie in his minde, but for the inferiour nature of
his flesh,That God might iustly suffer man to be tempted. it was wholly sanctified; no ill fansie could appeare
in his braine, no inordinate motion in his members,
his senses not dissolute, stragling and wandring;
only according to the condition of a creature, hee was
capable of a fall, capable of transgression: which capacitie
was good in it selfe, the minde being not indifferently
affected to both, but rather inclining to good,
especially Gods assisting grace, helping and furthering
the better part. And therefore it might well stand with
Gods decree, and the course of his iustice, to suffer man
to be tempted; tempted, I say, not by his owne flesh, or
that the inward parts should conspire against man, but
to be outwardly tempted, à longè, a farre off; for hitherto
the diuell had no power ouer the body, or substance
of man▪ so as man might easily haue resisted, either with
his owne naturall strength, or by the furtherance of his
originall grace, God hauing forewarned him, giuen
him a caution, and threatned his punishment, in quocunque

                  s, morte morieris. Thus Christ himselfe
hauing a reasonable soule, and the freedom of his will,
was likewise subiect to an outward tentation.
            For proofe hereof, that man should bee outwardly
tempted, obserue the diuersity of tentations, in this corrupted
state of man:How we may discerne an outward ten

are inclined, yet the pompe and pride of this world, allures
man to sinne; and sometimes when nothing in
nature (I say nothing in corrupted nature) can moue,
yet an euil spirit, obseruing the soules actions, and therby
iudging of her disposition, considering the course
and inclination of humours, doth stir vp fit notions in
the fansie, and thereby perswades vs to sinne. As for
example, many there haue been, whom wee may well
remember with sorrow and griefe, as hauing been the
most accursed of all men, who haue offered violence to
themselues, and haue proued selfe-homicides: now let
vs search, where is the first roote of this tentation? not
in flesh and blood, for there in we finde no such inclination:
not in the pride and vanitie of this world, which
rather desires to retaine vs as slaues in her seruice, then
to manumit, or to set vs at libertie; not in whole nature,
which though neuer so much corrupted, yet she desires
life, and the preseruation of her selfe: and therefore this
tentation proceedes from some spirit, that is maleuolent
and opposite to nature, and intends nothing more
then the corruption of nature; which being not able to
effect in the whole, seekes to vndermine and supplant
each one in particular.
            Man being outwardly tempted, could not be the first
cause of sinne; by the streames then I will trace out the
fountaine; and heere I will make a diligent search for
that,Where wee might finde the first fountaine of sinne. which I could wish had neuer been found, I meane
the first roote and occasion of sinne, where sinne should
take the beginning; lower then the state of man I cannot
descend, for wherein there is no freedome of will,
(that creatures may in some sort be left to themselues),
there can bee no power or abilitie to sinne: and as waters
cannot ascend higher, then are the heads of the
fountaines; so earthly contagions arising from dumbe
creatures, cannot deface Gods image. Now this is

strange, that I should looke vp, and aboue man for that,
which brings man downe, and beneath himselfe; yet
this I must doe, for thus sinne may alter and change our
condition. I haue alreadie proued that there could bee
no God of sinne, no God of euill, which is euident by
considering the properties of euill in it selfe: I must
therefore come to those creatures, which seeme to bee
placed in degree betweene God and man; and these are
the angelicall spirits, whom I do the rather accuse, considering
that in man himselfe (though body and soule,
are both tainted with sin), yet the sinne it selfe seemes
first to proceede from the soule and spirit of man, as being
more capable, and therefore more culpable: here
then I must blame and charge the created spirits to
haue been the first fountaines of euill, and first to haue
infected the world with corruption.
            Here wee must consider the different condition of
creatures, some bodies, some spirits, as euery thing is
compounded of matter and forme, and the forme it is
which giues the existencie, and indiuiduation: these
seuerall degrees of creatures make much for the absolute
perfection of nature; especially when as all bodies
seeme to bee contained and continued within the circumference
of the first body: what should we thinke, is
aboue the conuexitie of the heauens? an infinite vacuum?
rather acknowledge a want in mans vnderstanding,
then that there should want inhabitants in such
an excellent region; where the heauens are their footstooles,
to tread and walke ouer our heads, where they
are freed from all annoyance of creatures, and partake
only of happinesse. As in great buildings, the meanest
and basest offices are alwaies beneath, (suppose the
Kitchin, the Seller, the Buttrie, the Pantrie); but for the
stately and magnificent roomes for entertainment (suppose
the dining Chamber, the Galleries, the Turrets),

and places of pleasure, these are aboue: and thus it is
with vs in respect of the Angels, the truth and certaintie
whereof I haue already proued in the first part. Now
supposing these spirits, their condition must bee alike
with ours, who are in some sort, and in the better part
spirituall: as they were made of nothing, so they must

                  •
               aue a determinate goodnesse in their nature, faculties,
&amp; actions;The Angels might fa
                     •
                  l. being spirits, they had a freedom of wil: God
did herein make them like vnto himselfe, as he was able
to create of nothing, so they might will, when as nothing
should moue them to will; and hauing a limited
vnderstanding, which might admit error and darknes,
through their own pride, they might will nothing, that
is, they might will sinne; for sinne is a defect, a priuation,
a kinde of nothing: in this their willing, although
they could not will themselues, to bee nothing, to destroy
their owne condition, for this were to vndoe that,
which God alreadie hath done; yet they could will, or
rather bewitch themselues, to bee worse then nothing,
for sinne is nothing, and to be the seruant of sinne, it is
to be worse then nothing. Thus in the Angels, as well
as in man, in regard of their limited goodnesse, and the
freedome of their willes, there was a power, and capacitie
(or rather a weakenesse and impotencie) to sinne,
and to fall.
            And many of them sinned accordingly, God in his
wisedome permitting the sinne, and thereby teaching
all creatures what they are in themselues:The fall of the Angels. for as in the
same kind of spirits, the best creatures are extant, so the
worst and most accursed should likewise be found, that
no creature might boast of an absolute perfection; that
euery one might know himselfe, and suspect his owne
fall, and that all our righteousn

can endure Gods triall and touch-stone, for the

Angels are not acquitted in his sight, &amp;c. Now their sin
was a dislike of their present condition, and the aspiring
to be equall, and like to their Maker; made of nothing,
hauing nothing of themselues, yet they must
contest with their infinite Maker, for dignitie and superioritie:
whether it were that they did consider, that
there were three persons in one most holy, blessed, and
vndiuided Trinitie,Coniectures what migh

                   moue the Angels to sinne. which being a mysterie farre transcending
the reach of all creatures, they could not comprehend
(for fully to comprehend God, is indeed to be
God); but might happily conceiue, that the Deitie
would admit of more persons: or whether by 
                  •

                  •
               ther,
that as the creation was a worke of Gods infinite
loue, and as God was existent euery where, according
to the infinite extent of his owne nature; so as an infinite
effect of that infinite loue, God should tye vnto
himselfe some creature, by an infinite band, namely by
an hypostaticall vnion; and therefore some of them did
claime and challenge this high prerogatiue aboue other
creatures, by vertue of their birth-right. But herein
did appeare their ignorance and pride, for the creature
was not to aspire to the height and dignitie of the
Creator, but the Creator was to descend to the humilitie
and basenes of the creature; neither was God to bee
vnited to the angelicall nature (though otherwise highest
in order and condition), but to descend lower, to
giue a more vndoubted token of that infinit loue, euen
to the humane nature and manhood. Mans nature being
the center in the middest of the circumference; a
little Microcosme, in whom all the creatures are vnited,
things sensible partake in his body, the intelligent
spirits are combinde in his soule: and thus God taking
the nature of man, sits in the very middest of his creatures,
imparting himselfe infinitly to all, so farre foorth

as it may well stand with the truth of his Godhead, and
with the state and condition of the creature.
            Thus they might mistake in iudgement, supposing
there might be some probabilitie to effect it: but I must
chiefly and principally condemne their vnthankfulnes,The sinne of the Angels was vnpardonable.
their pride, their presumption, which gaue way and occasion
to this their error: but hauing once committed
so great a cōtempt, such a foule indignitie against God,
it could not stand with his iustice freely to pardon their
sinne, or to intend the meanes of their redemption, as
in his mercie hee hath performed to man; for the Angels
were the first creatures, highest in dignitie and
condition; the great measure of their knowledge and
graces was such, as that we doe not reade that God did
euer appoint them lawes, but that it might bee supposed
that they of themselues should bee wholly conformable
to God. Againe, they were not tempted by others,
and therefore as the sinne could no way bee cast
vpon others; so being impotent of themselues to make
any recompence, they could no way receiue benefit
by the satisfaction of others: the state of the Angels
was created such, as that they were not capable of repentance,
they cannot change their mindes, or their
willes; whatsoeuer they see, they see in an instant, whatsoeuer
they desire, their will is confinde to the first motion,
that they cannot alter or change their desire; so
that, if once they shall make choice of the worser part,
in vaine may we expect, that euer they should returne
to the better.Man may repent, but the Angels can not. Whereas the condition of man is mutable
and changeable, as capable of sinne, so capable of
repentance; as hee falles of himselfe, so hee may rise againe
by the assistance of grace; for God hath giuen
him a discoursiue reason, proceeding by degrees; if
now hee mistakes himselfe, hereafter hee may bee better
informed. As the inconstancie of his nature may

cause the alteration of his will, so God fitly vsing this
his inconstancie (as it were working in euery thing, according
to that manner which is most proper and naturall
to the thing), may make it a meanes for the amendment
and conuersion of man; especially being
tempted by others, laying hold on Gods mercie, hee
might receiue the full satisfaction for his sinnes, by the
meanes and passion of another.
            I doe not heere purpose to speake of the creation of
Angels, their nature, their office, their blessings, their
cursings, I wil only speake of them so farre forth as they
concerne man. Supposing then that some of them fell,
and some of them stood, some reprobated and cast
into darkenesse, some sealed and confirmed in goodnesse;
most certaine it is, that all creatures in generall,
as they haue, what they haue, onely from God, so are
they tied to his seruice and ministerie: now in the good
Angels, God requires not onely the free oblation of
themselues,The office and ministerie of Angels. but likewise as they are vessels of mercie
in themselues, so they should be Gods instruments of
mercie to others; but in the euill Angels, as the power
of Gods iustice appeares in their reprobation, so hee
ordaines them, to bee the fire-brands of his iustice:
onely with this difference, God stirres vp the good
Angels, ioynes with them in the action, and giues them
the high dignitie to bee his fellow-workemen and labourers;
but in the euill Angels, there is sometimes
onely a bare permission of God, sometimes a power
inforcing the execution of iustice; but alwaies a prouidence,
so to limit and bound the actions, that it might
appeare, that the iustice proceeds from God, the malignitie
from themselues. Thus the execution of iustice,
the torturing of others, discouers their owne crueltie,
their vncompassionate heart, their malice, their enuie
against God and his creatures; and these are sinnes

which must be punished againe in the instruments, and
therfore according to the rule of Gods iustice, these
euill spirits in tormenting others, themselues are likewise
tormented.
            This diuersitie of Angels, some good and some bad,
the generall consent of the whole world seems to confirme;
which hath alwaies acknowledged, and put a
difference betweene bonus genius,
               The difference of good and bad Angels. and malus genius.
But hearke, doe you not heare the Oracles speaking so
doubtfully; yea sometimes so maliciously, as may well
argue the truth of a spirit, though otherwise the spirit
of vntruth, falsehood, and wrong? If your hearing faile
you, then behold the strange delusions and strong apparitions,
which from time to time haue been discouered
to all nations; whereof the naturall Philosopher can
assigne no reason, and therefore must vndoubtedly flye
to causes beyond the precincts of nature. If sight and
hearing faile, yet life cannot subsist without touch, neither
is there any sense of that certaintie: I pray' let vs
trie this truth by this touch-stone, let vs haue a feeling
of other mens miseries: some there are which are possessed
with diuels, others bewitched: if any one doubt
of this truth, let him know that Scripture doth warrant
it, reason and experience confirmes it; how is it possible
that the body of man should be heauier, then if it did
only consist of pure lead? can the spirits be so dull, the
heate so allaied, and that onely by the ordinarie course
of nature? how should the minde presage euil to come,
without the helpe of some diuining spirit? how should
they speake languages, wherein they were neuer instructed?
All natiōs in the world can testifie this; all the
lawes in the world, whether amongst Iewes, Gentiles,
or Christians, doe witnesse it; daily experience confirmes
it: and for any man to embrace his owne priuate
and particular opinion, before the generall receiued

truth of the whole world, it is to play the pure Sectary,
&amp;c.
            Thus by the meditation of Gods iudgement, as likewise
by outward and more manifest signes and tokens,
appeares the truth and certaintie of these euill spirits.
Now for the tentation, I will first lay downe this for a
ground-worke; that as all bodies are contained within
the circumference of one first bodie; all the elements
adiacent and contiguous together, the fire it selfe next
and immediatly vnder the spheare of the Moone, (and
therefore this world carries a round figure, the forme of
a Globe, that all things might be better prest and compacted
together): so it stood with the vnitie and identitie
of one &amp; the same God, that all his creatures should
be linckt and tyed together,How all the creatures are knit together. to betoken and point out
one workman. Thus he himselfe sitting aboue, and insfinitly
transcending all creatures, the holy Angels as
they draw neerer and neerer his throne, so doe they admit
degrees in their order, and make one perfect Hierarchie.
The Angels are knit to this visible world, by
the mediation of man, who consists of spirit and flesh;
man here conuerseth with the dumbe creatures, takes
them for his foode, vseth them for his labour. Now beneath
all these creatures (as it is credibly supposed), in
the heart or center of the earth there is the place of Hel,
where the euill spirits are tormented, as in their owne
habitation and dwelling; God hauing excommunicated
thē, he appointed a place best befitting their pride,
most remote, and in the furthest distance from himself;
to teach all the creatures, that notwithstanding their
naturall right and dignitie, yet it lies in his power to
cast them downe, to deiect them, and to make them the
basest in degree and condition. Here then you see all
the creatures knit together: now this order appeares,
not onely in place and precedencie, (as I may so say)

but likewise in the mutuall actions receiued from each
other.Why God did suffer man to be tempted. In the visible world it sufficiently appeares, for al
are directed to man; now in respect of the Angels, as it
hath pleased God to appoint the good Angels to bee
our guardians and protectors; so in his iustice, hee permits
the euill Angels, to bee the tempters and tormenters
of man; for thus it stoode with the wisdome of
God being dishonored by the Angels, to make a new
triall of mans obedience, whom he created in place of
the Angels (to accomplish the number of his elect), to
see whether man would grow wise by their fall; and for
default of mans strength, hee purposed to ingage himselfe
in the quarell. Thus he suffers man to be tempted,
vntill in his due time, hee shall set a wall of separation
betweene both (by a definitiue sentence, or a iudgement
past) for the setling and establishing of his creatures.
            Here you see a commission graunted, and a power
giuen vnto Satan to tempt man, and that in the time
of his innocencie, (for innocencie is best discouered by
the triall of tentation): thus Christ was likewise tempted
in the wildernesse, but Satan had not such an absolute
power as was giuen him ouer Iob 1. 12. Loe, all
that he hath is in thine hand; or as it followes in the
next chapter, verse 6. where his commission is renewed
and enlarged, and power is giuen him ouer the bodie
and person of Iob, Loe hee is in thine hand, but saue his
life. Here rather, we may admire the wonderfull goodnesse
of God, that had set such a separation betweene
man and the diuell, that they could not outwardly conuerse
together,The great separation betweene man and the diuell. as being creatures of a different kinde
and condition: the diuell could not immediatly seduce
his vnderstanding, delude his senses, stirre vp a commotion
in his flesh, for all things were sanctified, herein his
power was limited; he could not vse the ministerie and

helpe of the most noble and best creatures, as being
sunke to the bottome vnder the degree of all creatures.
Thus being destitute of all meanes, which in probabilitie
might well succeede, hauing no right or interest to
enter vpon mans body, or to stirre vp in mans fancie the
least tentation to sinne; yet hee could not forbeare to
tempt, out of his enuie to man, as being heire of that
happinesse, which at first did belong vnto him. Out of
the malice to God, man bearing Gods image, and God
taking a speciall care and charge ouer man; and therefore
no marueile, if he first makes triall of those baser
wormes (as it were), giuing the first onset, the first attempt
vpon nature, making the first breach or entrance
into nature, to see whether by their meanes and procuring,
he might stirre vp and kindle commotion. Thus
as if hee were newly crept out of hell, here lately arriued,
and durst not appeare in sight, but would dissemble
his comming, he makes choice of the Serpent, claimes
neighbourhood, kindred, acquaintance, and familiaritie
(for both are the basest of all creatures, and both together
inhabit the bowels of the earth); here they enter
a league,The Diuel and the Serpent enter a league. that if they could but cunningly seduce man,
and draw him within the compasse of high treason,
make him subiect to death by the breach of Gods law;
then they would begge his goods and his substance,
betweene them, they would share all his estate, the one
should take his body, the other his soule for a bootie.
Thus at length hee perswades the Serpent to be his Agent
and factor, desiring to inuert and ouerthrow the
whole course of nature, when the basest creature shall
giue aduice and direction to the best, in the highest
point of religion; and that the Serpent should deceiue
the woman, the woman her husband, (the feete must
guide and direct the head), notwithstanding Gods
forewarning and threatning to the contrary.
            
               That this spirit should thus talke by the Serpent; doe
you not conceiue how pipes and musicall instruments,
doe yeeld a iust and fit found, being plaied vpon by the
hands of a curious Artsman?That the Serpent should speake. Doe not the wilde forrests
and woods yeeld a proportioned eccho, according to
the last clause of ye sentence? Do not many birds speake
perfectly and distinctly many words very sensible and
significant, being taught by the art and industrie of
man? and shall we ascribe no more to the subtiltie of
Satan, who being a spirit, is apt to penetrate all bodies,
and well knowing the nature and vse of all instruments
and parts, can fitly begin the motion? Now if any thing
seemes strange in respect of our parents, you must consider,
that as things were then newly created, so their
experience could not be great; as their innocencie did
keepe them from attempting euill, so it kept them from
the least suspition of euill: the sin it selfe taking growth
by degrees, first the woman was tempted,The degrees of this first sin. who happily
might be ignorant of Gods commaund, for the precept
was not giuen vnto her. This woman tempteth her husband;
alas what might you ascribe to the loue of a wife?
she was not of his owne choice, but appointed by God
for his helper, and therefore marke his excuse: Gen. 3.
12. The woman which thou gauest me, gaue me the fruit:
he might haue supposed that both proceeded frō God:
whereas all other things were made onely for him, and
giuen onely to him, so that he alone had the full possession
of al, (this one fruite only excepted), his wife now
bringing, and prouoking him to eate of this fruite, hee
might suppose it to bee part of his wiues portion; that
God had inlarged his commission, that now being a
couple, the vse of this fruite was likewise permitted. But
I cannot excuse Adam, for his wife was giuen as his
helper, and therefore the sinne is much greater, that she
should be a meanes to entice him in the breach of Gods

law: though man shall leaue his father and mother, and
cleaue to his wife; yet of any man hate not his wife and
children, yea and his owne life also, and come vnto God,
he shall not be accepted, Luke 14. 26. and he that shall forsake
wife, or children, or lands for his sake, shall receiue
an hundred-fold more, and shall inherit euerlasting life:
Matth. 19. 29.
            Now for the speech of dumbe creatures, let vs search
what testimonies hereof wee shall finde among the
Gentiles. Plato reports in his Politico: Seculo aur

here is the iudgement of an heathen man, concerning
the speech of dumbe beasts,Testimonies of the heathen concerning the speech of dumbe beasts. which certainly hath
some relation to the speech of the Serpent in Paradise;
and hence all the fictions of Poets, the metamorphosis
and change of the creatures tooke their originall. More
especially for the Serpent, let vs heare the testimonie
of an heathen, Pher

with inchantments, and herein seemes to be some
proportion of iustice. Thus reason and the experience
of all ages doe teach vs, that there are certaine ominous
creatures, which (without all superstitious conceit)
though they are not the causes of euill, yet do vndoubtedly
presage and foretell vnfortunate euents: can you
then conceiue how these senselesse and dumbe creatures
should haue such notions and phantasies, as to
giue some outward token; were it not that they are
guided and directed by some diuining and presaging
spirit?
            From the manner of his tentation, I come to the sin,
the tasting of the forbidden fruite. God gaue man the

full possession of Paradise; all other fruites were giuen
for his foode,The greatnes of Adams sin. onely one is excluded, that it might serue
for his soules food, that man might be nourished, and
strengthened, by the keeping of Gods holy lawes and
Commandements. If it seemes strange, that God for so
small an offence, should condemne, not onely the first
man, but the whole stocke and posteritie of man; small
indeede it may seeme in mans eyes: but if you consider
those many blessings which God had imparted to
man, the happinesse wherein hee was created, the large
measure of his knowledge, insomuch that he could not
easily be deluded; the strict commaund of God only excluding
this one fruite, permitting the free vse of the
rest: these things well weighed, will vndoubtedly lay
open the sinne; for the smalnes of the thing, makes the
greatnesse of the offence. If you thinke that God in his
person, or in his attributes, may any way be endamaged,
or suffer eclipse through mans sin, ye deceiue your
selues; for the whole world is but a point, &amp; carries no
sensible quantitie in respect of the heauens: all the mists
that proceede from the earth, cannot any way indarken
the Sunne, but are suddenly dissolued; it lies not in
mans power to obscure Gods glorie, which either will
drop downe in mercie, or breake foorth in iustice: and
therfore the greatest sinne in respect of Gods losse, may
well bee ranckt with the least, and the least with the
greatest; though otherwise not in respect of Gods commaund,
his anger, his punishment.
            But I pray', what sinne could Adam haue committed
at that time, greater then was the tasting of the forbidden
fruite? Couetousnesse or oppression could not assault
him,What sinnes Adam might then haue committed. as hauing the whole world in possession; there
was no place for enuie or wrath, as wanting a competitor;
there were no publike assemblies to be blowne vp
with gun-powder, no Princes to bee murthered, no

factions to bee massacred, no Churches to bee made a
prey for sacriledge, no virgins to bee defloured, no places
of iustice which might be defiled with briberie, no
legall proceedings, wherein periurie and false information
might be admitted; no widow or fatherlesse to be
subiect of wrong and oppression; mans owne knowledge,
the many blessings receiued, together with the
fresh memorie and experience of the 
                  •
               re
                  •
               tion, could
not admit of idolatrie: and yet (according to the condition
of those times) man was not wanting to his own
sinne; as farre foorth as hee could, he tempted and prouoked
God (there being but one precept) in the breach
of that one precept; if more had lien in his power, more
he had attempted in a higher degree: but here was the
mercie of God only to permit the least, for God deales
with man as parents doe with young children, first to
trie with the least, that so the first sinne might not at
first sight be vnpardonable.
            We must here conceiue that according to the condition
of man, who consists of body and soule, so there
was both inward &amp; outward corruption. In the mindes
of our parents there was a great disobedience in the
breach of Gods law; this disobedience proceeded from
a great natural pride, in so much, that as by the inticing,
so according to the example of the bad Angels, they
sinned against God in a very high point of his prerogatiue;
namely his wisedome,

possesse the Throne of God, so man in this one particular
point of his wisedome did aspire to be equall with
God, and therein to vsurpe his prerogatiue: and heere
the necessitie did seeme first to bee imposed vpon the
wisedome of God,The wisdom of God must satisfie, for the 
                     〈◊〉
                   committed against it selfe. that the same wisedome should satisfie
for the offence committed against it selfe; and
therefore Iesus Christ the righteous, who was verbum

in intellectu, sapientia patris, hee must interpose
himselfe as a Mediatour betweene God and man, and
bee the propitiatorie sacrifice for this sinne, hee must
come downe in our flesh, and be like vnto vs, whereas
we attempted to be like vnto him. He must breake the
veile of the Temple and Ceremonies, lay open the secrecies
and mysteries of his kingdome, and yet bee accounted
an vnwise man, that so by the foolishnesse of
preaching, he might correct, or con

and subtiltie of a Serpentine generation.
            Now marke the conformitie of our mindes with our
forefathers, as the similitude of nature, so the similitude
of corruption: The first sinnes of the minde seeme to
be disobedience and pride,Pride is the first sinne of the minde. when we too highly esteem
of our selues, neglecting and contemning all others;
whereunto if you please to adde the naturall curiositie
of our mindes, here is the first step and degree to a second
fall, a fall into all damnable errors and heresies.
And for our bodie, gluttonie seemes to bee the well-spring
of all our carnall and bodily sinnes: as a surfeit
is for the most part the beginning of all our diseases,
the most dangerous of all our diseases, and whereunto
man is most subiect and prone; it doth vndoubtedly
argue that the first sinne was the sinne of a surfeite and
gluttonie,Gluttonie is the first of all carnall sinnes. the tasting of forbidden fruite. Marueile
not, though our Diuines bee strict in preaching their
fasts, &amp; mortifications, for they desire to preuent sin in
the roote: open warre will not easily preuaile against
a State, vnlesse it bee diuided in it selfe with parts-taking,
and factions: if the flesh be pliable and obedient
to the spirit, wee neede not feare any outward assaults
and tentations.
            If still the offence seeme little, then you may well
coniecture Gods wrath and indignation for sin, which
breakes into vengeance for so small an offence: if the

punishment seeme ouer large, in respect of the crime,
thou canst not truly iudge of the foulenesse of sinne,
which is not to be valued according to mans own estimation,
but as it is an high presumption and contempt
of the basest worme against the infinite maiestie of the
diuine power; yet in truth the punishment seemes not
to be so dreadfull and horrid, as the case now stands,
betweene God and man, Thankes be to the mediator of
this couenant betweene God and man (that God and man
Christ Iesus): for now it serues rather as an occasion of
a further blisse and happinesse,The punishment was the occasion of our blisse. then as a punishment for
sinne, Felix culpa quae talem habuit redemptorem. The
miseries of this life they are such, that if they be sanctified
with Gods grace, seasoned with the hope of a better
life to succeede, receiued with patience, acknowledged
with true humblenes of minde; I doubt not but
in them wee shall finde sufficient comfort and consolation;
in so much that wee may now safely triumph ouer
death it selfe, O death where is thy sting! O hell where is
thy victorie! the sting of death is sinne, and the strength
of sinne is the law: but thankes be vnto God, who hath
giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.
            
            So much for the sinne, as it was radically inherent in
Adam: now how the posteritie of Adam should be liable
to the guilt of this sinne, together with the manner
of propagating this sinne, I will speake briefly, and
so conclude. It may bee questioned, whether it might
stand with Gods iustice to condemne all,How it stood with iustice to punish the posteritie of Adam.
                all the whole
kinde, all the whole succession, the vnborne childe for
the sinnes of one? And for answere of this question, I
will extend my speech further, that if God, for no offence
committed, should reprobate and torment all his
creatures, yet could it not be any iniustice in God: for
how shall the vessell say vnto the potter, why madest
thou me thus? This I speake, hauing relation to Gods

infinite and vnlimited power: but as the c
                  •
               se now
stands, assuredly God neuer wrought in his creatures,
according to the rigour and extent of his iustice, for
the creation was a worke of mercie; heere all things
tooke their beginning from mercie; being thus created,
Gods mercie doth ouerflow all his workes. Hence it is,
that mercie sometimes appeares without any taste of
iustice, as in the free distribution of Gods graces; but
iustice is alwaies seasoned with the spice of mercie, in
so much that in the paines of the damned, Gods mercie
still appeares: for hee could by many degrees increase
their tortures and torments, as their sinnes and deserts
doe iustly deserue; and notwithstanding their paine, yet
still they retaine an entitatiue perfection. Now to answere
this doubt, the father is punished, sometimes in
his sonnes, the shame of the one redounding to the reproch
of the other; as you see it practised in our lawes,
where for the fathers offence, the whole stock is attainted:
sometimes the sonnes doe share in the sinnes of
their parents,The measure of Gods iustice. as furtherers and abbe
                  •
               tors in his crime,
being then in his loynes, and part of his substance.
Thus it was with whole mankinde, in respect of Adam,
who was like a politike body, and did sustaine the person
of vs all; and therefore as wee partake of his seede,
partake of his inheritance, so it might well stand with
iustice, that we should partake in his punishment. The
punishment being such, as hath been the occasion of a
farre greater blisse; such (I say) as rather includes a priuation
of that originall grace, which God first imparted
to man, then any great inherent malignitie in our
nature, whereby God intends our destruction; and
therefore seemes to bee some inferiour degree of our
nature, that man descending, hee might ascend to a
higher pitch of his happinesse.
            How this sinne should be conueied to the post
                  •
               ritie

of Adam, I finde it a very difficult controuersie, much
questioned by our Diuines; and the rather, because sin
in it selfe is originally and primarily in the soule,How the sinne is conueied to the postcritie of Adam.
                as being
the fountaine of all our actions, and therefore the
onely subiect capable of sinne. Now the Diuines, together
with the Philosophers agree, that the soule is
immediatly created of God, and therefore being Gods
owne worke, and nothing but Gods, it cannot be tainted
with sinne. Supposing this for a truth, my answere
is, that sinne ought not to be tyed to the seuerall parts,
to the soule, or to the body separatly; but to the parts
ioyntly together (that is) to the whole man, and to the
whole kinde, as wee are the sonnes of Adam; and then
in his loynes actiuely, in committing the sinne, so wee
are sinners; Quid quaeris (saith S. Augustine) latentem
rimam, cum habeas apertissimam ianuam, per vnum hominem
peccatum in hunc mundum intrauit, &amp;c. Why
should we instance in the soule, as it is created of God?
Why should we stand vpon the body, as it consists of
the elements?Sinne is in the whole man, not so properly in the parts. But take this soule when it becomes the
forme of man, take this body when it becomes the vessell
and instrument of this forme, and then both are corrupted:
actions and qualities ought not to be ascribed
to parts, but to the compound, or subiect. Thus whole
man is become sinfull, the guilt remaines in the whole
nature, and the fruites of this sinne appeares in the contrarietie
and opposition of parts; the immoderate desires
of the flesh, the rebellion of the flesh against the
good motions of the spirit, serues for an vndoubted euidence,
to proue the corruption.
            If it might be spoken without offence, I would further
discusse this one question; whether the soule bee
created, or otherwise doth issue foorth from the soules
of our parents, an sit ex traduce? It is a generall receiued
opinion, that the soule is immediatly created of God,

as being a spirit, and therefore admitting no feede; as
being an immortall spirit, and therefore free from generation,
growth, nourishment, or corruption. Saint
Augustine alone considering the descent of this originall
sinne, seemes to doubt of the soules first beginning,
and originall; and therefore shrouding my selfe
vnder his protection, I may safely say, that it is no inconuenience
that there should be a generation among
the soules of men,There may be a generation among spirits. notwithstanding their spirituall condition.
Did not God the Father beget his Sonne from
all eternitie, verbum in intellectu, a word in his owne
vnderstanding? Doth not the holy Spirit proceede
from the Father and the Sonne? and might not the
image of this Trinitie, appeare very liuely in the creation
of man? for Adam, God made his body of the
earth, and for his soule, Deus inspirauit, &amp;c. here was an
immediate creation seuerally of both; for his naturall
temper could not yeeld him a forme, as it did to all other
creatures, producant aquae reptile animae viuentis,
&amp; volatile super terram: and againe, Producat terra
animam viuentem in genere suo, &amp; reptilia, &amp; bestias,
&amp;c. Adam thus created, and cast into a dead sleep, part
of hi
                  •
                flesh, and why not part of his soule might as wel
be taken for the creation of Eue
                     •
                  
                the rather to stirre vp
loue, and conformitie betweene both, that they might
be made one soule and one minde, as they were made
one flesh; here God ceased from his labours, and therefore
wee expect no longer creation. Abel being borne,
partakes of their flesh, and why not partakes of their
soule? for otherwise the sonnes of men, should not bee
so properly sonnes, nor tyed to those naturall duties towards
their parents, as are the dumbe creatures obliged
to theirs. Thus that one spirit should beget another, it
is the highest mysterie of our Christian faith and religion.
            
               And it makes much for the absolute perfection in the
worlds diuersitie, for God is a spirit generating his
Sonne, and creating all creatures: the Angels are spirits,
neither creating,
                  An anima sit ex traduce,
                nor generating; but being once
created, subsist alone, and leaue no posteritie behinde
them, being all created at once, and hauing a state of
continuance in themselues; the soules of men are created,
and being subiect to change and alteration in their
state, may beget other soules, according to the condition
of man, which is to be generatiue in his own kind.
And thus Christ not onely in regard of his flesh, which
he borrowes from the first elements, and hath his matter
common with all the rest of the creatures; but more
especially, and principally in regard of his soule, hee is
the Sonne of man, descended from man; to this soule
the Deitie was first linckt and vnited, and in this soule
the hypostaticall vnion still continued, notwithstanding
his naturall death, and the separation of his soule
from his flesh: this soule did truly, locally and really
descend into hell; and here the prophecie was verified,
Semen mulieris conteret serpentis caput: The Sonne of
man hath conquered hell, and damnation, and lead captiuitie
captiue; which I could wish might most properly
and literally be vnderstood. This soule (as all other
separated soules) had in it selfe a naturall desire
and inclination to returne to the body, which well argues
that they are both twinnes; and in the time of
their separation, the soules are still tyed to their naturall
duties: for Diues (after his death) could remember his
brethren, and yet they were not his brethren, were it
not that they did partake of the soules of their parents;
for otherwise all naturall consanguinitie and affinitie
should cease in a naturall death.
            It seemes very necessarie that the soule should bee
conuaied and diffused, vnacum semine, rather then that

the body being already squared out, and the greatest
part of the workmanship past,How the soule should together worke with the seede. the soule should arriue
(like an vnexpected guest) to this harbour: and it
would greatly disparage man, first to be a plant, then a
beast, then a man; which indeede sauours much of Pythagoras
his transmigration. God hath appointed the
seuerall kindes of creatures, but I cannot conceiue how
there should be such degrees in the kindes; the essence
and forme of a thing cannot be diuided within it selfe,
facultates animae non distinguuntur ab essentia animae. I
cannot possiblie imagine how vegetation and sense
should be in ye embrion, before the accesse of the reasonable
soule; for either they are the faculties of the succeeding
soule (and heere you make a diuision of that,
which indeede is inseparable), or else you must ioyne
those things together, which are of a different nature;
for if euer they were separated, then to compound
them, were to confound them: or lastly, being first separated,
they must still continue diuided, and so in the
vnitie of one person, cause the multiplicitie of subiects.
            As the Starres and the celestiall bodies, though pure,
spirituall, simple, and incorruptible; yet all of them
haue not in themselues their inbred and naturall light,
but doe receiue their light from the Sunne,As in heauenly bodies, so in spirits. which is the
fountaine of light; and this appeares by the eclipses,
the coniunction and opposition of starres, as likewise
by the order of the vniuerse, that all should be reduced
to one, a number to an vnitie. And as it is thus in celestiall
and spirituall bodies and qualities, so why
not in spirituall soules? the reason is the same, and the inconueniences
should bee alike in both: herein consists
a difference betweene things spirituall and things corporeall,
the one imparts it self without his owne losse,
the Sunne sends foorth infinite beames, inlightens the

whole world, yet loseth not part of his light; whereas
bodily substances, the more they ingender, the more
they detract from themselues.
            That generation should necessarily inforce a corruption,
there is no colour of truth.A thing may be generated, and yet not be corrupted. God the Father did
beget his Sonne, and this Sonne is of equall perfection
with the Father: God created all things of nothing,
therefore shall all things returne againe vnto nothing?
This is a false consequence; for being once produced,
the same power shall vphold and continue them, which
laid their first foundation: euery thing containes in it
selfe a power, or rather an impotencie to returne vnto
nothing; and no creature in it selfe is independent, but
seeing it hath stood with Gods mercie first to produce
them, it cannot but stand with the goodnesse and constancie
of his will, still to continue them, and to preserue
his owne most excellent workmanship. So that
now all things relie not on the weaknesse of their own
foundation and pillars, but on the inuincible strength
of Gods power, the most certaine assurance of his promises,
the most infallible effects of his prouidence: so
that howsoeuer the production was, whether by creation,
generation,It sufficeth that the soule was at first created. alteration, &amp;c. yet we shall not neede
to doubt or feare the corruption. And whereas some
will suppose, that creation would make more for the
dignitie of the reasonable soule, let it suffice that at
first she was created, &amp; inspirauit, &amp;c. she had a different
beginning from the flesh or the body, she was not
brought foorth by vertue of any mixture, as the formes
of other creatures were, which being not able to subsist
of themselues, therefore both matter and forme were
created in one lumpe together; so that still creation
may not improperly bee ascribed to the reasonable
soule, in regard of her first birth and natiuitie.
            But the question is for the propagation of soules in

these times, me thinkes I should like an opinion which
would reconcile both, that the soule should both bee
created and likewise traduced. For seeing there is an
action both of God and man, and both alike are ingaged
in the generation of man; man in regard of a naturall
birth generating a sonne according to nature;The authors opinion is, that anima creatur ex traduce.
                and
God concurring not onely as to a creature, but as to
him who might heereafter bee his sonne by adoption
and grace: therefore in respect of Gods action, there is
a creation which includes a beginning, different from
the ordinary course &amp; streame of nature; (for the soule
is beyond the precincts of nature) and likewise excludes
all subiect matter, whereof it might consist; for
the soule is a spirituall substance, which without seede,
and without losse of her parts is propagated by some
extraordinarie power of God. To this creation man
may concurre, for Eue was created, though created of
part of mans body; the Angels may minister in a worke
of Gods infinite power, the soule though created, yet
she may bee created ex trad
                     •
                  ce: and as man concurres
with God in the action, so in respect both of God and
of man there may be two different actions, as in many
things which proceede from our sinnes, yet God hath
his goodnesse therein. Thus both the opinions may
well together subsist,The reasons which moue him. 
               anima creatur ex traduce, in respect
of God; anima generatur ex traduce, in respect of
man, whose condition is generatiue▪ Yet whatsoeuer I
haue herein spoken, I haue onely spoken by way of disputation,
referring my selfe wholly to the iudgement
of the Church; wherein if I haue sinned, or in
any other words which haue past from me vnaduisedly,
I doe here humbly desire God, to forgiue me the sinnes
of this pamphlet. Indeede I must confesse, I doe rather
incline to this opinion, first for the authoritie of
S. Augustine, whom I doe reuerence aboue all others:

secondly, that with stronger chaines I might knit and
vnite the Godhead to our nature in the person of
Christ, than barely to clothe him with our flesh, which
is common to other creatures; when as his soule was
created, himselfe conceiued by the holy Ghost, and only
borne of a Virgin: thirdly, to shew the certaintie of
Gods promises to the elect, and to their seede; and likewise
to manifest the dutie of children to parents, that
they owe vnto them more then their flesh, (for thus if a
man should giue me my foode, and my nourishment, he
might likewise bee said to giue me my flesh); whereas
Scripture affirmes, that a farre greater duty belongs vnto
parents, and therefore it should seeme it is for some
greater respect.
            Lastly, that I might more easily trace out the paths of
this originall sinne; how it is safely conuaied from the
parents to the children, laid vp in the soule as the treasure,
or rather the burthen thereof; and from the soule
how it is deriued together with life, into the flesh, the
bones, and the inward marrow of man; for the seede
partakes as the strength and vertue, so the faults and infirmities
of the whole man.Sinne is like an infectious disease. There are naturall and hereditarie
diseases which seeme to bee intailed to one
stocke; there are many vices proper and peculiar to one
kindred: see you not how diuers nations doe differ
from others, as in their forme and their lineaments, so
likewise in colour and properties? Doth not one man
sicke of the plague infect the whole Citie, and is not
the same infection alwaies aptest to taint the same
blood: then why should it seeme strange, that the first
man corrupted with sinne, should taint his whole seed?
why should wee not suppose the poyson and malignitie
of sinne, to be of as great efficacie, &amp;c?
            Thus (I hope) by the light of our naturall reason the
fall and corruption of man sufficiently appeares; which

I take to be the first principle and ground-worke of all
our Christian faith and religion, as S. Augustine saith in
lib. 1. aduersus Iulianum, cap. 2. Alia sunt, in quibus
inter se aliquando etiam doctissimi, atque optimi regulae
Catholicae defensores,
               The conclusion of this Treatise. 
               salua fidei compage, non consonant,
&amp; alius alio de vna re melius dicit &amp; verius; sed lapsus
hominis, ad ipsa fidei pertinet fundamenta; quisquis in
Christiana fide vult labefactare (quod scriptum est, per
hominem mors, &amp; per hominem resurrectio mortuorum,
&amp; sicut in Adam omnes moriuntur, ita in Christo omnes
vinificabuntur), totum quod in Christum credimus auferre
molitur. Before I can presume to raise man, necessarie
it is that man should first acknowledge his fall;
and seeing his owne fall, should therefore distrust in
himselfe, and in his owne naturall light; and from this
diffidence in himselfe, should desire to be instructed in
those waies which concerne his saluation. Hee that is
sicke, wants a Physitian, and if hee takes his owne ordinarie
nourishment, it will increase his disease: he that
is fallen and wallows in the mire, the more he struggles
and striues, the deeper hee sinkes. Let it suffice, that being
fallen and corrupted in our selues, wee may rouse vp
our spirits, and looking to those few sparkes of reason,
which now lie raked vp in the dead embers of our nature,
wee may againe kindle and inflame them, at the
burning and shining lampe of our faith, setting before
our eyes that day-starre, which springing from an high
hath visited vs, Christ Iesus, our onely deare Lord and
Sauiour Christ Iesus; who is the way, the truth, and the
life, the way to direct vs to the truth, the truth to guide
vs to life, the life to giue vs full contentment of happinesse:
who is the way, the truth, and the life, in whom wee
liue, wee moue, and haue our being, by whom, for whom,
and through whom, we hope and expect our saluation; to
whom with the eternall Father, and the most holy spirit,

three persons and one God, be all honour and glorie, as
before the foundations of the world were laid, so in the
beginning, is now, and euer shall bee world without
end, Amen, Amen.

displaced, words mistaken, peeces of sentences omitted,
which doe much obscure the sense. As for example, pag.
69. lin. 6. these words are omitted, viz. For if the horse
knew his owne strength? then followes, but God deales
herein with other creatures, &amp;c. and many such like. I
was very sorrie, to see that, which was so meane in it selfe,
should be made worse: but presently I called to mind, that
the subiect of my booke, was onely to proue a generall corruption;
which corruption I should in effect seeme to disproue
and denie, vnlesse it might euery where appeare, and
therefore a necessitie did seeme so to ordaine it, that it
should first begin in the author, then in the pen, then in
the presse, and now I feare nothing so much as the euill
and corrupt exposition of the Reader, for thus there is a
generall corruption. How happie was I to make choice of
such a subiect, which seemes to excuse all the errors of my
Pamphlet? especially (good Reader) if I shall finde thy
louing and kinde acceptance, well hoping that all others
will be charitable to me, as I am most
charitable to al others, and so I commit
thee to the God of
charitie.
