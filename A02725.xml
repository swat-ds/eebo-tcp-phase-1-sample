            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            An Aduertisement to the
READER.
            
               HAuing receiued this Letter following
out of Barbary, from an honest English
Merchant, who hath long time soiourned
there, very religious, wise
and discreet, and so knowne among
the Merchants: with whom also my selfe conuersed
many moneths, during my abode in that countrie;
and therafter shewing it as a matter of newes
to some friends, I was at length importuned to make
it common, in respect of the nouelty: est natura
hominis nouitatis auida; and (as the Prouerbe
is) Africa semper aliquid apportat noui. Thereby
to satisfie, if not all (which) was wont to bee the
Poets taske: Populo vt placerent quas fecisset fabulas);
yet at least wise those, who haue nought else
to doe,Act. 17. 21 (like those Athenians in the Acts) but either
to tel or heare some newes: Howbeit, I hope,
it may serue to some good vse also for vs Christians
of these last daies,Forty yeers (saith this new saintish king or Prophet of his) &amp; then Christ must come to iudgement as in the letter. 
               vpon whom the ends of the
world are come: to see how busily the Diuell acteth
his last part, now in this last age of the world, &amp;
playeth his prize, for that he knoweth he hath but a
short time, 40. yeers by his own calculation, pronouncing
before hand his owne condemnation. For the
Lord hath so done his marueilous workes that
they ought to be had in remembrance: And so

ought the deuils workes too, though in an other
kind, &amp; a Latere (as I may say) for he is the Ape &amp;
imitator of God (transforming himselfe into an
Angel of light) neither can he doe any thing of
himselfe, but by Gods permission as he hath power,
commission and authority from him. And therein
also many times he plaieth the Mountibank, obtruding
for true and effectual workings (as the Apostle
tearmeth them) many false and feigned delusions.
And whether true or false, his end is still
to deceiue, and vent his lying arts, doctrines of
deuils; and therefore in scripture worthily stiled
the father of lies: and his miracles, which hee
worketh for confirmation thereof, lying wonders.
And by these his sleighty conueiances, sometimes
winding heere, sometimes there, hath this subtle
serpent gon about frō time to time, compassing the
earth, to and fro, and walking in it to deceiue the
world. And not onely the world (I meane the children
of disobedience and misbeleefe) but if it
were possible euen the very elect.
               Mat. 24. 24 And such
must bee (or rather is) the comming of Antichrist
in this last age of the world whereof we haue beene
so long since forewarned: (little children it is the
last time &amp;c.)Ioh. 2. 18. 
               Whose comming (as the Apostle
describeth it) is by the effectuall working of Sathan
with all power and signes and lying wonders
&amp;c.
               1. Thess. 2. 9 
               And therefore God shall send them
strong delusions that they should beleeue lies:
that all they might bee damned which beleeue
not the truth &amp;c. O the miserable estate of al misbeleeuers,

whom the diuel hath thus blinded to their
vtter condemnation, which sleepeth not. And
such is the state and condition of these miserable
Moores giuen ouer, beyond measure, to these idle &amp;
superstitious vanities (so Dauid calleth them) I
hate all them that hold of superstitious vanities)
blind prophesies dreams, naecromancie and such
like, wherein these Saints professe themselues, and
hold the people in such awe for feare of their curses
(which many times fall out accordingly: (the diuell
working together) as if they were Popes, such is
their soueraignety. As by this example yee may
see, one of these fanaticall Saints now become a
King. Scilicet his Babylon dextris: euen by these
and such like arts, did that spirituall Babylon, at
the first that great Whore spoken of in the Reuelation,

               the sonne:of perdition,
now sitting as God in the Temple of God,
and shewing himselfe that he is God) vnder the
like pretence come to the height of his supremacie,
and not onely making himselfe a King, but insulting
euen ouer Kings and Emperors: not caring (as the
Prouerb is) neither for King nor Keiser, but exalting
himselfe against God, and all that is called
God: that is to say Kings and Princes. Be wise now
therfore ye Kings, whether Christian or Heathen,
the vse is generall to all, beware of these Saints for
all their hypocriticall shewe of Holinesse. Saints
in profession but Diuels in practise. His Holinesse
catexochen; euen that holy one of Rome,
(for so the word Saint signifieth: a Holy one)

               nam si hic mali est quidquam (I say no more)
they are capital enemies to the thrones of Kings. Instance
this Saint who (forsooth) vnder a colour of
Holinesse, and simplicity, armed with most strong
delusions, euen from the Deuill himselfe; yee see
what wonders he hath wrought against Mully Sidan,
yea and what greater hee promiseth: operae
pretium est audire.
            
            But when that bridge appeareth in the mouth of
the Straights, as he prophesieth, and he with all his
troupes ariue in the Popes Dominions (the Pope
and he in the Lists together) then we shal see whether
deuil is the stronger. The Lord preserue his people
from their deuillish delusions. And so after this
long Preface (too long I must needs confesse for so
short a discourse, but that I could not wel cut it
shorter) I referre it to the censure of the wise to
make vse of: beeing the chiefe and maine motiue,
with the aduise and approbation of some godly Persons,
Preachers and others, why I haue published it.
Which (if I finde acceptable) I may (perhaps) bee encouraged
to reuise some papers of my owne, all this
while throwne aside, as touching the affaires and
state of that country, falling within the compasse of
my daily obseruation, during that my imployment:
with other accounts of my time not altogether idlie
spent there, hauing now but too good a leasure (since
the losse of so hopefull a Maister) for such a purpose,
God send vs an other comforter. And so once
more farewel gentle Reader.

                     GOod Sir, in most hearty
manner I commend mee
vnto you, with desire of
your good health and all
other content to your
hearts desire, vvhich the
Lord graunt vnto you Amen.
                  Since my last vnto you, here is great alteration
in this gouernment, as I account
you haue vnderstood before now▪ And because
Master N. and Master F. haue beene
here, and heard, and seene what hath passed,
I do referre the discourse to conference:
For I assure my selfe they will visite
you. Yet I will make bolde to trouble you,

to aduise of some perticulers as followeth.
The tenth day of May was the battaile
betwene Mulley Sidan, and our new King
Mulley Om Hamet ben Abdela; not farre
from Marocus betwixt the mountaines, and
the City, both sides very strong: Yet in
mans iudgement Mulley Sidan of most
force in horse and foote, and three and
thirty peeces of good field ordnance.
The other no ordnance, and a few peecemen:
his chiefest force Larbies of Sahara,
a place distant hence twenty daies iourney.
                  These armed with Launces, demy Launces
and Azagies,Larbies are the country people dwelling in tents. Brebers those that inhabite the mountaines A
                           •
                        agies are a kind of darts. and many Larbies that
came in to him, by the way as he came, some
hee forced, some voluntary. And at the
day of battaile his people beganne to
bee dismaied, perceiuing Mulley Sidan,
was very strong. But hee encouraged
them, saying, as they had found that come
to passe which formerly hee told them,
so now they should see the like, and bid
them not feare his ordnance, for onely
three peeces should goe off, and doe
no harme: the rest should take fire, but
not shoote a bullet, and hee would bee
formost, and goe in the face of the ordnance,
and finding his wordes true,

then at his commaund to fall vppon his enemies
                  So hauing satisfied his people with these
perswasions sent spies to know where Mulley
Sydans ordnance lay, and so came
right before it, with all his troopes. And
comming within daunger, at Mulley Sidans
commaund, they gaue fire, hauing
both Moores and Christians that knew
how to mannage his ordnance.
                  So three peeces went off, and did no
hurt. But the bullets hard sing in the ayre
a great height, and the rest of the ordnance
tooke fire, and burnt out the powder,
but shot no bullet that remained in,
so comming nearer, the Musketiers plaied
vpon them, with foure thousand shot, yet
hurt no man.
                  So then they came on, and Mulley Sidans
people gaue way and fled. They
pursued them, and slue Mulley Abdela ben
Hammet, Alkaide Hammet, Benzebe
                           •
                        re,
and many moe Alkaides, and betweene
foure and fiue thousand people. So put
his people into Marocus, and lay himselfe
in the field.
                  Hee hath not entered into Marocus,
neither purposeth till he haue destroied his
enemies, and put peace in his country. So

                     Mulley Sidan fled &amp; came down to Saphia,Hackam is a chiefe officer in a Citty.
with his Hackam, Abdela Kather, Abdela
Sadocke and the Iew Benwash, and a few others
(besides his mother and women,
and luggedge) hee made account to
gather a head againe, and to giue a new
battaile. But in vaine the Larbies made a
faire shew and came in to him, and receiued
some mony, cloth, and linnens
from him, and so would haue betrayed
him.
                  Whereupon he hauing some of his brother
Mulley Shecks children with him, (to
make frendship with his brother) sent him
his children, and wrote to him very kindly,
So betwene them I accountis peace.
So staied heere so long as he durst: for
that Mulley Om Hammet persued him.
Whereby hee was forced to fraight a ship
of Marcelleis heere in port, with a French
Ambassador, who came to him vpon bussines
out of France, and a Fleming that
was in the roade: and tooke his Treasure
and luggage, some Women and
Children, some Al
                           •
                        aids and Seruants,
and Benwash and his followers, and went
for Santa Cruz and there Landed in Sus:
and from thence to Tarradante, and there
since remained, what force he hath or of his

proceeding wee here know not the certaintie.
                  Some fewe dayes after his departure,
came our new King into these parts, halfe
a dayes iourney from Saphia, and all the
Larbies came in to him &amp; submitted themselues,
and he receiueth all into fauor, pardoning
what passed: For hee sayth, hee
comes to make peace, and is sent from
God, because of the euill gouernment of
Mulley Hammets sonnes the Xeriffes;Kinred of Mahomet which they challenge. and
to stablish their Prophets religion, that was
decaied, and to fight against the Christians,
and recouer those parts of Christendome
the king of Spaine holds from them:
as Granada, Andaluzia, &amp;c▪ and tels his
people they shall yet see great wonders
come to passe, where they shall acknowledge
he is sent of God; he promiseth them
Spaine, Italy, and France: and hauing put
peace in these countries, there must now
appeare a Bridge in the mouth of the
straights, which hath been in former time,
(and so recorded in their writings) and sunk
in the sea. Now in his time it must appeare
to carrie ouer the Moores: and hauing
gayned these countries; he must raigne forty
yeeres, and then must com Christ, whom
they call Sidie Nicer: and he must surrender

all to him; for he must iudge the world
and then all must end.
                  But for England, Flanders, or other
parts they haue not to doe, they will haue
friendship with vs, and desire trade and
traffique with vs in loue and friendship, and
would haue his myracles and acts made
knowne abroade the world: I was in his
Almahalla at first fowre dayes,Or Camp. and spake
with him, and saw his behauiour, and found
him very humble and courteous, with many
good speeches; and pittying the iniuries
all the Christians haue by the ill gouernment

And now diuers libel in Larby verse against

and of further misery must come vnto him,
till he and his race be consumed. And for

coms to put peace amongst them; neither to
rob thē, nor yet to lose his right; not to giue
them pay, but force them to serue him, as
need requireth, if they yeelded not to such
conditions, his sword should force them:
he came amongst them as a guest, and was
to be entertained by them, and not to giue
them to gaine their fauour. By which speeches,
myracles past, and policy, hee hath
made them all tremble; so he puts all to silence:
Som cōtent themselues, of the greatest
in former time, to heare and see, shew obedience
and say nothing: others change
with the time, and haue great imploiments,
and professe loialty to him, and renounce
their old Master; what the euent may be I
know not: for, we haue learned, the hearts
of Kings are in the hands of the Lord, he turneth
them as riuers of waters which way hee
pleaseth.
                  
                  
                     
But hauing beene in his Almahalla, seeing
the manner of it, his plainnesse and policy,
mixt with a shew of mercy and a kind
of Saintish gouernment, I feare mee it will
come to passe, according to the Fable in
Aesop, when th
                        •
                      Frogs desired a King, a
blocke was throwne downe into the water,
which dash at the first made them feare
him, but lying still they grew familiar, and
sunned themselues vpon him, and grew in
dislike; so had the Storke: But it were to
be wished they would now content themselues,
when peace and iustice is offered.
If he doe continue it is like to be with trouble
and bloud-shed; for already the people
begin to disobey, and the Shabenites, Mulley
SidansOr Kinred. 
                     Cast, are got to the Mountaines
neare Marocus, and haue procured some
of thoseMountainers. Brebers (as wee tearme them) to
ioine with them; and one Mulley Om Hammet
Bolassom, and these haue robbed to the
gate of Marocus; wherupon this King sent
forces to expell them, but found them so
strong that they durst not meddle with
them: whereupon was forced to rehale his
Almahalla some fifteen dayes since, and is
gone towards the Mountaines, where at
this present hee is neere frugo: and what
hath passed since we know not, only expect

euery howre to heare some good newes that
he may preuaile; but here it is greatly feared,
because many of his owne people be departed
from him: and those Larbies he caried along
with him out of these parts, run away
and returned, so if he lose, the other bee the
friends of Mulley Sidan, and he is expected againe:
But the beginning and rising of this
king and his procedings are very strange. He
is a great saint and learned in the lawe, and
was sought vnto by many the principallest of
the land for his blessings, and fauour, according
to their superstition; he findes it in ancient
books writ of him by way of prophecy,
that such a man of that place named Messa
(whence he is) by name Mulley Om Hamet be
                           •
                        
Abdela, should bee sent at this time, to put
peace in the country, and to reuiue their law,
and put out the race of Mulley Sidan, and
name of Xeriffes: and so to raigne forty yeers
till Christ come to iudgement: his beginning
must be, hee must strike vp a drum hee
should finde in that Zow

                        〈◊〉
                      Missa, and then
should repaire vnto him people, to make him
king. The manner of his proceedings, and
what encounters hee should haue, and what
he found written, all the Talbies and learned
men now do confesse to find the same written
in their bookes. At his beginning he put
forth only one tent and a kitchen: so resorted

to him the Shrokies, a saintish people in
their lawe, but otherwise in behauiour very
Sauages. These without pay came to him, to
the number of 150. or 200. at most; and with
their helpe hee brake Alhadge▪ Lemiere, and
his forces, seruants of Mulley Sidan, beeing
5000. strong; so more of the sayd Shrokies
came to him, to the number of 5000. &amp; with
them and such people as ioined with him in
the way, he ouerthrew Mulley Sidans forces
thrise before the battell.
                  And so came to some strong places in the
Mountaines, neuer brought to subiection in
the time of Mulley Sidan, nor his father:
Those with-stood him, but hee ouercame
them and made them pay him what he demanded,
serue and obey him; so forced the
principallest Shecks in the countrie to come
to him. After this marched towards Morocus,
and by the way was to pass a riuer; and
the daie before he warned his people, in passing
such a riuer no man to take vp water in
their hands to drinke, if he did he would die.
After comming to the riuer weary and hot,
many not remembred, or not regarded his
words, but tooke vp water in their hands,
drunk, and anon after dyed, the rest all escaped,
which strooke a feare into them to
breake his command, and a perswasion that
hee is more then a man: For they say hee

is their Fatamie, that is, a Sauiour. Next in
comming to Morocus, diuers great Saints
and Sheckes resorted together, and would
goe to visite him, that they might see what
hee was, and vnderstand whether that
which passed was true or not. So comming,
after salutations, hee told them they
came to enquire and see what newes, and
what wonders hee did, and so meant to depart.
                  Now therefore, being men of account
and Talbies hee would satisfie them, that
they might satisfie others. So appointed
them a time to come againe, and to bring
such bookes, hee nominated, with them;
so they did: Then he willed them to turne
to such places, and reade what they found
written of him; so they did. To wit, both
his name, his beginning, and course he was
to take, and withall found written seauen
speciall markes, or signes, hee must
haue vppon his bodie, a wart aboue his
right eie, a blacke tooth before, a bunch
of hayre growing betweene his shoulders,
a signe of a ring in the palme of his right
hand, the signe of a spurre vpon the outside
of his right legge; the rest I remember
not.
                  But these and the rest hee shewed them
which seeing they did honor him and swore

to him to serue him, and to liue and die with
him, or in his cause.
                  Next comming to a place named Dets in
the mountains very strong, where much people
were gathered together against him so
that some of his owne people began to faint
and be afraied: hee bad them feare nothing
for that before to morrow they should see
there was more with him then against him:
so that night, he cōmanded to take vp his Almahalla
&amp; march towards that place Dets:
so they did, and all night long to the thinking
of al his people, there marched another
Almahalla greater then theirs, and went before
them: and comming to the place Dets
vannished away, and at sight of it his enemies
fled, leaft the place and goods, al to the
spoile, so comming thither had the spoile of
all without fighting. This our country man
M. W. affermeth with diuers others vpon
solemne oth to haue seene. At his being in
these parts, my selfe with others went to welcome
him: he entertained vs very kindly, &amp;
told vs he would shew the English what fauour
he could, and permit them free trade,
willing vs to take knowledge that he was sent
by Gods appointment to releeue the oppressed
as wel Moores and strangers, as Christians,
and al sorts, and what we had seene and
heard to aduertise, saying wee should see yet

more strange matters come to passe, then
what had passed. His meaning as we gather
is, the conquering of Spaine, France and Italy;
with which oppinion hee possesseth the
foolish and credulous Moores. Now hauing
bin tedious to trouble you with such news as
the time affoords (not al but part as it comes
into my memory) I pray you take it in good
part: the censure hereof I leaue to your wisdome
and confideration. For my owne
part I am perswaded, they bee delusions of
the diuell done by witch-craft, &amp; permitted
by the Lord, to seduce them to further error,
God deliuer vs Christians well from among
them, and grant vs the vse, and true knowledge
of his holy word preached in Christian
countries which heere wee want, and the
vse and comfort of his holy Sacraments to
the sealing vp of our faith in Christ Iesus
Amen.
                  
                  I am sorry I haue nothing for remembrance,
to present vnto you, but God willing
when the time betters I will not bee forgetfull:
in the meane time, I pray you accept of
these few lines in good part. So resting euer
at your seruice, I commit you to Gods holy
tuition who blesse you in this world with
health and content, and in the world to
come with eternall ioy, Amen.

                  Another letter receiued from
another friend, at the same time dated
the tenth of September.
                  GOod Sir pardon me in that at my going
away, I came not to take my leaue of
you▪ the ship went downe two daies sooner
than I made account off. But for all your
courtesies alwaies towards mee, I heartily
thanke you and remaine your debter &amp;c.
For the state of this country, and of the wars
of this new King, I know Master S. hath enlarged
you more than I can a great deale. But
for all this, and the troubles Mulley Sidan
hath had, it is thought he will be king again,
and that in short time: staying but for a new
Moone to giue battaile. This Saint or king
told his Shrokies which came with him at
first, his comming was to take Mazagant,
Sute and Tanger, not to sight against the
Moores vnlesse they would resist, and not let
him take the Christian townes. Hee said againe
that Mulley Sidan and his followers
were Christians, one who robbed all men
without reason, killed and slue many men
vpon no occasions, but in his angry minde.
And withall said hee dranke wine, and eate
oppium, therefore said it could not bee but

that hee was an Vn
                           •
                        rony, which amongst
them they hold to bee an vniust, or vngodly
man as they say wee Christians are. His
Shrokies two thousand fiue hundreth almost
all footmen, with no peeces, but halfe
Launces: that was their weapons, bareheaded
men. Neuer in their liues they weare
shert, or cloth to their backes, but an Alheik.
Which Shrokies haue left this king, and are
all gonne for their country. This kings forces
are of Larbies, which are horsemen: euery
day they flee from him more and more.
As Alkaid Syde, whom you know Alkaid of
this place, is come from him with sixe hundreth
horse. So that very shortly Mulley Sidan
is expected to come heare againe. And
thus with my commendations to your good
selfe, and all our good friends I commit you
to the Almighty.
                  
                     Yours assured to command,
G. B.
                     
                  
               
            
            
            SInce the writing (and almost printing) of
these two letters, there is nevves come
(and that for certaine as I am giuen to vnderstand)
that Mulley Sidan is defeated againe,
and hath lost this last battaile: so the
Saint victorious still. What the euent of all
these troubles may bee it is hard to gesse.
This country hauing beene so long time (euer
since the death of olde Mulley Hamet) so
vnsetled, and subiect to so manifold alterations:
so many yeeres, almost, so many alterations
or gouernment: The crowne imperiall
tossed to and fro, from one to another,
as it were a tennis ball rather then a diadem.
