            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

1596.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            To M. E. S. Esquier.
            
               SIr, my maister hauing expresly
commaunded mee, to finish a
straunge discourse that he had
written to you, called the Metamorpho-sis
of AIAX, by
setting certaine pictures thereto;
there came vnto my minde a tale I had heard,
perhaps more merry then mannerly. How a plain,
or rather a pleasant Seruingman, wayting on his
maister at the Popes Court, happened to be present
one day, when the Gentleman, after long attendance
and great meanes, had obtained the fauour
to kisse his holinesse foote. The man seeing
what his maister did, first stale out of the chāber,
&amp; then ranne out of the house, hiding himselfe for
a pretie space. The Gentleman hearing of it, pittied
his mans simplicity (who perhaps was crafty
knaue inough for all that) and asked why he went
away? Alas sir said he, when I saw that a man
of your worth and worship, in so publique a place,
might kisse but his toe, I doubted they would haue
made me, haue kist him in some homelyer place,
and so I might haue bene shamed for euer.
            If that seruingman had cause to runne out of
the house, my thinke I may seeme to haue more
reason, to runne out of my wits, to haue so strange
a taske appointed me; for when the verie face, &amp;
head, or title of the booke, seemed so fowle &amp; vnsauerie,

vvhat might I thinke the feete or tayle
thereof vvere like to proue? Wherefore I would
gladly haue shunned so base an office: but hauing
my maisters exāple ioyned to his commandement,
I tooke hart to me, and first I read ouer the discourse,
to see what was promist therein on my behalfe
(viz. certaine pictures.) But I assure you in
the reading of it, whether it were the wel hādling
of the matter, or my partiall opinion (a fault that
I am seldome charged withall) my minde was altered,
and I compared the homely title of it, vnto
an ilfauored vizer,Or to a road or a snake made in suger, that lookes vnsightly, but tasts sweetly. such as I haue seene in stage-playes,
whē they daunce Machachinas, which couers
as sweet a face sometimes as any is in the cō
               panie.
And euen presently therewithall, as if I had
bene inspired vvith the spirite of AIAX, me
thought I durst haue aduentured with my pen
and pensill vpon any thing. For, as the saying is,

                  Painters and Poets, clayme by old enrolment,
                  A charter, to dare all, without controlment.
               
            
            Wherefore by the Priuiledge of this Charter
(as also by a Pattent I haue of seruing two prentiships)
I vvill go somevvhat beyond the bare
wordes of my cōmission, and yet not swarue much
from the charge that is layd vpon me. For Sir, I
vvould you knew it, though I neuer troubled the
schooles at Oxford, with any disputes or degrees,
yet I carried there a good schollers bookes after
him, and I trust I gat some quaynt phrases amōg
them, as namely in steed of praying the Cobler to

set two patches on my shoes, I could haue said, set
me two semicircles vpon my suppeditals,
vvith much other eloquence beyond the common
intelligence. And yet notwithstanding all these
great vaunts, I wil not take vpō me, that I am able
to say so much of the Metamorpho-sis, the
Etimologie, &amp; the reformation of Don AIAX-house,
as my maister hath said, or to defend the
vvordes, illustrate the matter, and dilate of the
forme as he hath done, for vvho can stand against
such an army of Emperours, Kings, Magistrats,
Prophets, Poets, All-hallowes, and all prophanes,
euen from the Bible to the bable, as are by him
brought for enobling of his arguments? Yet for
Anatomysing as it vvere of the shape and bodie
thereof,M. Plat in his booke against famine, fol. vltimo penultimo.
                because he hath handled that point (in
M. Plats opinion) somewhat too briefly for common
vnderstandings, I must heare a litle better
open it: for as the old saying is, (bonum quo cō
                  munius
eo melius) and the old verse is,

                  
                     Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter.If that which followes offēd the reader, he may turne ouer a leafe or two, or but smell to his sweet gloues, and then the sauor will neuer offend him.
                     
                  
                  
                     Goodnesse is best, when it is common showne,
                     Knowledge were vayne, if knowledge were not knowne.
                  
               
            
            Wherefore now, seriously and in good sadnesse
to instruct you, &amp; all Gentlemen of worship, how
to reforme all vnsauerie places of your houses,
vvhether they be caused by priuies, or sinkes, or
such like (for the annoyance comming all of like
causes, the remedies neede not be much vnlike,)
this you shall do.

either in the roome, or aboue it, from vvhence

But a great many of my Maisters betters,
may say for themselues:

            And against the worthy Anthonie (whom
so noble pennes haue celebrated) marke what
he saith, &amp; where? euen in the Senat: But first,
you must imagine that Anthonie had had a
litle mischaunce, while he sate in Iudgement
on the Bench (perhaps some foolish Orator,
that could not tell a slouenly tale cleanly had

bin arguing, of purgare and reficere cloacam.)
Whereby the noble man being queysie, layd
open his stomacke, and Tullie, owing him a
grudge, a yeare after layes it in his dish, in
these sweet wordes.

            Thus you see you M. T. C. when it
pleased him, to displease others, would vse
wordes as bad as the best of vs.
            But to argue succinctly (as they call it) I say,
that that some call scurrilitie, in this booke▪ is
indeed but a checke to scurrilitie. I wil proue
it.Grāmariās. Musitians. Daunsers. Fensers. Teachers of all sortes, when they wil teach
one to mend his fault, will shewe the fault in
themselues first. Also the incomparable Poet
of our age, to giue a most artificiall reproofe
of following the letter too much, cōmits the
same fault of purpose.

            Further this booke,A good triall of what spirit a booke is written. where it seemes most
loose, marke if it do not stoppe rather then
open all gaps of lasciuiousnesse.
            But least some bad disputers, cōfessing the
premisses to be true,This is to you that be Schollers. should denie the cōclusion,
let me deale Sillogisticè in moode and figure.
And that the Sillogisme may be sutable

to the proposition,A Sillogisme in Bocardo. let it be in the third figure
the fift moode called Bocardo.
            
            Some homely words in necessary matters
are not to be condemned.Maior.

               Conclusion. the title of the booke should not be
condēned Now if any be in so fierse a figure,
and in so angrie a moode, that he will reduce
all to Barbara, I thinke we should chop logicke
best with such a one in ferio.
            
            But if an argument be brought against vs
in the second figure,A Sillogisme in the first moode of the second figure. in a sober moode, and in
the sacred name of Cesare; in this wise:
            No wordes obscenous, scurrill, and sordidous,1
should come to modest, chast, and vertuous
eares;
            But all words cōcerning the subiect of the
booke,2 are obscenous, scurrill, and sordidous:
            
               Ergo, no part of the booke is approuable.3
Faith, then we are all non plus. I would our festino,

nor replying to that moode, but onely
say, God saue the Queene, and pray for the
Psalme of mercy.

my selfe a litle with you and your friends, let
me tell you some of my aduētures. A seruāts

then how many wayes I can liken me to him,

where we saw young children mothers at xi,

            Since this trauell we haue bene both Poeticall,6
and I Musicall &amp; Pictorical, &amp; though
we may lye and steale by authoritie, yet we
are taken for true men, and haue holpe to

            At this houre some of our friends,7 thinke
vs worthy of better fortunes thē we haue, but

none is our friēd so much to helpe vs to thē.
            We haue playd, and bene playd with,8 for
our writings. Si quis quod fecit, patiatur ius erit
equū. If you doe take but such as you giue,
it is one for another, but if they that play so,
would giue vs but a peece of gold for euerie

            But now, that you may know I haue bene
a dealer in Emblemes, I will conclude with a
deuise not sharpe in conceyte,It is good to set a name to the booke: For a booke without name may be called a libell. but of venerable
