            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL MY TENDER KINSMAN AND DEARE BROTHER IN CHRIST, VVILLIAM STRACHIN,
                OF TIPPERTIE, GRACE and peace in our Lord Iesus Christ.
            
               RIGHT Worshipfull and dearely beloved both in the flesh &amp; in the Lord, when, not long agoe, your love led you to come and visit me, I was, vpon the occasion even then offered, a penning of this little piece: whereof you craving earnestly, at that time, a copy, and having, therewith told me how you had left my tender kinsman and your owne faithfull friend Maister Thomas Michel Minister of the Gospel of Christ, lying sick of an ague: I covenanted with you, that, with the first, who from you should bring me assurance of his cōvalescing, you shuld in recompence of so good tidings, report a copy heereof. Which accordingly, God to him, you to me, and I to you performed. And whereof you had then a hastelie catched copy, I now send you the principall: and, so, I doe send it, as dedicated to your name that whither soever it shall happen to come, yea if possibly it may befal any so farre to fansie it, as, by print, to publish it to the world, yet it may alwayes cary with it this frontepiece, for a monument of our mutuall affection, &amp; that singular regard I have you in: not onely for our conjunction in blood, and these many courtesies and kindly offices

wherof you wearie not to hold me still more and more your debtor: but, much more, for these rare christiā vertues, which, in you, are so much the more cōmendable, as, vailed vnder sweet and christiā modestie, and, in singlenes eying God, and carefully attending on a good cōscience, they never were curious, either to be knowen of men, or to currie the applause of the world. Albeit I very well know, that your sincere heart towards God, &amp; constant care of walking christianly with all men, have bred you both the losse of great carnal, and yet but carnal friends, and also, many apparant worldly disadvantages. In all which losse, your incōparable commoditie is both huge, in the purchase of that one thing which only is to be sought for, and also, passing praise worthy: in that neither any break of duetie to the one, neither anie errour of iudgement, or defect of prudent and diligent endeavour, in the other, but a free choise of mind, to forgoe willingly, what you could have easilie either holden or acquired, if you would, but therefore would not for that, in conscience, you ought not, hath made you to count light of such thinges, as the men of this world, madly running after, doe lose both them selves and all these things also: and yet heerein the Lord hath dealt so indulgently with you, as you cannot, but, to the praise of his goodnes and truth, acknowledge the verity of his promise, in a hundreth fold gain, euen in this lyfe. When the other yeare, I was dwelling by you, and, so, was delighted with that sweet conversation and happy fellowshippe, which I can never record but both with regret and ioy, you remēber, that, one day, Maister Thomas Michel brought Iohn Fraser his chalenge to the Ministers of Scotland: which, albeit some yeares ere then, it had bene abroad in our countrie, yet I had never seen

nor heard of, before that time: And, after I had read it, he told me how grealty our countrie-Papists did glorie thereof: And, that so much the more as it had receaved no answer: they imputing that to the strength of their owne, and imbecillitie of our cause: he willed me to cō
               sider if it were not expedient to say something thereto, I answered him then, that they had not great matter of insulting, for any stuffe which was in that treatise: wherto to make any answer it were but to maintain an endles iangling with men who would never be ashamed to repone vnto vs one and the same, a hundreth times, recocted crambe. that nothing was in him which our mē had not often answered: besides, that, whatsoever might have bene done at the first outcōming thereof, yet now when it was stale, and the author departed this life, any particular answer should appeare vorimous. But, as for the matter specially disputed by him, I was about to publish my commentarie vpon the Revelation: whereby I hoped all equitable and judicious Readers should find themselves satisfied of all such doubtes, as by his sophistical discourse might arise even to the most simple readers therof: loving much rather thus to maintain truth, then by contention of disputation. which manner the Church of God hath not, neither mind I for any Thrasonik braggs of our adversaries to alter this resolution: though even a litle before your last visitation of me, som copies of a new treatise of theirs (inscribed a litle treatise of the Protestants profane calling, wherein is proved how they have no true Pastours, and consequently no true Church at all) sparsed here in this part of the countrie (the chiefe stage of their peirt pride) with insolent &amp; high boasting, have thus farre in holy indignation caried me, as, in defence of our callings to pen these few pages. not, particularly

to meet that their treatise, but generally, to refell both it, &amp; whatsoever thing els of any apparant weight (in that argument) alledged by any other. I flee particular cōtesting loving to cleare points but not to plead with persons: and liking to edifie all, but loathing to scold with any. Albeit, so, I might more clearly discover the childish and ridiculous ignorāce of whosoever is the author of that litle treatise, and expone him more delightful to the Readers derision. but neither desire I so to dally: &amp; I know that a Brother, before me hath vndertaken the taske to tread him &amp; overturne him in his owne traces. This, truly, I must say, that, though in neither of the two either the first challenge or this late little treatise, there be any such thing, as may trouble the resolution of any meanly stayed mind: yet the last, for any apparant shew of skill, commeth as far short of the other, as he is, otherwayes, equall with him in high boasting and presumptuous promising of wonders, but performing nothing at all. Receave then my dear brother, this little piece of my paines, wherein, and in ought that is mine, you may iustly claime a special interest, and receave it for a token of vpright love, as I maintain a iust cause: and howbeit that either for qualitie or quantitie it bee farre vnequall to the certain truth and great worthines of the matter: Yet, shal it, I hope, affoord you an answere heereafter to any who disdainfully insulting would aske, what say you Maisters for your callings: and to bee as good as your word once given, that, vpon covenant the demanders would read it, You should find an answer to that wherein they think vs put to non plus. The grace of our Lord IESVS CHRIST be with you.
            
               Your kinsman and loving Brother in Christ P. Forbes of Coirse.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A DEFENCE OF THE LAWFVL CALLING OF THE MINISTERS OF REFORMED Churches, against the cavillations of Romanists.
            
            
               TO any not well acquainted with the condition of the Church in our quarters, and the peert &amp; perverse diligence of Romanistes against it (through their many and strong favourers, &amp; in great scarcitie of able Ministers, the lōg weak resistāce made them) this piece of paines, how small soeuer, yet may perhaps appeare superfluous: in such store of both learned &amp; large treatises already writtē, by our men, in defēce of the truth, &amp; for overthrow of all that error can alledge against it: so, as, in adding any more a man may seeme, but vainlie, to hale the coard of contention with thē who are already 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Which maner the Church of God hath not. And as for these simple blindfolded ones, whom they lead away captive in error, this sort of labour availeth not, in that, howsoever they are readie, fide implicita, to applaude whatsoever Pamphlet put abroad by any of their men, and, insolentlie insulting, to interpret our silence to the aduantage of their owne and weaknes of our cause, yet, they stick not to professe, that, whatsoever we either writ or reply against thē, they neither may nor will vouchafe to read it: but, much more inequitable, heerein, then the fellowes of Iehu, they heare no sooner (you know the man and what his talke was) but they condemne it flatlie as false, &amp; yet will not in any case (no not thereafter) heare it told them, least perhaps, vpon some respectes,

               ▪ what, sufficientlie, might haue stayed their hearts against all the obiections of the adversaries: I, then, for mine owne part, thought best, by opening vp the booke of the Revelation, to manifest so to all men (having eies) the mysterie of godlines, &amp; that, also of iniquitie, impugning it, that the judicious and attent Reader might both be instructed against their deceit, and also made skilful to discerne so, their trumperies, that, neither al the gold, skarlet, pearle, and precious stones, wherwith the whoore goeth masked, shuld hide her nakednes, not her golden cuppe cover the abominations fraudfullie propined therinto. Which, as by the helpe of God, in some measure, I performed, &amp;, at the request of the godly, have made publik, that my p

               ines, so, had I resolved never any more to put pen to paper, at least, in this polemick kinde of writing. But, a godlie brother, of the ministrie, sending to me of late, a litle (whither a Iesuits or Priests) Pamphlet, whereof some written copies were sparsed in the coūtrie, in the author his intent, proving the Ministers of the Protestant Churches to haue no lawfull calling, and that cō
               sequentlie, with vs is neither any true church, nor true Sacramēts: to the which he was requested by a well affected Gentleman to make an answer: and, desiring therevpon, to know my iudgement in the general question, I, accordingly, affoorded him a sheet of paper. at which time two or three godly Gentlemen falling to be in companie with me, and knowing of the matter, they at that time, &amp; soone after, some of the ministry also, were instant with me, that, what, in my privat lettre to that Brother, I had shortlie pointed at, I would for common vse, somewhat more at

length set downe: that the wel affected might have wherwit

                  •
               eir incident occasions of cōference about such matter. For whose satisfaction, I have, heereby, not so much set my selfe to encounter with any one (for their treatises in great penurie of matter, are, most part, spent in false personall crimination and calumnious railings, which I disdaine to answer) as shortlie to give to the godly a common antidot against all, by answering such of their maine obiections, as, wherto all the rest easilie may be reduced, that, seeing by force of truth, they are now at last driven (dispairing of the matter it selfe) for all other argument, to quarrel our callings, this sarie shift may be wrung from them also. Wherin, they may bee fitlie compared to those pleaders, who, being out of all hope of their cause, labour to cast the court: Or to such men, against whom an authentick reversion &amp; good money being produced, for outquyting from them a possession, which, otherwayes, they can find no right to detaine, they run, by all meanes, to annull the order. But, as, at the Barr, it were a preposterous order of pleading, after peremptorie argumēts proponed, to returne to delatours, so, when the head of all defence is placed in them, it argueth, that, even in the conscience of the proponer, the peremptours are invalid.
            2. Thus, the Priestes and Scribes of the Iewes (whose successours, and of whose spirit these men bewray themselves to be) when, after many assayes against Christes doctrine, they were ever put to the worse in the end (pryding themselves, and with a great deale more reason then doe our adversaties, in that ordinarie place which they brooked in the Church) for all argument they come at last to this,
                  Math. 21. from the 23. verse to the end.
                
               By what authoritie doest thou these thinges; and who gave thee this authoritie
               ▪ where the Lord answering for him self, then, and for vs now, in the like case, most plainly, &amp; at length sheweth, that, howsoever in the ordinarie course of a constitut Church, a carefull regard must be had to the ordinarie calling, yet, when (as sometime it falleth) that the ordinarie

husband-men become murtherers, and the ordinarie builders become destroyers, there God, extraordinarilie stirreth vp men, whose ministrie prooveth itself to be from heaven and not from men, even by this, that they 
                  
                     •
                  ome in the way of righteousnes: and sinners are converted by them, that, so the Lord of the vineyard may report fruit thereof, even when the ordinarie husbandmen rebel, and that the stone, rejected, even of the ordinarie builders, may yet bee made the head of the corner: which, howsoever it bee marvailous in our eies, yet it is the Lord his doing.
            3. Now, this alone, without furder, though we have no more ordinarie vocation then our adversaries alledge, yet (in so great a confusion brought in the Church by Antichrist, and, in such evidencie of truth in our side) it sufficientlie answereth for our calling. And, albeit that perhaps it not onely may, but also ought to be brought in defence of some particular men, who, wāting som ordinarie points of an ordinary vocation, yet comming in the way of righteousnes, and, in evidencie of spirit and power, cōverting sinners and convincing errour, witnessed, clearelie, their ministerie to bee from heaven: yet, for our Church, in common, I see no necessitie to have recourse heereto. For, whatsoever our adversaries may pretend, heerein, against some particular persons, whose defect, if it any were, hurteth not the Church in common, yet, I marvaill with what face they can denye our first open contesters with Antichrist, in common, to have beene ordinarie Churchmen, bearing publike charg of Pastours or Doctours therin. And, that I goe not higher, what, iustlie can they lay, heerein, against VViclesse, Iohn Husse, Hierome of Prague, and the Bohemian reformed Churches? against Luther, Melan

                  thon, &amp;c. of the Churches of Germanie, and whatsoeuer cavillation, their peruerse contentious mindes may suggest to them against these. yet, what pretence can they have against the ordinarie vocation of so many famous Bishops and Pastours of the Church of England▪
               
Yea, and who of our first Preachers were not either ordinarie Church-men, ere then had their admission to the Ministerie by the reformed Churches of England, Geneva, or Germanie? If they were not blindlie miscarried, they might perceave, that, what they speake and write of our men in derision and contumelie, (calling them Sir Iohn Kn

And, giving, that nothing might bee alledged for the ordinarie vocation of our first Preachers, and, that it were als essentiall a defect as our adversaries account it, so as they had, thereby, a iust exception against our Church: yet, I pray you, what doth this helpe them against the Church of England, and so many other famous reformed Churches, all agreeing in communion with vs, and glad to give vs the right handes of fellowship? What a peevish pretence is this for their errour; and how weak an obiection against so many famous Churches convincing them, that, forsooth, the Ministers of Scotland, have no ordinarie calling? But, neither is the want of ordinarie vocation in our first Reformers, anie iust exception against our Church (as partlie, alreadie, and more at length, heereafter, shall bee shewed) neither, if it were,

yet with alse high &amp; iust commendation both of learning and holynes, as ever thereafter. And, if it cannot be denyed but such was the estate of our Church, then, dare they condemne those men for theeves &amp; who vnlawfullie had broken in vpon the sheepfolde; whom they them selves have both superstitiouslie canonized, and, do still, idolatrouslie worship? Or, if that was no essentiall defect in them, or a relevant exception against our Church then; how impudent are they, therevpon, to conclude so peremptorilie against vs, as if all both light and life of a true Church did hange wholy vpon that one point of Episcopal ordination? whereof, when all is graunted that the most vehement (and not shameles) assertours thereof, in al their partiall heat and all probable apparance can plead for: yet, besides a cleare shewed instāce of more then two hundreth yeares practise in our owne Church, and that in the primitive and most pure times thereof, their owne schooles also (in the height of palpable prevailing darkenes) have given vs, yet, this to answer them, quod ad actum moraliter bonum non requiritur vt à vera prudentia reguletur actus, sed satu est si ab ignorantia invincibili &amp; errore non imputabili reguletur.

            5. Where-vpon this our acclaiming even of ordinarie calling, they inferre against vs, that, we iustifie them to be the true church, and that, consequently, we have made defection therefrom: in so farre as we could have no such ordinarie vocation, but with and amongst them: it is a childish fallacie from themselves but a part in the Church, and yet not of it (even the abhomination of desolation stāding in the holy places,

                  •
                each one) it is a deceitfull aequivocation.
            6. Here, yet, they think vs intangled in a great incōvenient, for that the Bishop of Rome (whom we hold to be Antichrist) having bin for som ages acknowledged ministerial head of the church: &amp;, the outward ordinatiō of al churchmen either mediatly or immediatly flowing frō him, wee must cōfesse vs to have no ordinarie calling at all, or then that we have it from Antichrist. so as they think vs hereby reduced to one of these necessities, either to refuse al ordinary vocatiō, or then, for maintaining of our ordinary callings, to iustifie their Pope from whō they have proceded, and, so, cōsequently, to cōdemne al our owne both church &amp; doctrine. But, while they think vs intrapped, we are by an open way escaped: for, we both yeeld that our ordinary vocatiō, hath, outwardly in a sort, proceded frō the Bishop of Rome, &amp; that he is notwithstanding, that very Antichrist &amp; man of sin. And, to shew how these two so apparātly repugnant points do yet very wel cōsist, without any either discredit or derogation to the dignitie or lawfulnes of our callings: we have rightly to wey the distinct cōditions of Antichrist, as he cōmeth to be diversly cōsidered in his first hatching, yea &amp; the many insensible, flow, &amp; long succeeding degrees of his grouth towards that height, whereby against al that is called god, Satan his throne was erected in the mids of the church: and againe, in that toppe of impietie, whereto the mystery of iniquitie did mount vp by time,2. Thes. 2.4. Revel. 2.13. 
               nemo enim repente fit turpissimus (for none becommeth extreamlie evill at once) for, even from the Apostolike times that mischiefe was a workinge, and, albeit, first,

by slow and insensible,2. Thes. 2.7. 1. Iohn 4.3. and next by more speedie and sensible degrees: and, even in the height thereof, it had yet two degrees. In that, first, like a fraudulent Parde, albeit having on his head the name of blasphemie, the beast deceaved, and as,
                  Revel. 13.1.2. 
               Balaam, crastily laying stumbling blockes, bewitched the earth,
                  Revel. 2.14. as in Pergamus. And secondlie, by increase of crueltie and impietie, he became all of the Dragon his colour, and had his whole body full of the names of blasphemie:
               
                  Revel. 17.3.6. the Whoore borne vp by him, being drūkt with the blood of Saintes,
                  Revel. 2.20. and furiouslie, as Iezabel an impudent cruell queein, domining in Thyatira. and yet still, in both these states, he was long so borne out with Propheticall pretence, as,
                  Revel. 2.13.14.19.20. even the true Church lurking vnder and within his compas (where Sathan his throne was) yet had her eyes so dazeled and courage so quailed with the glistring shew &amp; proud pretence of Pastorall and Propheticall authoritie, that, howsoever shee keeped her selfe pure from his spirituall fornication, and held the name of God, yet shee had not either the knowledge or courage to challenge directlie the impious vsurpation; which, was, indeed, an argument of the true Church her weaknes, and that Christ had therein, somewhat against her, but no argument for all that, why either she, so dwelling, &amp; in weaknes, tolerating that evill, was not the true Church, or that Balaam and Iezabel, thus tolerated of her, were not that false prophet, and mysticall whoore.
            7. An other consideration of Antichrist, is, that hee is no outward enemie openlie and directly fighting against the ensigne of profession and name of Christ, but an inward traytour, deceaving by the ensigne: and that so cunninglie and covertlie, as, a long time, not only his characterized ones (who only of his favoures are partakers both of his treason and endles iudgement) but also many simple sheepe deceaved by the semblance of the Lambe his hornes,
                  Revel. 14.9.10. and 16.2. and in singlenes of heart following the ensigne, were made so to follow him, and to receave his name. albeit they receaved never his character, nor learned the

deeepnes of Satan.
                  Revel. 13. &amp; 2.24. and, many also, who never either receaved character or name, yet lurking within him, and shrouded vnder the common ensigne of profession, receaved the number of his name (that is, were numbred and counted to be his) albeit, in effect, they were none of his, either by acceptation of character or name.
                  Revel. 11.2. &amp; 13.5. For, hee treading downe the holy Citie &amp; Court of the Temple (that is, domining and ruling in the visible church) and, along time, ouerthrowing, therein, all true worshippe, as did Iezabel in Israel 42. monethes, or three yeares and a halfe, &amp; Antiochus Epiphanes, in Ierusalem, the same space: all which time of his vsurpation, the true church within his compas. continuallie lurking, as the Temple within the Citie and Court: No other possible accesse could bee to the Temple (the true Church) but through the Citie and Court (the visible Church):2. Thes. 2.4. wherein, Antichrist sitting, that is, Domining, all Christians behooved, of necessitie, to ioine to that body where was the common ensigne, which, howsoever, or by whomsoever caried,

                     redends.
                yet it was ever oportunum inquirendi exordium (convenient entrie to inquire by). and, so, alwayes, many comming thither, and spying the pollution of the Citie and court of the Temple, they stepped in to the Temple: where, continually (therefore in a close and deepe wisdome, that case is numbred by dayes) al the time of Antichrist his most absolut prevayling,
                  Revel. 11.3. was the true church, and true and faithfull Ministers of grace and light: and albeit few, and long lurking, &amp; in heavines, yet powerfully dispensing light and grace, &amp; free from open and barbarous persecution:
                  Revel. 10.8. 
               till the little booke opened, and obtained out of the hand of the great Angell, and greedilie and sweetlie swallowed, inabled, and stirred them, by the right measuring reed,
                  Revel. 11.1.2. to examine the church, and thereby, to finde that citie and court were to bee cast out. whereat the beast (Antichrist) highly chaffed,
                  Revel. 11.7 &amp;c.
                murthereth first, even with applause, those true Ministers. But, God, still stirring vp others in the same spirit, at last, a visible separation is made, not from the Church (as our adversaries vainlie

pratle) but from Antichrist and the long covered traitour in the church. So as, then, truth and true professours, within the church &amp; onely of the church, but long borne down and lurking through prevailing errour, at length begun to becom visible (to the terrour and astonishment of their adversaries) and to obtain and beare sway, by the discoverie &amp; fall of Antichrist. Whose sacrilegious impietie, having come to such height, as it could no longer bee covered or borne,
                  Revel. 11.12. it was then, said to the revived witnesses, Come vp hither, and their enemies saw them and were afrayde, that is, the long lurking, afflicted, and at last murthered ones become visible, even to their enemies, who, first, imagined none such to bee, and next, that they could bee no more: and to their griefe and terrour, are seene and knowen to beare away the title of the true Church, in that place (as through all that Prophecie) signified by the name of heaven, in opposition to the earth and earthlie ones. Wee have not only stronge and invincible argumentes, but even, therewith, such cleare foretolde storie of all the ryfinge, grouth, doctrine, dealing, and fall of Antichrist: And of the continuall manner of God his gracious dispensation towardes his true Church, lurking vnder him, afflicted by him, and victorious over him, as that, wherein our adversaries glorie most, turneth most to their shame, and, that, wherewith they most reproache our Church, speaketh stronglie for vs. And the Lorde his wise providence, for preserving, thus, his Church, in the middes of Antichristian vsurpation, while he appeared to possesse all, was wonderfull in that, even in time of greatest corruption: yet a sure accesse and free way was still reserved and kept, thorough the Citie and Court, to the Temple, the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance remayning, and the doctrine of the Trinitie beeing kept sounde.
            8. Wee are so farre from denying to Antichrist a place, yea and an ordinarie calling in the Church, that wee affirme

constantlie, that so it must have beene: And, that, not onely hee behooved to bee in it, but also Sit, that is, beare rule therein.2. Thes. 2.4. Revel. 2.13. 1. Iohn 2.19. But so, wee grant him to bee in it, as yet hee is none of it, more then a boile or apostume, in the body, is a member of the body. so wee grant him to have had rule, and ordinarie calling in the Church, as had these Husband-men, to whom, indeed, the Vineyard was set,
                  Math. 21.38. &amp;c.
                but, they murthered the heire, such an ordinarie builder wee confesse him to bee, as reiecteth that stone, which yet, in despyte of him, becommeth head of the corner.
                  Math. 21.42. Wee yeeld him the ordinarie vocation of a Pastour, but that hee is a wolfe: to have beene, sometime, a starre of heaven, and minister of light, and of the keyes of the kingdome, but, to have fallen to the earth, to have changed the keyes of heaven, in those of the bottomlesse pit,

                  Revel. 12.8.9. by Michael his valour, so powerfullie cast downe from heaven, had never againe bene able, by the beast of his authoritie, to erect his throne even in the Temple of God, if hee had not pretended the Lambe his hornes:
                  Revel. 13.2 2. Thes. 2.4. Revel. 2.13. Revel. 13.11. Iudges 14.18. neither had hee ever bene able to sende out our Sampson his ridle, if hee had not plowed with his heifer.
            Now, then, seeing that Antichrist of an order &amp; succession of degenerating Pastours (and that not at once, but slowlie and by degrees) hath slylie arissen to that height of impietie, as a beast rising out of the earth, (Sensim imperare incipiebat religio, habenas imperij capere, ius suum acquirere, nibil subitum nihil tumultuarium (sayth their owne parasite Steuchus: And,
                  Revel. 13.11. seeing that alwayes, before his discoverie, the pretence of the common ensigne carried him out: and, that, there-through, many true, both Pastours and Professours, receaving his name, or his number, but not his character, did come in singlenes, to the cōmon ensigne, &amp; not properlie to him:

he brooked stil the place of an ordinarie Pastour: and, seeing that outward ordination, and all the action of the ministers thereof, serveth but for outward order, all inward gift, grace, power and vertue comming from God the author of the calling: what absurditie is it, that a good Pastor receave ordination of a wolfe, who yet hath the place of an ordinarie Pastour in the Church, more then a true Christian to receave the Sacraments from a reprobate, being alwayes an ordinarie minister, which sacraments, yet by the inward cooperation of God are effectuall to the receaver? for, it is sufficiēt for an outward ordinarie calling, that the minister thereof have outward place and power of ordination, albeit he be but a hireling and a thiefe: and the receaver of outward ordinarie vocation, as he hath al gift and grace from God only, whose the work is, so, is he not tied or sworne to the will or appetit of the outward minister, but only to the Lord: no more then any minister baptizeth in his owne name,1.

So, as, who, therevpon, would evince me to have made defection frō the church, because I impugne the heresie of him who gave me ordination: or that, finding him to be a wolfe, and both giving warning thereof to others, and my self shrinking from him, that, so doing, I either had no ordinarie vocation at all, or thē had fallen from it: I thinke that any of sound and setled senses would advyse to minister to him rather Hellebore for his braine, then any other answer.
            9. Now, then, albeit our adversaries be more then impudent to deny our ordinarie vocation, and, it were, in vs, but childish simplicitie, in such evidencie thereof, to grant them any apparant advantage: and, albeit it harmeth nothing our cause, that our outward calling hath, in a sorte, flowed from the Bishop of Rome: whose long vsurpation in the church,
                  Revel. 13.11. 2. Thes. 2.4. so litle dismayeth vs, as, rather it confirmeth vs the more, Antichrist being so proper a soare of the body of the church, as that he can befal none other body: &amp; thus,

though no otherwayes, yet even by sight of the soare, in, but not of the body, being sufficientlie assured that, certainlie, the true body was there: yet, in so cleare and direct an answer and solution of this question given by Christ him selfe,

Yea we are so farre from this disorder, and do so farre both reverence and maintaine ordinarie vocation, that, in a constitute Church holding the foundation (albeit otherwayes, divers things, therein, did require reformation) if any man of how great giftes soever, yet without ordinarie calling, should intende him selfe to be a Pastour: we would no otherwayes account of him, then of a seditious and turbulent spirit, who either, fanaticklie presuming of graces, would vainlie despise order, or, for some infirmities and defectes, would arrogantlie and vncharitablie, breake the vnitie of the Church.

In such a case, God both heretofore hath, and alwayes may send out men extraordinarilie, who, comming in the way of righteousnes, and in evidence of truth and power, convincing the ordinarie husbandes to be thieves, and the ordinarie builders to bee destroyers, even thereby sufficientlie verifie their ministerie,

                  Math. 16.18. Math. 28.20. Namely, that the church can not erre. For hath not the Lord builded her on a rocke, so, as, the gates of hell cannot prevaile against her? hath he not promised to be alwayes with her til the consummation of al things, and end of the world? we grant all these goodly and great

promises made to the church: we both reioyce &amp; glory of them in the Lord, &amp; know assuredly, that he, who is faithfull and true, holdeth well his height. But, their conclusion, hereupon (in their sense) hath a wordle of aequivocations. For, first, albeit it be most certain, that God never so abandoneth his church, as that, finally &amp; fundamentally, she falleth from truth, or is miscaried with errour: but that still, even in most desperat cases, shee hath in her both the light and life of God, yet, hereupon, to inferre, at all times and in all and every thing, such an absolut perfection as is mixed with no degree of errour or infirmity, it cōcludeth not. Neither is shee for this, rejected, or not esteemed the true and beloved church of God, for that hee hath somewhat against her, but lovingly, therupon, exhorted to amēdement.

Cor. 13.9 perfectly, at any time. And, yet, the Lord, according to his promise, leadeth her in all truth, for that, by degrees, he bringeth her on to perfection: and, notwithstanding of her owne weaknes, &amp; of all the gates of hell assailing her, yet errour &amp; lies never so provaile, but that she keepeth the name, &amp; liveth the life of God: And, in the end, victorious over all vntruth,
                  Ephes. 5.17. she is perfyted in all veritie.

            12. Now, again, when, in a right sense (such as I have shewed) it is granted that the Church can not erre: what, I pray you, is our aduersaries avantage herein? except that▪ still, impudently they take that which is in question. For, even herby, we argue thē not to be the church, because they have erred, and that both foullie and fundamentally. And, thus, again, they fall in a second, and their owne ordinarie aequivocation: concluding from them selves, the boile, apostume, and excrement of the Church, in it and not of it, to the true Church and promises proper to her, whereof they vainly and falslie boast: ridiculouslie pleading truth

to be with them, because they, forsooth, are the Church: where their right defence were, by evincing the truth to be with them, which is the life of the Church, so, to vindicateiustlie to them selves that title.
            13. For strengthening of them selves in this vsurpation, they fal to a third aequivocation. The church (say they) is alwayes visible. and, in so farre, as, for some ages, no other church can be shewed which was not of their communion, it evinceth them to be that true Church, which can not nor hath not etred. And, here, they display all the force of their eloquence the Church being the sheepfold of the sheepe,

That, which I have already said of the arysing, groneth, and successe of Antichrist and of the condition of the true Church vnder him and within his compas, answereth sufficiently to this aequivocation, whereby, deceitfully, they reason from the visible Church to the truth and true Church alwayes in the visible Church, but not alwayes visible in it: except in a sort, for that the visible church and commō ensigne ever telleth where they are. When we affirme the church to be invisible, it is not that wee deny her to bee and to haue alwayes bene visible in the common ensigne of publike Profession. But, to infer herevpon, that truth and true professours, alwaies in her, &amp; onely of her, are at al times visible, obtaine,

For, though the ordinarie husbandmen becom murtherers and the ordinarie builders becom destroyers, yet the Lord still maintaineth his promise, reporteth fruit of his vineyard, &amp; buildeth his house, by stirring vp others extraordinarilie, who come in the way of righteousnes, and this, is their fourth aequivocation in this their stout affeveration (that the Church can not erre): for that not only they conclude from the Church to Pastours, a part of the Church (which we could passe with them,) but, that also, from the necessitie of Pastours, indefinitlie, they conclude, definitlie, &amp; sophisticallie, of ordinarie Pastours.

                  Revel. 7.3. &amp; 9.4. &amp; 11.3. &amp; 14 1.2.3. Yea, I am perswaded (neither that by coniecture only, but by cleare warrant of scripture) that in all ages, evē in most corrupt times of Antichrist, God stil had a number of true and godly Pastors: and, that, not only in them, but also by them, hee preserved light and life in his church, howsoever for their tolerating in weaknes of spirituall fornication,
                  Revel. 1.14. 
               he had something against them. But, heere, our adversaries fal in the fift, &amp; that same aequivocation, in the case of pastours, wherby they deceave, in the case of the church. as if because truth still abydeth with, &amp; by the ministrie of Pastors, that, therfore, al, or most part of Pastours

did ever hold the truth, or that amongst Pastours in common truth did, alwayes, obtaine and beare sway: for it is most cleare and certain, that howsoever vniversallie each one never do fal from the light &amp; life of God, yet whē that carnallie presuming of God his promises, and of their ordinarie place in the church, they become secure, and abuse their place to fulfil their owne lustes: that then, they both may and have communiter omnes (al in common) fallē away: from the Prophet even to the Priest everie one following after his:

                In which case, for magnifying of his truth and power, and for their confusion, the Lord hath &amp; may extraordinarilie stirre vp men in the way of righteousnes to doe his work.
            16. But, whatsoever (say they) might bee presumed of Pastours in common, yet, being assembled in Counsell or Synode, they can not so fall from truth. As if, forsooth, where all the members are, apart, bad &amp; infected, that togither they could make vp a good or sound body. Yea, as we have alreadie cleared, that the argumētation from the church, or promises made thereto, to ordinarie Pastors in common, is vicious: and, from the ordinarie Pastours al in common, to vniversallie each one, is much more halting: so, here even from the whole Pastours vniversallie, to the generall counsell, it is still faultie. For no generall counsel can be brought, but that, albeit al, therein, had erred, yet numbers of ordinarie Pastours were besides, who might have holden the truth. O, but the Counsels have a special promise of the Lord his presence, as which doe represent the whole church, and he blesseth, his owne ordinance. This is still impudently to oppone one &amp; the same thing. I denie not but the Lorde hath promised,
                  Mat. 18.19 that where or whensoever two or three assemble in his name, he wil be

in the midst of them. And, I am perswaded, that no number, how small soever, of lawful pastours (hauing God and his honour singlie before their eies, and proponing, and following onely his reveiled will, and in Christian love agreeing in one, &amp; in that disposition, humblie &amp; heartily in calling to the Lord) did ever assemble themselves, or shall at any time convene, which have not found and shal not find the truth of his promise. That no man esteeme me, herby, to loose a liberty for men to contemne God his ordinance in the assemblies of his Church, more then, before, in the meane of preaching of the worde. But, I pray you, had ever the Lord so limited him selfe, that al counsels shal vndoubtedly &amp; alwayes so assemble, as they may be ever secure of that promise? miserable experience, in all ages, hath taught vs clearlie the contrarie. So as the holy

               an Nazienzen did not stick to say, that hee never did see any good effect of counsels. And Constantin the Emperour, in his epstle to the Synode of Tyrus, roundly telleth them

                that, in all the dealings of Bishops, hee could see nothing but an overthrow of al religiō. So while men ar miscaried with the spirit of contention, bitternes, pryde, avarice, ambition, and selfe-love, they cannot, indeed, make the promise of God of none effect, which, alwayes abydeth stedfast, but, they depryve thēselves of the fruit therof.

The Romanists themselves perceaving well how weake &amp; incertain a warrant of truth, is either the cōmunalty of pastours or the decrees of counsels, which, as Cadmus his race, each, al most, destroy other: they, in end, leave al other refuge, and come to the Bishop, of Rome, and doe cō

Thus, as men mated with maintaining an vnequall match for a wrong cause, their last defences are feeblest. Wherein, albeit, not onely they be destitut of all warrant either of Scripture or sound Antiquity, but that even a great part also of their owne Clergie are ashamed therof: yet their Iesuits &amp; Seminaries are stil more then extreemly impudent. It is inded, true that some of the ancient fathers attributed much, yea and too much to the church of Rome, &amp; reverenced greatlie both the iudgement and authority thereof: by reason of so many famous Bishops, who still, in that seat, had, both holden soundlie, the true faith themselfes, and had bene great ayders and conforters of others,

who in diverse parts did stryve and suffer for it. And, in this, men otherwayes learned and holy, were not only too liberal, but, even beyond measure prodigal: because whatsoeuer either praise or prerogative they could have on the church of Rome (as the course of things, then went) it made for the credit of their cause: Satan, even thus, subtillie plowing with God his owne heifer, for fetting forward the mysterie of iniquitie: which (mynding, simplie, but the defence of the good cause in the tyme) these good men were not ware of. But, such an vnbridled &amp; blasphemous licence, as the Popes, since, have vsurped &amp; taken to them selves, and their Canonistes and Parasites have given them, these god-fathers never dreamed of. As any who readeth their writtes and stories, and, with iudgement, considereth the cases and condition of these tymes, will easely perceave, and bee never a whit troubled, with the hyperbolick and partly evill vnderstood; partly false and supposititious praise, and priviledges given to that seat. Wherewith when any of the Bishops of Rome, being too much tickled, did, presse thereupon, to vsurpe intolerably, they were thē, oftner then once not only resisted, but also their ambition freely checked and gravely rebuked.

But as the Romane Doctours are extreemlie impudent, so, any broken sentence or wrested authoritie, is good enough to blind the ignorants: whom God, iustly, giveth vp to believe lies because they delite in errour: giving them, therefore, heape of Teachers according to their humours. Now, how far, they are destitut of all sure warrant, and yet, how farre, in giddines of mynd, and force of the bewitching cuppe of fornicatiō, they are carried to maintaine this absurd and monstrous opinion, is cleare, if it were but by this, that they are not ashamed to bring an instance and argument from Caiphas, prooving that the Popes cannot erre in the chaire, in that, by vertue thereof, he did prophecy that one must die for the people.

                by that saying (in a hudge misterie) to resigne the Priesthood and instal Christ therein. Thus rather then he should appeare to brooke any thing but by ordinarie succession; making our Lord, who was neither of that tribe, nor of that order, but a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedeck, to bee successour, in a sort to Caiphas. And, it is the Lord his iust iudgement, that, who sel themselves to maintain lies, they bee given over to such absurd &amp; blasphemous suggestions. But, what a blindnes is this; to catch hold of that one word, which was no definitive sentence of the chaire, but a bloody advyse, for incouraging the rest of his consistorie to passe roundly over all points of conscience or equity in that matter, for that, howsoeuer they could find no iust pretence against Christ, yet, in any sort, it were better that one man should die, thē that, by the peoples believing in him and cleaving to him, the Romans should be stirred to destroy the whole natiō? why passe they by these sentences, in the chaire, whereby all were excommunicated who confessed the Lord Iesus, and, whereby, the Sonne of GOD was convicted and condemned

of blasphemie? Will they rather subscribe these sentences, then grant an errour in the chaire? Or, if these cannot bee excused, how ridiculous are they, for prooving an impossibilitie of erring in the chaire, to produce amongst a number of execrable and blasphemous errours, one reckles worde vnwittinge spoken? Neither did the holy Ghost in noting that speech, meane any such matter, as these men, to strengthen their owne imaginations, fondlie build thereon. But, to shew, that Caiphas, while hee was vtterly corrupted, and but set onely on mischiefe, yet, by the all and overruling power of him, who hath al both hearts and tounges in his hand, did speake such wordes, as howbeit hee neither so vnderstood nor mynded them, yet, if in vprightnes and knowledge they had beene vttered in that sence which the wordes might have borne; and according to that event, which contrarie to the speakers mynd, the all and overruling hande of God brought about: that, then, they had well besiemed that place which that wicked man did occupy. Such a prophet then, was Caiphas, herin, as was the Devil, when, mynding but blaspemie, deceit, and murther, hee told the woman, that, eating of the forbiddē fruit, they should become lyke vnto God. For, indeed, out of man his fal, much cōtrarie to Satans mynd, the Almightie wrought that hudge and incomprehensible worke of the manifestation of God in the flesh: and making, thereby all true believers, partakers in a sort, of the divine nature. And, such a prophet for vs, let their Pope be, as, who, being continuallie set on lying and murthering, yet never prophecieth true, but when the overruling power of GOD bringeth some such thing to passe, which, albeit his wordes might beare, yet, he neither mynded not willed. Yea, this example of Caiphas so little helpeth them, that, thereby, evidentlie, all whatsoever they bragge of generall Counsels, and of their Pope even in the chaire, is seene to be foolishe. For, I pray you, what instance can they bring of a more lawfull Counsell, or, of a Pope more solemnely sitting in the chaire (as touching

all outwards requisite for the lawfulnes either of persons or ordinarie power) then were, both that whereby Ieremy was convicted; and this againe, whereby our Lord was condemned as a blasphemer?
            18. But, as, men, who disput more, for maintayning, any way, their point, then for resolution, being sore pressed, doe seeke all corners: so, heere, they alledge, that, howsoever such a decay might have befallen the Church vnder the law: yet, of the Christian Church, vnder the Gospel, in so large a measure of light, and ample promises, no such thing ought to be presumed. Wherein, besydes an evident halting in Logike, is also a horrible &amp; open blasphemy in divinitie. The fallacie is, that, from the measure of dispensation, &amp; of the promises made, they reason to the truth of God in performing. It is true, that vnder the law, albeit they had one and the same covenant, in substance, and the same promises: yet not in a like measure, or cleare manner of dispensation. Now, heerevpon, to conclude, because God promised not so clarelie nor plentifullie opened, his grace, that, therefore, he performed not alse truelie what hee height: It is, first, a vicious argumentation, and, iuxt, a contumelious blaspemie against the truth of God. For as a true man promising a cottage to one, and a kingdome to another, is alike true in both albeit not alike liberall: so, is God, alwayes, in whatsoever or in what measure soever hee promised. His Church was his Church alwayes, and, truth, alwayes, was the lyfe of his Church: and, hee prooved, alwayes, alike true, in maintayning it in a sparkle, as hee did in keeping it in a shyning toarch. If they answere, That they doe not meane, that, for the common errour of the Priestes, Prophets and ordinarie Church-men vnder the Law, that therefore, either the promise of God failed, or his Church perished, then, wee have all we plead for. For what, I pray you, letteth him; Or is his arme now shortened; that he may not in the like manner and in the like cases preserve his Church? And, if, in a common apostasie of ordinarie Church-men

both Prophets &amp; Priestes, he yet hath, heretofore, still had a Church, why doe our adversaries make no end of bitter contention against vs? We have, indeed, great &amp; sure promises that the gates of hell shall not prevaile against his Church: but that the ordinarie Ministers, shall alwayes, and all, in common, holde the trueth, not one syllable, yea, contrarie, we have not only manie and serious warnings of false prophetes to arise in the bowells of the church, &amp; in sheepes clothing, but also most clearlie foretold, that such an Apostasie should come, whereby Antichrist in al effectual deceyt should even sit, and beare rule in the Temple of God. If they will saye, that the Church of Israel had not such promises of continuall presence and preservation of truth, as the Christian Church hath: It is a treacherous sophisme. For they had also sure promises of continuall presence and preservation of truth, according to the measure dispensed, albeit not of so great measure of presence and light. And as for that point, whereof our adversaries glorie most, and, wherein, now, at last, they are faine to place all defence (namelie, the prerogative of places and persons:) the Church of Israell had much more for them (in so ample and many promises made of Ierusalem, And to the house of Levie and familie of Aaron,) where as the Church vnder the Gospell (in which, neither at Ierusalem, nor in any mountaine, but every-where, and of all men, God is to bee worshipped in spirit and truth) albeit having great sure promises of presence and preservation: yet, of tying God or his truth to any places or persons, in all Scripture, shee hath not so much as any shew of a warrant; which, if the holy Ghost had minded, hee might, with much lesse ado, have reduced those many grave and earnest warnings given both by Christ in the dayes of his fleshe, and by his Apostles, thereafter, of the perill of false prophetes: and those carefull instructions of notes how to discerne and avoid them, to a short and sure compende against all fraude: bidding the Church but holde whatsoever the Bishop of Rome did holde, for, that hee,

forsooth, could not erre. If our adversaries yet oppone, that howsoever the Church vnder the Law did sometime fall away all in common, and, that, albeit the Christian Church should also in like manner, yet the truth of God his promises should not therefore faile: but, that no such thing hath befallen the Christian Church, or could befall her: in respect of the great measure of light and cleare dispensation by the Gospell. It is many wayes both foolish, and impertinentlie alleadged, for, first, it is a plaine taking of that which is in question. Next, as the state of our question is (whither possiblie, the Church may erre (communiter tota) and God his promise yet abyde true) to oppone, that shee hath not erred, is alse ridiculous as, if in disputation de iure, one should answer de facto. If God his promise still may consist, albeit shee did so erre, wee have the point wee pleade for. And, whither shee hath erred or not, they must of necessitie come with vs to trye by such rules of examination, as wee only labour to reduce them to, and they, in an evill conscience, alwayes, flee: onely crying against vs, The Tēple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord: And the Church can not erre. Thirdlie, this their presumption of the ones possible and easie falling away, and of the others assured standing in truth, grounded vpon the lesse and greater measure of light, it sheweth their foolishnes in divine matters. For, as, whatsoever measure of light dispensed, is God his free benefite, so is our either imbracing or abyding therein, his only gift. Who as hee iustlie will give over presumptuous and secure men to groape even at noone day,1. Corinth. 10.13. so, is hee faithfull and wil not suffer his owne to bee tempted above that they are able, but will give the issue with the tentation. Wee have, indeed, to glorifie God, and even to glorie in him, for the huge measure of light and gracefull dispensation by the Gospell: but so farre ought men to have bene from vaine boasting thereof, or carnall and secure relying thervpon, as, in all watchfulnes and godly care, they should have remembred, with all, that, accordingly Satan was to advaunce

And, as in the dealing of God, it is not to be esteemed strange, that he so farre gave over the world to the efficacie of errour (whereby he iustlie punished the contempt of his truth, and clearlie foretold the case) so, is it nothing derogatorie, either to his goodnes and truth of his promises made to his Church, or to his power of performance: as our adversaries, because the Lord (whom they would make a varlet to their lustes) hath iustlie cast dunge vpon their faces, therefore by a doting dilemma,

For, as his incomprehensible goodnes and constant truth, are, herein, magnified, that though all men be liers, yet hee abydeth true, and the infidelitie of men can not make his promise of none effect: so, did his infinite power exceedinglie extoll the selfe in this, that as hee bringeth light out of darknes, and maketh his light to shine in darknes: as hee bringeth

It followeth not, for recordes beare commonly, but what obtaineth in the tyme: so as, albeit some men, in each tyme, have, either opposed them selves to prevailing evils, or, at least, not beeing able to resist a speat of iniquity, have keeped them selves pure from the corruption, and were knowen to the Godly then: yet, as they were borne downe in the tyme, so, neither hath any record of thē come to the posteritie: through the tyrannie of such who, not onely, maister-fully, did set fordward wickednes, but also disposed of all registers and recordes of matters, at their pleasure: Daylie experience maketh this more then manifest.

How many will give open signification of miscontentment; whose both meaning and memorie yet wilbe buried from the posteritie? How many, in weaknes, will beholde, and tolerat, what they can not resist; or without evident danger cōdemne? How many, at the first signification of opposition, will bee silenced and terrified, with some such check as this; Art thou also of Galilie?

And, it was the Lorde his will, that, before open and full contestation, in the highest degree, his impious vsurpation should mount to the highest. While GOD gave even Iezabel tyme to repent her of her fornications,

Whose whoordomes, that the true servants of God did tolerat so long, it was, indeed, a point of weaknes in them, and, for which, the Lord had somthing against them, but, no argument, wherefore either they were not his true and beloved servantes, or yet, that they were not at al: as sophistically, our adversaries doe inferre. And, this their infirmitie, will appeare, yet, the lesse wonderful, if we consider how, with the degrees of arising impiety, antichrist, also, arose to greater &amp; greater impatiency of any cure: and to a tyrannicall intreating of opposers. At first, some freedom was of admonitions: therafter, they were repressed by deprivations, degradations, &amp; excommunications. At last, hee becommeth all and whollie of the Dragon his coulour, and barbarouslie sheddeth the blood of Saints.

But, corruption growing to such height (the beast not onely sitting in the holy city &amp; court of the temple, but also treadding downe all true worship therein) as, of necessitie, the right rod of examination behooved to be applied to discerne the temple (the true Church) and to trye, if City and court, being so far polluted, could possibly come in the account of God his house, or were to bee cast out. Then, the applying of the rod, made Antichrist to perceave such to bee within him, as he thought not of whom, when, thereupon, he had so cruellie murthered, even with applause of the blind worlde, as they seemed not onely to be no more, but, also, that their memorie was reproachfull and odious: yet, hee did find them revived, in greater strength, and, visiblie, at last to his griefe &amp; terrour, to obtaine the tytle &amp; account of the true Church: Wherat, his kingdome falleth.

Now, I hope, I have cleared, that, howsoever the promise of God can not faile, but that truth ever abydeth in the Church: yea, and by the ministrie of true pastours, is, and hath alwayes bene maintained therein: yet, neither have our adversaries anie thing whereof to boast heerein, as, who neither are the true Church nor true Pastours of it: neither, albeit both Church and Pastours communiter omnes (all in common) have fallen away from this truth, that it derogateth ought to the veritie of God

his promises: whom, as, it pleaseth, sometime, (for magnifying and manifestation of his truth and power, in man his falsehood and weakenes) to preserve his truth, in a smal sparkle, in, and by a few secret sealed ones: so, when hee will have it to breake foorth in a great fyre, for chassing away and dispelling all overclouding errour, hee both may and hath, at all such occasions, raise vp men extraordinarily, in the way of righteousnes, and in evidence of his spirit and power: to the iust conviction and confusion of them, who having the ordinarie place of husband men, in the Vineyard, yet were become murtherers and having the ordinarie place of builders of the house, yet were destroyers. Neither tendeth this, to open a doore, for anie, to despise the Church of God. Which, whosoeever heareth not,
                  Mat. 18.17 let him be a Heathen and a Publicane: Neither giveth it libertie to cōtemne the ordinarie means of God his dispensation by Pastours (seeing none, ordinarilie, can beleeve but by hearing,
                  Rom. 10.41. or heare, but by preaching) but, as I have said before, it is to waken Pastours to looke to their ministerie, and how they keepe the covenant of Levie: and not securilie to sleepe, and whyle they looke but to their own wayes,
                  Malach. 2. yet proudlie, to make God the varlet of their affections. And, on the other part, it is to stirre all Christians to a carefull studie to discerne betwixt the true church and the Synagogue of Sathan,
                  Revel. 2.9. calling themselves Iewes, and yet, are not: and betwixt true Pastours,
                  Math. 7.15. and false propheres, cōming in sheepes clothing, but within are ravening wolves: for it becommeth men not to be rechles in so important a matter. and, if it had not bene both a high and requisite point of wisedome, the Lord and his Apostles had not given so many sad and serious warnings to that effect.
            21. Here, now, as at the pulling from them of their Palladium, to the evident peril of their Pergamus, &amp; Satans throne in it,
                  Revel. 2.13. and the vndoubted subversion of their execrable Ilium, they cry out a great cry and a bitter. That, if thus, men once depart from the iudgement of the Church, what certain

warrant can they ever finde to stay on? or, What guyde can they be sure to follow; for finding out of truth? So; still, they cease not to dallie, and, shameleslie, in one sort. Wee would not have men to depart from the iudgement of the Church (which is the piller and stable seate of truth, and without which is neither veritie nor lyfe) but, howe much we are necessarilie to cleave thereto, so much the more carefullie, by the right rule of examination, to trye and discerne betwixt the Church, and the pretending harlot, and, to this end, the Lord hath given vs his word &amp; his spirit: and, in all ages, hath recommended them to his owne children, as vndoubted guydes, in all doubtfull cases, so vnder the lawe, men are ever exhorted to the lawe &amp; the Testimonie.

Peter, from an other spirit, then have our adversaries, calleth the word of the Prophets a sure and certaine word,1. Timoth. 3.14. &amp;c. Throughout

And, Paul, even vpon this that the Church is the house of God, the piller and stable seat of trueth, and that godlines is a great mysterie, groundeth both a reason why hee did write to Timothie, and an earnest exhortation, to take heed to the reading of the scripturs: for that many, diverting therefrō, and giving themselves to spirits of error and fables, should fall from the truth, and teach doctrines of Devils. We read many warning not to be miscaried with common errors or the authoritie of men: yea, as I have before touched, divers times, both Pastors and people, in common, are taxed for falling away from the word. We are exhorted, carefullie, to proove and try what word men doe offer vnto vs, but never, in all scripture, have we so much as one mine, of secure relying vpon the authoritie of ordinarie Pastors, without due examination, and the iudgement of al sound antiquitie accordeth hereto.

Christians, then, willing to receave the stable assurance of true doctrine, let them runne to nothing but to the scriptures, otherwayes if they look to ought else, they shall stumble and perish, not vnderstanding which is the true Church: and shall fall, hereby, in the abhomination of desolation which standeth in the holy places of the church. This same is yet more plainly shewed in these wordes, quum videritis, &amp;c. (that is) when ye shall see vngodly heresie, which is the armie of Antichrist, standing in the holy places of the Church, then, let them who are in Iudea, flee to the mountaines: that is, they who are of christianitie, addresse themselves to the scriptures: because, when once that heresie hath obtained place in these Churches, there can bee no tryall of true christianitie, neither any other refuge for christians willing to know the veritie of the faith, but the divine and holy Scriptures. And the same Chrisostome in the same place; Antea multis modis, &amp;c. before, many wayes was shewed which was the Church of Christ, but, nowe, no maner of way but by the Scriptures. Thus is cleare not only that the scripture is the sole rule of tryall: but that the necessarie reason why only to have recourse thereto is Antichrist his obtaining so farre within the Church, as, to escape the abhomination of desolation standing therein: also, wee must runne and runne only to the Scriptures.

And as Ierome sayeth both pleasantly and pertinently, When ever the Church looketh to any other warrant egreditur de finibus suis (she passeth out of her owne bounds) let any man, in whom is left any spunk of spirituall sense, conferre these sayings of the Fathers with the dealing and doctrine of Rome now, labouring ever to divert men from this Paradise of the Scriptures, where only is the fruit of lyfe, to a barren wildernes without water and Cisternes of their owne digging, and, thus, making millions to fall in that abhomination of desolation which standeth in the holy places of the Church, but their soares are seene, &amp; they shal prevaile no longer.
            22. They exclame, here, against vs, that, thus, we pervert all order in God his house: making every privat Christian iudge over Pastours, and subduing the spirit of the Church to every privat spirit. And, O how they both please themselves, and play themselves in amplifying the absurditie, as they think, of this point. But, to calme, a little, their chear heerein. First, I aske them, is it not a common direction for all Christians; to trye spirits, and not to believe every spirit?1. Iohn 4. 1. Thes. 5.21. Are we not cōmanded, to proove al things; &amp; to hold that which is good? Are we not often, &amp; carefully exhorted, to beware of false Prophets? While they cannot, or dare not (though they would) gainsay so cleare Scripture, they runne to this: that the only sure trial is, to acquiesce in the iudgement of the Church. But, shameles men, is not this all one thing as if they said, the best triall were to 
                  •
               se no triall at all? And what doe they, hereby, but still assume

the question? It is the true church, within the visible church, which we have to trie: and, how we shall rightlie discerne the bryde from the harlot. It is in a commō pretence and audaciouslie acclaimed title of the church, and prophetical authoritie, to discerne wisely the true church from the Sinagogue of Satan calling thēselves Iewes: and the voice of the true shepheard, frō the Dragon his mouth even in the temple of God. We wil acquiesce in the iudgment of the church: but, we must first know that it is she, and not a masket harlot vnder that name. Yea, and even then, not acquiesce simplie, because it is her voice, but because by the word and spirit, we perceave her to speak the words of the brydgrom: and that, therfore she is the bryde and true mother of vs all. O, but thus say they, you stil subiect the spirit of the church to everie privat spirit: &amp; make lay men iudges over Pastours, to whom Christ hath committed the governemēt of his house. If I aske them, what they do meane by this their distinction of a publike and privat spirit; what can they answer? ar their mindes so stil plunged in the pudle of their predicamēts, as they imagin the spirit of Christ to be a Species divided in individua? dare they say, that there be divers spirites, or, that the Church hath any otherwayes the spirit, but because al the mēbers of her body are indued with one and the same spirit; each according to the measure of the donation of Christ? there is but one spirit, albeit divers administrations and operations. Now, if every true member of the church hath one and the same spirit, for what vse have they it? Or dare any be so blasphemous as to imagine that the spirit of God cā be in any without some spiritual operations? have not the children of God the spirit, that, thereby they may both discerne the things of God; and be capable of them? for the naturall man can not: but the spiritual man discerneth al things &amp; is iudged of none. and, as the spirit of mā knoweth &amp; iudgeth the things of men, so doth the spirit of God, the things of God. Our adversaries here delude the simple with a deceitfull aequivocation: from that ordinarie prerogative

of governement and iudgement given to Pastours, concluding, falslie, of all spirituall sense and gust given to all and everie Christians, for iudging and discerning, heavenlie things, by the spirit of God in them. And, because the gift of dispensation, and ordinarie governement is peculiarlie given to Church-men, or Pastours, vnder an aequivocation, they wil spoile all and everie privat Christian of al spiritual sense, and discerning facultie: If a stewart of an house, to whom the dispensation is cōmitted of distributing food to the familie, did offer to a child or servant of the house a stone in stead of bread, or, a serpent for a fishe: and, if the child or servant did, therefore, reiect them: had he place, by reason of the dispensation committed to him, to quarrell either the child or servant, for vsurping his office? The horse, or oxe, which neither have the skill nor place given them by nature, to provide or dispense to themselves their foode: yet, by naturall sense, have allotted to them, this facultie, to discerne haye from thornes, and provander from gravel. Any common sensible man, which hath not the art either to teach himselfe or others musike, yet, naturallie, perceaved a ia

               e therein, and sturreth at it. and, hath his Maister of art place, herevpon, to expostulat that hee taketh too much on him? In divine matters, God, alone, properlie, is Iudge: and, the Church is index (that is declarer) non index (not iudge) of his will or word. No more then heraults of armes are iudges or discerners, but intimaters, of the Prince his pleasure: and, yet, in a peculiar manner, and by a speciall power, which no common subiect, may or dare vsurpe; who, yet, all of them have place to crave &amp; examine their warrant. that ordinarie and peculiar power of dispensation, governement, and iudgement, according to the warrant of God his word and will thereby, proper to publike office-bearers and spiritual heraulds, is one thing, and the spiritual gust or facultie given to all Christians, whereby to try &amp; discerne, whither it be food or poyson; a stone or bread; a fishe or a serpent, that is dispensed vnto them: whither it

be the voice of the sheepheard, which they heare, or the voice of a stranger, it is another thing, we admit not everie subiect to vsurpe the place of herauld, nor every sheep to vsurpe the office or power of a sheepheard. But, by the great sheepheard his own testimonie, we know, that whosoever are his sheepe,
                  Iohn 1

                  . they will discerne betwixt voices: and, so, learne to avoide the thiefe, &amp; follow the true sheephearde. These two, our adversaries, either maliciouslie or ignorantlie, and, sophisticallie, cōfound: vnder pretence of that which is the Pastours part, by aequivocation, pulling from the sheep, all spirituall sense: so, making them, in stead of lightened &amp; living mēbers of Christ, dead &amp; sensles: thus, to miscarie them whither they list. To Pastors we yeeld, alwayes, both the place &amp; honor of dispēsing food to the familie: yea &amp; that so far forth, as we absolve not any Christian from the necessitie of submitting himselfe to God his ordinance therein. But as Christ hath given his spirit to al his sheep, whereby they live spiritually: and, hath left his word to be the only food of his house, for fostering &amp; nourishing that life: so, we affirme, that al true sheep, even who hath neither the skill nor the power to be their owne carvers, have, yet, by his spirit in them (that vnction which teacheth all things) a spiritual discerning facultie to know what is propined them,1. Iohn 2.20. so, as even the weakest in that facultie, yet having in any measure, the true gust, albeit, in infirmitie, he wil be brought to muse &amp; doubt, ye &amp; somtime to mistake that for food which is not, yet as a mā seeking after some precious Iewell, though many things in apparance like it, present them selves to him, and even detain his mind, as doubting, but som of thē may be his darling: yet this is ever stil without satisfaction of heart. so as he cannot rest nor acquiesce, but still his mind giveth him that he is deceaved. and so hee, still searceth and sendeth after something, which he hath not, as yet, gottē: and if he could yet but once see, he would sone know. Vpon which having fallen, then as two wel accorded lutes, the one being stricken, the other also soundeth: so at the first sight,

his heart leapeth and is filled with ioye, his mynd with cleare light, and his soule with solide peace. And, then, he, disdainfully, casteth from him these counterfaits, which he never heartelie embraced. Is it not a strange impudencie, in these men; that, in so manifold warnings, given vs by our Lord, to trye well what wee embrace or hold; and in so faire a facultie affoorded vs by his spirit dwelling in vs, to proove things, that they notwithstanding, dare, so malapertlie, exact, of Christians, a blind obedience, and implicit faith? Who setteth any wares a seale, boasting of their fynesse, and, yet, in any case, will not have them lookt on, or tryed, but, will bee, blindlings, believed vpon his baire word: for me, I would never seeke any greater argument, that hee were a thiefe, and no true marchant. The Romanists plead, stoutlie, that the truth is with them: why? Because they are the Church, and why the Church? Because they have an ordinarie succession of Pastours since the Apostolik tymes. If, here, you vrge, that in so farre as, often, personall succession holdeth not the same doctrine, but, even all, in common, have and may fall therefrom, therefore, to approove themselves true successours to the Apostles, they must also verifie themselves to hold the same doctrine:
                  Act. 7.54. then their hearts brust for anger, and they will gnashe at you with their teeth, and crie out, fye on such an heretike as once thinketh such a blasphemie. That no such thing hath befallen, or possiblie could befall the Church. If yet they bee requyred, to bring, then, their doctrine to due examination, by the written worde. No: but you must, fide implicita, believe them vpon their word. And, albeit Scripture did seeme never so farre to condemne them, yet you must not suspect any evill of them, why? Because that is onely the true sense of Scripture which they approve, so as you must not so much as doubt, or once call in question their interpretation. And why? Because, foresooth, they are the Church. Is not this, proudlie to mocke God; and, impudentlie, to delude men? Is not this, to picke out the eies of the worlde,

to cary them, blindfolded, as oxen, to the slaughter; and, as fooles to the stockes, for correction? Augustin, pleading for the truth, and, having, trulie, for him all, which our adversaries doe, falslie, glorie of: yet, sheweth, that he was of another spirit, which taught him, that verity was otherwayes to bee defended, then by such subterfuges, as they, in an evill conscience flee to.

            23. But, this truth (say they) can neither bee shewed but by the church, which, only, hath it: neither could men bee otherwayes induced to beleeve the Gospell, except therewith, the authoritie of the church did move thē, as Augustin speaketh:

Yea we grant also, that, according to Augustin his mind in that place, the authority of the church is the ordinarie and necessarie motive whereby a infidell who neither knoweth Christ, nor beleeveth the Gospell, may &amp; wil be first induced to reverence religion: but it is but a cōmotive,

               non iam hominibus sed Deo intrinsecus mentem illuminante atque firmante. for, as in his testimonie little above cited, he saith, there be many things which be great motives to hold a man in the bosome of the church, yet trueth manifested is to be preferred to all, and, as truth is only in the church, and shewed onely by the Church, so is it, that, which only maketh the church to be the church, &amp; wherby, only, she is discerned. O, but all heretikes (say they) doe pretend the truth. yes verilie, and the name and title of the true church also, and so much the greater ought our attention and care be to examine all their pretences. For, bare pretence of truth, as it never yet did, so neither ever shall it be able to beare outfalshood longer, then by the right rule of examination it is reduced to due tryall. It is a great fallacie, because that truth can be no where found, but in the church, nor shewed by anie but by the church, and that the authoritie of the church, as a fit entrie to inquire by, first induceth men to reverence and seeke after the truth: therevpon, to conclude that truth, opened, hath no other vertue, or cleare note, whereby to be discerned from contesting errour, but the authoritie of men affirming it. For, being admitted to plead for it selfe, it is not so weak (as to blindfold men,2. Cor. 4.4. our adversaries would make thē believe) but that anie, whose eyes the prince of this worlde hath not pyked out, or, whose hearts, forstalled prejudices have not hardened, may easilie discerne it from lyes: indeed, these, to whom, in God his iustice, the mysteries of the kingdome are spokē in parables,

But, they to whom it is given to vnderstand them, wil clearlie &amp; wel. for a scorner seeketh wisedome and findeth it not, but knowledge is easie to him that will vnderstande.

all travell, taken for clearing truth but fruitles towardes such as God hath given over to the bewitching cuppe of fornicatiō. but, who neither in pride, singularitie, nor bitternes, are wedded to their owne will, or to the will and appetit of men. and, give a free and an vnforstalled heart to God,

For, the wise resolution of Gamaliel holdeth,
                  Act. 5.38.39. ever, true, that if the Counsell or worke bee of men, it will come to nought, but if it be of God, none can destroy it: but, even, in that wicked endeavour, they will be found fighters against God. The powerfull, yea &amp; miraculous prevailing light of the Gospell, whereby, against all the deceit, force, and malice of Satan, &amp; power of the world, Antichrist is so sensiblie going to destruction: that, howesoever they obstinatlie blaspheme, yet, they are gnawing their toungs for sorow: it sheweth sufficiently, what power is in the word of truth against al oppositiō whatsoever.
            
               24. And, this miraculous successe, and evident finger of God, wee, indeed, glorie of, in the Lord, who, thus, beareth witnes to the worde of his truth. Whereby as by the roare of a Lyon seconded with seven thunders, Antichrist is thunderstricken with astonishment and going, sensiblie, to pouder. Neither doe wee this, for that wee thinke vs holden to produce miracles for a warrant of our doctrine or callings: as our adversaries, iesting (but with fained chear) at this our successe, require of vs. For, a wicked and adulterous generation requireth a signe,
                  Math. 12.39. and no signe shall be given them but that of the Prophet Ionas: and, that, albeit they destroy this Temple, yet God shall raise it vp againe in three dayes.

I would aske thē, who, thus, cry after miracles, if we did work alse many, yea and in appearance, alse great miracles, as ever did Christ, and all other Prophets or Apostles: would they therefore beleeve vs; teaching any other gospel thē which is alreadie taught and written? they are worthie, indeed, whom God should give vp, in his iustice, to this grossenes, who, by false miracles and lying wonders, have seduced the world to believe lyes. Yet, I think there is none of thē that dare say so. If thē, our doctrine be new (as they stoutlie affirme) how vaine are they to require of vs miracles? when onely, this, that it is new, may sufficientlie improve it not only being destitut of miracles, but even albeit it were backed with al the wonders of the world. But if our doctrine be not new, but even that everlasting Gospell: then, their desire, prooveth them to bee a wicked &amp; adulterous generation. If anie man or Angell preach any other Gospell

then which hath beene taught and written, though hee remove mountaines,

In the verie infancie of the old Church vnder the law, when, in a smal measure of dispensation, miracles had their owne place &amp; vse: the Lord, yet, was so farre from making them the warrant of truth, as, even then, hee would have them controlled by the word of truth. Now, shame, I think, shall dryve our adversaries to say, that they requyre not miracles of vs for a warrant of doctrine: but that, seeing wee have no ordinarie vocation, of Pastours in the Church, that for maintenance of the lawfulnes of our extraordinarie calling, wee have to worke miracles. Who, of any sound mynd, can not but extreamlie wonder; how, by so manifold and childishe a cavillation, men affecting the opinion of learning and holynes, should so evidentlie make themselves ridiculous and bewray openlie an evill conscience? For, first, as I have already cleared, for our Churches, in common, they are impudent to deny our ordinarie vocation. But, to let this passe with them, if my doctrine proove it selfe to bee the truth, what place have such men as it convinced to bee

If our doctrine bee truth, their mouthes are stopped who, directlie, impugne it: and, if it bee false, what foolishnes is it to crave a warrant of our callings; as if all the miracles which ever were wrought, could warrant a man to teach lyes? Besides all this, that miracles are, alwayes requisite for iustifying an extraordinarie callinge, it is falslie assumed. For,

                dispensation, the holy Ghost, in goodly and convenient types, most fitlie expresseth, Chapter 4. and Chapter 15. of the Revelation. In the first is put a cleare Christallin Sea, with seven burning Lampes, apart. So, to designe the pure word &amp; worship according thereto, in these first tymes, accompanied with the powerfull cooperation of the holy spirit: but, in such sort, as then, there was a distinct outward and visible dispensation, and donation of the holy spirit, by imposition of hands: and kything in visible symbols of the holy spirit, and divers gifts, and miraculous operations. In the fifteene Chapter, is shewed again, that the Sea is cleare as Christall, and hath the ioyned operation of the holy spirit: but, the Sea is mingled with the fyre. To shew, in the last dispensation, for overthrow of Antichrist, a puritie of the word

and worship, &amp; the vertue of the spirit ioyned therewith, as at first: but yet so, as no dispensation of the spirit should be, but by and with the word, as mingled therewith: all outward, and visible extraordinarie donation of the spirit, and miraculous operations, now, ceassing. And verelie, an other manner was requisite for bringing in first the Gentiles to the faith, and so, casting Satan from heaven, (even that the Gospell should be miraculis inchoata) then for overturning his fraudfully reerected throne in the church vnder pretence of the Lambe his hornes: and to much different dealing for burying the Synagogue with honour, then for thrusting Antichrist to the doore with shame. At first, the Lord had to procure credit to his Gospell as to his owne sacred will &amp; word: next, again, he had by this Gospell, so now obtaining, as the partie to be detected and overthrowen thereby dare not openly denie the authoritie thereof, but to convince the traitour covered vnder false pretences.
            25. To disproove this power of plaine and prevayling truth, and, to discredit the argument of our miraculous successe thereby: our adversaries yet ryse against vs with two obiections. The first is, that, if successe and wyde obtayning were a note of truth, then also, or more iustlie, might Arrianisme and Mahometisme acclaime the title thereof, as wee. But, these instances are sophisticallie, brought against the truth and vs. For, albeit wee confesse heresie to bee verie contagious, and the word thereof to be fretting as a gangrene: through the conveniencie it hath with the vaine humour of man, who is, naturallie a lyer: yet when soever it is put to iust tryall by the truth, then can it retaine no strength. It is indeed, true, that truth alwayes prevayleth not. (for then, the mysterie of iniquitie had never attayned to such height,) but, this falleth not through the weaknes of truth, but partlie, through the vanity of men, who falling away frō the love and due regard of truth, are, in God his iustice, given vp to the efficacie of errour: Partlie, through their vniust furie,

reiecting and persecuting the truth vntryed. wherein, yet the great odds betwixt veritie and lyes, is wonderfull: in that, even in the highest degree of prevailing error (while Satan hath a throne in the verie temple of God) yet,
                  Revel. 2. even then, as, in Pergamus, the truth still dwelleth, and a number keep the name of God, even where Satan his throne is, and against the terrour of bloodshed. Whereas, on the other part, truth being but admitted to plead for it selfe, albeit the holders have little strength (as,
                  Revel. 3. in Philadelphia) yet, the adversaries are forced to come and worship at their feet. But, this we maintaine and hold, that when ever it pleaseth the Lord to send out his light and truth for leading men to his holy mountaine:
                  Revel. 11. and, that herefie, howe stronglie soever grounded, is reduced to due examination thereby: that, then, albeit it hath vsurped even the holy citie &amp; court of the tempel, yet, by the true measuring reed, it will be clearlie found to be cast out. Their argument is a deceitfull falacie by confounding of divers cases and causes: of the truth admitted to plead, and of the same, againe, after in God his iustice hid, or, by mens crueltie and vniust violence, debarred from all defence. And, this is evident, in both the alleadged instances. For, Arianisme, albeit having, for it, great (but vnsanctified) both learning and eloquence, yet was ever ashamed before the truth: till by the crueltie and violence of Easterne Emperours, in Asia, and by the Barbarous feretie of Vandall and Gothik Kings in Africk and Europe, it was inforced. and yet, neither, so, could it ever either beare downe the truth, or continue long vngone in smoke before it. As for Mahometisme, nothing bred it, but preceeding degrees of Antichristian darknes &amp; decay of light in the Church: and, with Antichrist his arysing to a heigh, it, still, increased as, which was both an effect thereof, and, in God his wrath,
                  Revel. 9. a punishment of Antichristian Idolatrie. Neither doeth ought yet still maintaine it, but ignorance of the Gospell:

both they and the Iewes doe still stumble) must be dryed vp: that, so, the way may bee prepared for the East to receave the Gospell: as, increase of Antichristian Idolatrie (the swelling of Euphrates) first alienated the one from it, and, still, holdeth the other in induration. Moreover, this instance of Mahomet, and the comparison thereof with our powerful prevailing light of truth, is ridiculous. For that Mahometisme never was advanced one foot of earth, but so farre as by sword and fyre it was set forward. Wheras the Gospell, having sword and fyre, and when sworde and fyre, even in the hands of pitilesse persecuters, yet by the patience of Saints, have fainted, having nowe, at last, privie poisonings, bloodie complots, and all the treasonable and tragicall machinations, which the Emissarie frogges of hell can hatch against it: yet, it prevaileth: and, still, shall, in despit of all opposition: till, Antichrist being vndone, these errors of Iudaisme and Mahometisme shall also vanishe at the cleare light thereof, when they shall even see him who pearsed him, and shall mourne apart for him: which great events, no doubt, are approching neere: in such strange and busie endeavour

Their other obiection, is, the manifold Sectes which have sprung vp with the revived light of the Gospell: each contrarie to other, and, all stoutlie acclayming the prerogative of truth. And, O, howe our adversaries doe heere applaud themselves, of their vnitie, and, how skoffinglie they exagitat this (as they call it) our distraction and multitude of opinions, so, as, one of them, in a faire, but faintlie fought, challenge, sent to the Ministers of Scotland: at the end of his weake wrestling, minding to finishe it with a deadlie blowe, concludeth his discourse in a good tale faire tale, forsooth, of this our diversitie: which, for the greater force, hee fetcheth from

a tippling Taverne in Germanie, seeking, belike, in Vino veritatem. But, doe not these men erre; because they know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God? yea, though they themselves bee Ministers of Satan his deceit, and men of his right hande, yet, are they not skilled to discerne his slight and malicious maner of working: Might not this, wherewith they reproach our Churches, have bene laid alse, yea and more iustlie, against the first outgoing light of the Gospell, and primitive Church raised thereby? yea, was not this, then, the common accusation thereof, in the mouthes of all ignorant and earthlie men? for that, even with the beginning and prevailing light of the Gospell,
                  Euseb. lib. 3. Ecclesiast. hist. ca. 20. &amp; libro 4. cap. 7. Sathan stirred vp such an infinite number of detestable heresies, and prodigious opinions, abhominable even to any naturall man of stayed witts, and all, vnder the name of Christianitie: that, therevpon, without more sifting or tryall, the worlde was stirred, madlie, to reiect and condemne the whole profession: and, with sword and fyre, to persecute it as a horrible Pest.
                  Luk. 11.21. When Satan brooketh all at ease, then is hee at rest: but, if a stronger then hee come in to spoile his house,
                  Revel. 12. then hee imployed might and slight. When, by the valour of Michael and his Angels, Sathan is thrust out from brooking a place in Heaven, then, commeth hee downe on earth,
                  Luk. 10.18. with great rage: then, VVoe to the inhabitants of Sea and earth. For, being, by the power of the Gospell, cast out of Heaven, and falling downe, thence, as lightning, then, seeing hee can not brooke a roome in God his house, hee, furiouslie, mistrammeth his own. When hee can not keepe downe the light of the Gospell, nor, by all his guyle and malice, obtaine, but, that precious pearle must come foorth: his next endeavour, is, to cast in, therewith, such a multitude of counterfaits, as may make the vpright pearle either hardlie to bee discerned, or then, with the rest, to be esteemed all alike false. so, to divert mens heartes from it. This their obiection, then, maketh so little against the Gospell, as,

it sheweth evidently, by this angrie busines of Satan, that he is, indeed highlie chafed. and therefore the wyse hearted ought the more diligentlie to search after that precious pearle, the manifestation whereof so breeveth him, &amp; for that true and vpright money, which hee laboureth among the mids of his counterf

Sahtan never invyeth vnitie in errour, nor zeale in a false religion. If vnitie, simply, without respect of that, wherein parties are vnited, were a note of the church, then might hell vindicate to it selfe that title.

            28. We plead ordinarie vocation for our Church, in common, and, this, because so it is, and not, for that of absolut necessitie it behooved to be so. Neither speak I thus, as partiallie caried to maintaine the credit of some particular men, whose defect, herein, (if it were any) could never preiudge our Churches. For mine owne part, as, in all sobernes and cleannes of heart, by the gift of GOD, I have beene carefull to know the truth, so, was I never much curious to inquire of the particular state of our first mens callings. Which, whether it were ordinarie or extraordinarie, and, that, whollie or partlie, in some men or in all, as it matereth litle o

but idle and childish. For, if ever any such evill and confusion did befall the church, as that, for reformation therof, any extraordinary dealing was requisit. The vsurpation of Antichrist, most of all other: as I doubt not but God, accordingly, shewed, in some, either persons workers, or works of persons or both. I approve our men who sustain our ordinarie vocation, in common, but, who plead so for it as a point absolutly requisit for approoving our cause, and in such a case of the church, doe place al defence therein: in my iudgement, they doe, wronglie limit the holy one of Israel, against both the priviledge of his power, and his vsuall manner of dealing in such cases. And, who defend our first mens callings to have bene partlie ordinarie, partlie extraordinarie (whither that some extraordinary persons were raised by GOD, or, that, ordinary persons were, by him, stirred to extraordinarie motions and actions (I think, for me, they have fallen vpon the right defence: and which is both most agreeable to GOD his honour and manner of working, and also most strong and honorable for our church and cause.

And, these, now, forsooth, are the invincible arguments, in confidence whereof, they are bold to offer, that, if wee can bee able to maintain the lawfulnes of our callings, and, that, so wee have any true Church: they will, without any more doubt or disput, about other points in controversie, joyne in communion with vs. But, certainlie, if truth bee with vs, and they, consequentlie, bee heretiks, they jangle with vs, impertinentlie of outward calling: the having whereof, as it will never justifie errour, so, neither will the defect thereof bee ever a relevant exception against truth,

When, by cleare scripture, we proove their Pope to bee Antichrist: to free him of that blot, albeit they be otherwayes extreemelie impudent and malicious, in forging false criminations, and calumnious slaunders, yet, with all the ingyne of hell finding none other, vpon whom to lay over the staine of that odious title: they are faine to refuse that hee is yet come: and, that, when hee commeth, hee shall openlie overthrow all true worshippe, and obtaine rule over the whole earth.

if, the church then shall, not only in truth and true professors, but even in all publict ensigne of profession, bee invisible: if he shal (possiblie) sit in Rome and peaceablie brook all: why (in the disput about Antichrist) are multitude, vniversalitie, personall succession, and visibilitie, still laid against vs? Why is ruinous Rome as an infallible rock opposed, for al defence, vnto vs? and why see they not, that by their owne confession, they must otherwayes vindicat their Pope from that blot; &amp; that wee have, but, to cleere, whither the Pope bee hee who was to come, or, if we must looke for another? If they would pretēd the short space of the churches defect vnder Antichrist (according to their dreame of three yeeres and an half (yet, how doth the truth of God his promise consist (as for their owne defence they interprete) if it faile but one day? or, if he may and shal, in a totallie prevayling evill, whereby, not onely truth, but also al pretence and profession of Christianitie is overthrowen, yet, preserve both his Church and promise to her, three yeares and an halfe, why might he not alse well, and vnder the vaile of permitted profession, much better, for many ages? and if vnder their imaginarie Antichrist, directlie impugning Christianitie, and advowedly exalting him selfe against GOD and Christ, whose name he shall not so much as pretend, yet, both truth and a true Church shall lurke three yeares and an halfe: how much more (vnder him, who, of a degenerating succession of ordinarie Pastours, pretending Christ his name and power, &amp;, who did not become extreamlie evill at once, but by degrees, mounted to the height of impietie, masked in a Mysterie) might the true Church, vnder the common ensigne of profession, have lyen long hidden?

It is the Pontificality which we challenge, &amp; not personallie, Pius, Leo, Paulus, or Clemens. And, to how hard shiftes our adversaries are driven in this point, it is easie to perceave: when, to pul mens minds from espying their Pope, they propone to bee exspected such an Antichrist, as, comming, could not, possiblie, in all his three yeares and a halfe, find three phrenetick fooles to be his followers. As if, foresooth, one, directlie damning all Christianitie, openlie blaspheming the name of God and Christ, and impudentlie and advowedlie, challenging to him selfe all diuine honour (in such daylie growing light of the Gospell, and settled knowledge of God) could possiblie in three yeares &amp; a halfe roote out all religion, and subdue all nations of the earth. in which space, a verie deliver single man in fulnes of bodilie strength and continuing vigour, yet were scarce able, with all possible speed, vpon a wager, to survey them.

set vpon it so faire &amp; conspectible a mark, as, either no Christians at all, shall, at that time, be in the world, or then, they may alse well know, and calcule that day, as we doe, now, Christmas. namely, having so iumpe a space of yeares and dayes, and so notable coincident cases, as the returning of.

But, it is not my purpose, here, to handle this point of matter, either for prooving their Pope to be Antichrist: or to refute these their foolishe dreames. for more full resolution whereof, and, of ought else, that from that booke may appeare here, of me to be too shortlie touched, I referre the reader to my commentarie on the revelation.
            31. The waxing light of the Gospell, dayly more &amp; more discovering the man of sin, maketh our adversaries to paint out Tragelaphos &amp; Chimeraes. wherby they may stupifie &amp; detaine foolish hearts in expectation of such an Antichrist, as shall come, I warrant you, ad grecas Calendas: some thousand yeares after the Iewes have gotten their, long, but, vainlie lookt for, Messias, But, as these shall never get another Christ then whom they pearced, so, neither shall the others, any Antichrist, but whom they follow. The Iewes, in God his mercie, shall, yet see their true Messias, and mourne for him: Our characterized adversaries shall follow, still, blindlings, their Abaddon, to the lake of fire and brimstone, &amp; waile, then, with him. And, they are so anxiously carefull of their credit herein, that, for holding, still, simple mindes in a maze, least, longing, perhaps, they should looke more nearly, and so, with setled senses, espy the Dragon his mouth vnder semblance of the Lamb his hornes: some surmise, for intertaining exspectation, (of one, never to come) must be brought, nowe and then, from the East: of som dumb Devil borne at Babylon, and begotten, forsooth, betwix some feind or farie, and a devised Daniel, who hath I warrant you, two thousand years agoe, lost all the writings of his genealogie. It is not so strange, that these men, whose filthines &amp; shame, the glorious light of the Gospel hath so farre detected, that, now they see no remedie, but, desperatly to passe all bounds of shame, should therfore,

so impudentlie delude the Worlde, with such foolishe fantasies. but, it is both wonder and pitie, in so cleare light of truth, that, still, so many should be abused with them. a iust punishment of the careles misregarde of that light which is come in the worlde; but the worlde loveth darknes more then light. And howsoever some of the Auncients, whose tymes &amp; perception were farre remooved from the knowledge of these mysteries, in a slender and careles consideration of them, did fall vpon some points of these fonde speculations: yet, nowe, when not only knowledge is, with course of time, increased, but also the eventes have made things cleare: it is not only a maigre defence, but, bewraying, also, evidentlie, perversenes of mindes, and guiltines of conscience, to runne to such doting dreames, and ridiculous raveries, as, albeit they were not refelled by cleare Scripture, yet, were fitter to bee an addition to Rables, or to make vp the last booke of Amades de Gaule, then to bee reputed profound pointes of Christian wisedome.
            32. Thus have I shortlie answered the maine obiections of our adversaries, which, as, an vnresistable ordinance, they proudlie plant against our callinges and Church: and, finding nowe, their batterie directed, speciallie, against that quarter, wherein our Lord and Captaine hath assigned mee a station in his service (for that, by reason of our weak fortification, and their great inwarde intelligence, they conceave great hope of an easie surpryse on that part:) I have, as becommeth, albeit a weake, yet a faithfull souldier, hasted to the breach, with such armes as came to hand. That, if, perhappes, the courage of our weake once hath beene, in any degree, dismayed, with the terrour of this recent alarme, yet, finding the ennemie effronted, their heartes may bee, thereupon, so farre stayed, as to stande and perceave, that all this supercilious shewe of a fierce assault, is but a vaine, and weakly backed bravado. which, to offer vs with a newe and high morgue, our adversaries have newlie bene animated, by their late supplement of fresh
                  •
                forces from beyond sea. who, &amp; their cuilliers, what

disposition they are of, is evident by this, that they are puffed vp, and made more insolent, with that, which, iustlie, hath dumped in a deep sorrow, all true hearts of both the Ilands. and the daylie surmises, from them, of yet, moe doolfull events, with the cursed hope whereof, they can not dissemble but they are tickled: (albeit, all praise to God, yet found false, &amp; we hope in the Lord, shall stil prove) yet, they clearlie shewe, either what plottes they are on: or, with what plotters they have intelligence: or, what practises, perniciously performed, would chiefly chear their poisonable minds.
            And, now, howsoever I be in a weake guerison, not the strongest of all, yet so stronge is the truth, and that Lord, in whose strength, and whose cause I plead: as I hope that, even heereby the deceit and imbecillitie of these their obiections are so clearelie discovered, that the judicious and free hearted Reader, shall remayne satisfied: and, even our simple once hearts strengthened against our adversaries high boasting. To men of corrupt minds nothing is enough. Neither is our labour for any either ecclesiasticke or (as they terme them) lay persons, of that Antichristian body, which have receaved the beast his character, and are not reclaimable: who, deceaving, and being deceaved, waxe worse &amp; worse: and, compassing sea and earth, and with lying and murthering (to vphold their tottring kingdome) madlie mixing all, doe evidentlie bewray, what spirit they are of. but, they shall prevaile no longer, for their madnes shall be manifest vnto all men. As for such, whether ecclesiastike or lay persons, among them, who are, in simplicitie of heart, and blind zeale miscaried, having but the name or number, but not the character of the beast: we both pittie them and pray for them, that the Lord would open their eyes and put in their hearts to come out of Babylon, least they be partakers of her iudgements. for, her plagues shall come in one day. even the Lord will cut of all lying lippes and the toung that speaketh proud things.
            
         
         
            
            TO A RECVSANT, FOR CLEARING AND MAINTAINING SOME POINTS IN THE PRECEEDING TREATISE, challenged by a Roman Elymas, Bar-Iesus-it.
            
            
               RECOVERING, some dayes since, a copy of my Treatise in defence of our callings, which had fallen in your handes some moneths agoe: I perceaved that it had passed the examination and censure of some one of your ghostlie Fathers: (if I misdeeme not) even the same, whose pamphlet against our callings stirred me to the defence of them, yet so, as, amids divers dumbe draughts of a silent Aristarchus, there is but one onely open challenge through all. Which (while he is perhaps, a breeding of a bigger birth) his weak heart could not keep, til, with the rest, it should be timely borne: thinking, belike he had, theirin, so cleare an advantage over me, as, vpon that place, he might be bold to put out some speach: thus to intertaine his applauders in hope that hee had also much to say against the rest. But, if this his glorying Goliath, so confidently stepping out single shal be easilie foiled, it may well be presumed, that, with noe great a doe, the rest of his dumbe Host may be made both to flee and fall.
            Over a place; in my Treatise, he setteth this signe, ✚. and therewithal, this saying, agree this and the other places that is marked with this signe. My wordes, first signed by him, are

these. And the Lord his wyse providence for preserving thus his church in the mids of Antichristian vsurpation (while hee appeared to possesse all) was wonderfull: in that, even in time of greatest corruption, yet asure accesse and free way was still reserved through Citie and Court, to the Temple, the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance, remaining; and the doctrine of the Trinitie being keeped sound. Sect. 7. The places, thereafter, signed with the same signe, and, in the challenger his conceat, contradicting this, are two: and these both, Sect. 10. the first in these wordes. Yea wee are so farre from this disorder, &amp; do so farre both reverence and maintain ordinarie vocation, that in a constitute Church holding the foundation (albeit, otherwayes, divers things therein, not only for maners but also for maner of worshippe, did require reformation) if any man of howe great gifts soever, yet, without ordinarie calling should intrude himselfe to be a Pastour: we would no otherwayes account of him then of a seditious and turbulent Spirit, who, either, fanatikly, presuming of graces, would vainlie despyse order: or, for some infirmities and defects, would arrogantly and vncharitably breake the vnitie of the Church.
            
            Now, that I may the more clearly recōcile any apparant repugnācy betwixt these places, I wil, first, set down, (as I can take it) the challenger his conceaved cōtradictiō, thus,

                  VVho in a constitute Church holding the foundatiō, &amp;c. would intrude himselfe, without ordinary calling, to be a Pastour, is to be accounted a seditious &amp; turbulent despyser of ordre, and an arrogant and vncharitable renter of Church vnitie.
               
            
            But the Christian Church, since her first constitution, alwayes, even in time of greatest corruption, hath holden the foundation.

                  Therfore, who at any time, without ordinary vocation intruded himselfe to be a Pastour therein, he was but a sedicious and turbulent despyser of order, and an arrogant and vncharitable renter of Church vnitie.
               
            
            I wil not, here, dallie vpon these words (intrude himselfe) which in no case can ever be lawfull, and may never bee iustly said of any who is truely, albeit, extraordinarlie, sent out by God. I come to the argument. The proposition of the sillogisme is mine owne, &amp; I can not disadvow it. The

assumption (that we iangle not about the state of our question) must be cleared from equivocation. for, no question, but the true Church elected according to the purpose of grace, hath alwayes, and ever shall holde the foundation, without which shee could be no true Church at all. But, from the true Church and elect, to the visible Church, the argument concludeth not. Next againe, albeit, in a right sense, it be true of the visible Church, that she ever holdeth the foundation: because within the compasse of the visible Church the true militant Church abydeth alwayes, as vnder the common ensigne: yet, hereupon, to conclude, that, alwayes, visibly, &amp; the visible Church, tota communiter (whole in common) doth hold the foundation, it is a seene fallacie. for, she may fall from the foundation tota communiter (the whole in common) but, never vniversaliter singuli in ea (vniversally each one within her.) And howesoever mine adversarie will not yeeld me this point, yet hee can not but condescend, that this is, here, the state of our question: whither I have, in my first signed wordes graunted so much, as will cōclude cleerly against my selfe that even the visible Church, &amp; whole in common, ever holdeth the foundation. which is the assumption of this syllogisme: &amp; which he thinketh to prove out of mine own words, thus:

                  VVhere the Sacrament of Baptisme in substance, remaineth, and doctrine of the Trinitie is keeped, sound, that Church holdeth the foundation.
               
            
            But, in the Church, alwayes, even in time of greatest corruption, the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance, remained, &amp; the doctrine of the Trinitie was keeped sound.

                  Therfore, the Church alwayes, even in time of greatest corruption, held the foundation. and, consequently, no place was at any time in her, since her first constitution, to extraordinarie calling. VVhich is contrarie to my position.
               
            
            The proposition hath an equivocation: which to discover, and, so, to avoid the deceit intended thereby, I distinguishe thus. If by the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance, bee vnderstoode all the substantiall matter by Baptisme

represented to our knowledge, sealed vp through faith in our conscience, and, all the grace thereby, through the cooperation of the holy Ghost, conferred to vs: and, if by the doctrine of the Trinitie, be vnderstood whatsoever we are taught and doe beleeve of that triple one, either in himself or his dispensation towards vs, and our duetie againe to him: in that sense, I yeeld the proposition to be true. But, if by the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance, remaining, be vnderstood only the sacramental action in the substantiall rites thereof, so making it still to bee counted lawfull baptisme in substance, albeit otherwayes, miserablie infected with many superfluous and superstitious ceremonies: and, if by the doctrine of the Trinitie, no more be vnderstood but that only one point of God one in substance and three in persons: without which, and the solemne invocation thereof in baptisme, even the substance of that Sacrament were abolished: then the proposition is clearlie false. And the proponer would but illude in the words Substance and Doctrine. except hee will affirme, that, for the foundation of our faith, no more were requisite but these only two points. And thus, (outtaking Samosatenus, Sabellius, Arrius, and Manes, and such others as, either before or after them, vnder whatsoever divers names, symbolized with their particular errours) all heretikes of whatsoever sect or tyme shalbe reputed to have holden the foundation. So shall Nestorius, Eutiches, and Appollinaris bee absolved from fundamentall errours: so shall the denyers of the resurrection: so shall the followers of spirits of errours, and teaching doctrines of devills: so shall the Nicolaitans teaching and committing fornication and idolatrie, have kept the foundation. Shall not the incarnation of the aeternall Sonne; the personall vnion of the assumer and assumed; the naturall veritie of both natures in that one person; bee counted foundamentall? Shall not the onely mediation and merit of that Person; his Propheticall, Priestlie, and Royal offices, and actions thereof; the perfection, efficacy, and vertue of all, be counted foundamentall? Or shall the

bare holding of GOD one in substance and three in persons bee any foundation at al to such as in the other points doe overthrow it? It is strange that one acknowledging that the baptized by heretiks are not to bee rebaptized, &amp;, consequently, acknowledging the baptisme ministred by them, to be baptisme in substance: which yet it could not be without the invocation of the Trinitie: should yet, vpō baptisme remayning in substance, and that one point of the trinitie of persons thinke the foundation to be keeped, when not onely open perverters and direct oppugners of foundamentall points, but also adders of anie other to that only one foundation (by the Apostle his sentence) doe even fall from the foundation which, otherwayes, they would appeare both to professe and keepe. The Sacrament of Baptisme and sounde doctrine of the Trinitie still kept in the visible Church, and even in tota communiter, was ever a sure and free entrie, and, as Augustin speaketh, opportunum inquirendi exordium (a common and convenient beginning to inquire by: but yet so, as who, thereby entring, held the straight course to the Temple, where were the Candlestickes and the Olives, and to mount Sion, where was the Lambe: These, indeed, held the foundation, and the gates of hell never prevayled against them. But, who entring by that common entrie, declyned from the right way leading to the Temple and mount Sion: and, did fall aside vpon, and rest in the common pollution of Citie and Court: following, wondering after, and worshipping the Beast and the Dragon (even that abhomination of desolation, standing also within the visible Church, in Sanctis Ecclesiae locis, as sayeth Chrisostome,) these fell so from the foundation, as, even that which to the others was the entrie and faire way to the Temple and Mountaine, was to them of no more value, then if they had never entered at all. For that, in missing of the rest, they loosed even that also, which otherwayes they appeared to have, as, in the foundation of a large Citie, who raiseth so the building as hee keepeth but one

stone of all, must of necessity even fall from that also: and bee no otherwayes said to hold the foundation then Saul pleaded that hee had fulfilled the commandement of the Lord, which, notwithstanding, the Prophet affirmed hee had casten away, and, therefore was justly cast away of the Lord from being king of Israel. Thus, then the proposition of his argument being evidently false, his conclusion also faileth, and my two places doe well and clearly consist. And, considering how we doe charge the Church of Rome with intollerable prevarications, almost, in all fundamentall points (against that one GOD, in giving his glorie to creatures: against the verity of Christ his humane nature by their prodigious transubstantiation: against al his mediation, offices, and actions thereof, by many fold and sacrilegious derogation, vsurpation, mutilation, and overthrow of all the perfection, fruit, force, and effect thereof) so as the censurer cannot dissemble the cleare knowledge of my meaning in granting them the Sacrament of Baptisme in substance, and sound doctrine of the Trinitie; in this consideration (I say) how can his challenge of contradiction, in my wordes, bee excused of either childish triffling, or shameles cavillation; or both?
            Now, albeit what I have already said, aboundantlie serveth for reconciliation of the other place signed also by my censurer, yet let vs see what is the contradiction hee would inferre thereupon. My wordes, and continuallie, following the former, are these: But if corruption hath so farre prevailed that the faithfull City hath become an harlot, and all her silver be turned in drosse: if her husbandmen have become murtherers and her builders have become destroyers: if from the Prophet even to the Priest everie one followeth after lyes: if there be a conspiracie of her Prophets in the mids of her like a roaring Lyon ravening the pray: if her watchmen be all blind and know nothing: if they be all dumb doggs and can not barke: if they lye and sleepe, and love to sleepe: if her Pastours know nothing nor vnderstand, and looke whollie to their owne wayes: if night bee to them for a vision, and darknes for a divination: in such a case, &amp;c.
            
            
               Now, to commit my selfe, with my selfe, he would, appearantly, reason thus:

                  Extraordinary vocation (by my owne position) hath only place in such a corrupt state and case of a Church, as that the faithfull City hath become a harlot, and all her sylver is turned in drosse: her husbādmen are become murtherers, etc.
               
            
            But, the case of the Christian Church even in tyme of greatest corruption was never such.

                  Therefore, by myne owne position, no place, was in her, at any tyme for extraordinarie calling. And, so, I am contradictour to my selfe.
               
            
            The Proposition is mine owne. The Assumption (of the visible Church) is false. And hee seeketh to succour it from my Position thus:

                  Of a Church keeping the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance and sound doctrine of the Trinitie, no such case, as I have put, can be truely affirmed.
               
            
            But, by mine owne position, the Church, even in tyme of greatest corruption, hath keeped the Sacrament of Baptisme in substance, and sound doctrine of the Trinitie.

                  Therefore, of the Church, at no tyme, such a case could bee truely affirmed. And consequently, no tyme ever for extraordinarie calling. VVhich, by mine owne Position, hath only place in such a case.
               
            
            The aequivocation of the Proposition, I cleared in my answere to his first conceaved contradiction. Now, in the sense, ther, shewed to be mine, a church, holding only these points, albeit shee erre in, yea and overthrow most part of all other foundamentall grounds, and, consequently, even these same which she seemeth to hold, also: that, notwithstanding, the holding, barely, of these, may vindicat her from the blame of my proponed case, I even muse if my challenger will affirme it. And, that (taking hold, perhaps, on the peremptorie and precise strictnes of the wordes) he would, thus, reason: that where but even so much is holdē as I have yeelded, &amp; even in the sense I have called myne, there, all cannot bee turned in drosse, neither can Pastours,

there, be said to know nor vnderstand nothing, &amp;c. and consequentlie, that no such case, as I have put, hath ever be fallen, I will hardlie be induced to beleeve, or that a man of any sense or shamefastnes will bewray himselfe to be so ridiculous a jangler. Wherein yet he should not contend with me, but with the Lord, whose the wordes are, and not mine: and who chargeth therewith a Church holding more of the foundation, then ever we will grant to the Church of Rome: who, in the abhominations she doth commit, hath iustified the Church of Iuda, of whom the Lord affirmed my proponed case: and, which, therefore, more iustlie, a great deale, might have alledged against the precise strictnes of the Lord his accusatiō. They held the Sacrament of circumcision, the name of the God of Israell, the outwarde profession of his Covenant and worshippe; and the publike practise thereof in dayly sacrifices &amp; oblations. And, had they place, herefore, to plead, that all their silver was not turned in drosse? The Lord, in challenging our defections, whē the substantial groūds are most parte subverted, hee pleadeth a totall apostasie. His owne Bellarmine, telling howe, iudiciouslie, to reade and make right vse of the sayings of the Fathers, might have taught your man, that in Homilies to the people, where, in vehement contestations, speaches are, of purpose, framed, rhetorically, and hyperbolically to force of perswasion, for sturring motion, and for agreaging and amplification: they are, then, to be wyselie distinguished from a scholastike and more presse and proper maner in laying down foundamental points: and, that they are not to be alike or indifferentlie drawn for stablishing or prooving heads of faith, in the praecise strictnes and proprietie of wordes. for, one and the same man will have a much different maner of stile in homilizing and in dogmatizing. Not that, therefore, the Fathers, and much lesse, the Lord (who though all men were lyers, yet abydeth true) did say 
                  〈◊〉
                then truth. But that from a figurative, rhetoricall, &amp; hyperbolike truth, to conclude a truth, in praecise

strictnes of proper signification, it is either foolishe ignorance, or perverse tergiv

               rsation. And, to shorten all disput, herein; I would aske your ghostly Father; so beeing that all, wherewith we do charge the Church of Rome, &amp; wherupon they with vs and we with them have nowe, so many yeares contested, and doe contest stil, were verified against her; if, in that case, she could bee denyed to be the very Synagogue of Satan? and, that the case, proponed by me, might not be as iustlie said of her, as hee dare not deny but it was obiected to Iuda: except hee would belye the almightie? Nowe, whither wee charge her rightly or not; in our disput here, it were impertinent, and a slyding from the cause in hand, either for him to pleade the one, or me to proove the other: the question, here, betwixt vs, standing so, as I having laid this ground, that in a condition of a corrupted Church, (and such as I proponed) extraordinarie vocation may have place. and, againe, pleading, that the condition of the Church, in common, at the beginning of our reformation, was such: whither, if, by yeelding her, still, and, even then, the Sacrament of Baptisme in substance, and sound Doctrine of the Trinitie, I have admitted ought which contradicteth mine own positions. which to evince against 
                  〈◊〉
               , I thinke it must cost your Confessour some more paines, then, but in passing by only to point at it. This his proposition beeing false, hee concludeth nothing, and my places doe yet well consist.

Christian to receave the Sacraments from a rēprobat, beeing, alwayes, an ordinary Minister? which Sacraments, yet, by the inward cooperation of God, are effectuall to the receaver for, it is sufficient for an outward ordinary calling that the Minister thereof have outward place &amp; power of ordination, albeit he be but a Hyreling and a Thiefe. And, the receaver of outward ordinary vocation, as he hath all gift and grace from God only, whose the worke is, so is he not tyed or sworne to the will or appetit of the outward Minister, but only to the Lord: no more then any Minister, Baptizeth in his owne name, but in the Lord his, whose badge and cognissance only we take on, thereby, and not of the Minister thereof, &amp;c. I will not thinke my remarker so remarkeably grosse, as that he thinketh the efficacie of the Sacraments to depend on the worthines or vnworthines of the Minister thereof. for, in the contrary of this, I hope wee doe both agree. and, againe, that he, who holdeth ordination to be a Sacrament no lesse then any of the other, wil deny the same common case of it also, I have no reason to imagine: Neither yet, for my similitude, taken from the common condition of Sacraments, that therefore, hee would think me to make ordination also a Sacrament (with him) in the most strict and proper signification. for, the similitude of things, in some cases, maketh not things, alwayes, to be the same. and, thus farre, I hope wee shall accord in the truth and convenience of my similitude: that, as the Minister of Sacraments (having still outward place and power) neither conferreth inward grace, for any worthines in him, neither letteth the collation thereof through his vnworthines, so, neither doth the vnworthines of the ordainer (having 
                  〈◊〉
                place and power of ordination) let the effectual

               escending from above from the Father of lights. For, there is but one Lord who hath led captivitie captive, &amp; giveth gifts to men: my adversarie wil confesse this also, that frō what Bishop soever the Sacraments may be receaved (except Baptisme, which, in honour of Christ, forsooth, he relegateth not only to Woemen but even to Iewes and Turkes) from the same Bishop ordination, may

be receaved also. but, as I can scanse at his meaning, hee thinketh my errour to be, in this remarkeable: that, to him, I appeare to make it all one thing or alike to receave the Sacraments or ordination from a Wolfe or Thiefe, as to rereave them from a hyreling or reprobate. which, if I did, absolutly, hold, and did accordingly, reason, from the one to the other: it were, indeed, a manifest halting in Logike, and therewith, no sounde point of Divinitie also. The course of my argumentation, in my treatise, is so at length and evidently led, and my cases so clearly put, as, I am sure, no vpright hearted Reader could ever have fallen vpon so sinistrous a conception. but, it is the maner of men, who read only to resist, to snatch at syllables, and wrest parcels of mens speaches so to maintaine iangling. And seeing that my remarker, albeit hee hath busied himselfe most, yea, and almost, only on the 6.7. and 8. sections of my Treatise (as his tokens left thereupon well shewe) yet even there hath vnderstood least, and, either hath not conceaved, or deceitfully dissembled my meaning: I will, therefore, heere, summarily resume the substance of my matter, and drift of my discourse there.
            Vpon the prerogative of the Bishop of Rome, a long tyme reputed head of the Churche, and all ordinarie vocation flowing (in that respect,) either mediatlie or immediatly from him, our adversaries labour to inferre against vs, that either we have never had any lawful ordination at all, or then have fallen from it. Because, that the Bishop of Rome was, then when our ordination flowed from him, either the Antichrist (as wee affirme) and, consequentlie, beeing a Wolfe and Thiefe, could have no power of ordination: or then a lawfull Pastour holding truth: in which case, wee falling from his communion, have fallen from the truth, and all lawfull vocation also. against this (to shew howe, in that, which, in the pamphlet that came to my hands, was inscribed the invincible argument, there is no more vigour then in a roape of a rotten rushe) I laid down this contrary position.

That our outward ordinarie callings did, in a sort, flow from the Bishop of Rome, without any discredit or derogation to the dignity or lawfulnes of them: notwithstanding that he is that verie Antichrist and man of sinne: and, so, not onely a Wolfe and Thiefe, but even of al other the most execrable. The summe of that argument, whereby to inferre this my Position, and which, at large, I did set downe in my treatise, and the mentioned sections thereof, is this.

                  From a VVolfe or Thiefe, who, descending in an ordinary succession from good and lawfull Pastours at first, and who degenereth not at once, but by long and slow degrees, and, that, not, as an open outward enemy directly oppugning the ensigne, but, still, pretending Christ his power and service, and, covertly, by pretence of the ensigne, deceaving: before he be detected and knowen to be a Traitour, VVolfe, &amp; Thiefe, and, so, retaining still, with all, in common, the account and place of a lawfull Pastour: lawfull ordination may flow: and the ordained by him, taking ordination vprightly as from a lawful Pastour &amp; reputed so still, in common, not knowing nor beeing partakers of his treason, may even, so, have lawfull outward vocation: and, falling from their ordainer, eftsoones detected to bee a VVolfe and Thiefe, yet stil retain the prerogative of their callings.
               
            
            But, such a Traitour, Wolfe, &amp; Thiefe was the Bishop of Rome, what tyme our ordination, in a sort, did flow from him; before it was said to the revived witnesses, come vp hither, Revel. 11. &amp; he proclaimed a Traitour 14.8. and al, thereupon, interdicted his worshippe, and character 14.9.

                  Therefore from the Bishop of Rome, our outward callings, in a sort, might flow: and, wee shrinking from him (now declaired Traitour) yet still retaine the prerogative and priviledge of our callings.
               
            
            In the tenour and drift of this argument (that divers points &amp; cases be not ignorantly or deceitfully confounded, either to the obscuring or perverting of my meaning) two things are, heedfully, to be eied, and the distinct considerations

of them. First, my Positions: and, th
                  •
               se distinctlie, als well the speciall and definit position which I take to proove, as the generall and indefinit which I bring for a mids or argument to inferre the other. And, secondly, the restrict cases of both. The speciall definit position, which I take to proove, is the conclusion of my sillogisme. The generall and indefinit, whereby I conclude it, is the Proposition thereof: the restrict case of my speciall and definit position is, that, I affirmed not our callings to have flowed from the Bishop of Rome, absolutly, but, in a sort. The restrict case of my generall and indefinit position, is, that I affirmed not lawfull ordination might be taken of a Wolfe or Thiefe, absolutly, but from such a Wolfe &amp; Thiefe as in my Proposition is set downe at length, and in my treatise, more amply. Now, who either doth confound my positions, or draweth them frō my restrict cases to absolut assertions, he wrongeth me, therein, greatly. And to cleare this. In the restrict case of my speciall and definit position, that I affirmed our callings to have flowed frō the Bishop of Rome, in a sort, it hath two considerations to be wel adverted. First, that the Bishop of Rome was not the proper, particular, &amp; personal minister of their ordination (at least in common) howsoever in a sort or mediatly, it did flow from him. Secondly, that even this in a sort or mediatly, must not be so vnderstood as if the particular, proper, and personall ordainers had done it but as the Bishop of Rome his deputies or procurators: but, as having also themselves properly place &amp; power of ordination. Wherein, (by your adversaries doctrine) the Bishop of Rome might well have the first place and highest power: but, not the only place or onely power. For, giving him this that he were, not only, primae sedis Episcopus (in which degree the Fathers would faine have stayed his vsurpation, and yet by canons of counsels, could not) but, (which was, then, interdicted) that he were also primus Episcopus: yet was hee never sole Bishop. And, though hee got at length, (by prevailing iniquity) cheefe place &amp; power of ordination, yet never only place. For, if

hee onely were properly to bee held a Bishop, and, if ordination were only proper to him, then could not he him selfe be any Bishop at all. For none can be a Bishop without lawfull ordination: and none can or may ordaine him selfe. Neither can any other ordaine him by any power flowing from his predecessour, quia mort
                     ••
                   mandatore expirat mandatum. And, as Grogorie Bishop of Rome doth inferre, if he were sole Bishop, then, vniversa Ecclesia corruit vbi ille vniversus cadit, (he falling, the vniversal church should faile also.) And, how hardly the said Grogory did esteeme of any such vsurpation, these words doe shew. Triste valde est patiēter ferre vt omnibus despectis, frater &amp; coepiscopus noster solus nominetur Episcopus. (It is a heavy and hard matter to beare that our brother and fellow Bishop should be called onely Bishop) and he giveth the reason in another place. Quia si vnus Patriarcha vniversalis dicitur, Patriarcharum nomen caeteris derogatur, for if one be called vniversal Patriarch, the name of Patriarch is taken from the rest) so, then, is ordination of all Churchmen flowing in a sort frō the Pope, to be vnderstood: not, that either hee was the personall minister of all, or that hee had sole power of ordination: but, because he was acknowledged first in that power: and, for that, in the outward order, policy, and forme of church governement, al did acknowledge their subiection to him. Now, for that ordination is graunted to flow from him in this sort, therefore, vpon the conviction of him to be a Wolfe &amp; Thiefe; shal al ordination in the church, particularly, properly, and personallie ministred by whatsoever other Bishops, be vnlawfull? Or, shal he (convinced to be a Thiefe and Traitour) necessarily involve al other pastours of the church in the same guiltines with him, because their ordinatiō hath, in a sort, flowed from him? This were indeed, to admit that, which even a Bishop of Rome counted an execrable absurdity, quod vniversa Ecclesia corruit vbi ille vniversus cadit. your man might have learned from his owne Bellarmin (by force of truth driven thereto at last) that, though the Pope should become an heretike, yet should not the church therefore fail, or fall from

truth. We wil never yeeld him this, that at any time in the church, vniversally all and singularly each pastour, or ordainers of pastours were Wolves and Thieves, albeit wee affirme that he from whom al ordinatiō, in a sort, did flow, was, long agoe, a Wolfe and Thiefe. Now, then, I having, in the special and definit position of our callings flowing from the Bishop of Rome, put this restrict case, that they flowed from him in a sort: hee should greatly wrong me &amp; sophistically also reason, who would make this all one thing, as if I had granted them to have flowed from him particularly, as the proper &amp; personal minister thereof: or, from the Wolvish &amp; Thievish condition of him frō whom they but flowed in a sort, would conclude of all and everie particular, proper, and personal ordainers: or if hee should reason from ordinatiō, as it floweth in a sort, to ordination properly and personally proceeding. My remarker might indeed have made me remarkeably forgetfull of my selfe &amp; truth both, if in my answere to their first obiection (sect. 5.) not admitting them therfore, any iust claime in the title of the true church, for that we, forsooth, could have no orditnary vocation but with &amp; amongst thē (who, howsoever they were in the church &amp; even bore sway and obtained in tota communiter, yet were but a part in the church, and no true part of it: in that, alwayes, within the church also were true both pastours and professours) if now (I say) I should againe confesse that all our pastours ordination had flowed properly and personally from the detestable head of all that mischiefe. Which were not onely a manifest lie but an absurde impossibilitie also. If any heere, would oppone, that this my distinction is vaine, and, that it freeth vs nothing more to have had our ordination but in a sort from the Bishop of Rome, and properlie and personally from others, then if we graunted the having it of him even particularly, properly, &amp; personally: because all others particular and personal ordainers whatsoever, were not onely in outward order of Church governement subiect to the Pope of Rome: but also agreed all in one and the same faith

and doctrine with him, approving both his opinion and power: and, moreover, had all of them, or their ordainers or the ordainers of their ordainers, &amp;c. their ordination even properly and personally of the Bishop of Rome. In which respects, neither could the personall ordainers bee free of any imputation laid by vs against the Bishop of Rome, neither yee ordination from them be any better to the ordained by them, then if it had properly and personally proceeded from him, as the particular Minister therof I answer that in this allegation, is a manifold sophistication. First, as I have already shewed, from common subiection in the obtaining state of Church policie, to conclude Vnitie in opinion and all points of faith: and, from the overruling Pope, or Metropolitan his corruption and guiltines, to conclude the same of al, who by the course of the time, and prevailing lawes of Church governement are, ordinarilie subiect to him, it is, even in common experience, ridiculous, and, albeit of all, in common, it might, perhaps, be said, yet never of vniversally each one: as, in my treatise, I have shewed at length, &amp;, in my commentarie on the Revelation, more plainly. Secondly, he 
                  •••
               ld thus conclude from toleration to approbation, most falsly. For many did tolerate the evils and vsurpation which they never approoved but even detested and lamented: as did the Church in Pergamus, dwelling even where Satan his throne was: and the Church of Thyatira, where Ie
                     ••
                  abel vnder proud pretence of propheticall authoritie, impudently domined. Against which Churches, howsoever the Lord had some thing, for that their weaknes: yet, were they, no the lesse his true Churches: and, as taxed for toleration of the obtaining &amp; proudly borne out evill amongst them: so on the other part even praised for keeping the name of God, and for increase of workes, even there, where Satan his throne was, and Fornication and Idolatrie craftilie and proudly set forwarde: which, yet, and the (first) subtill, and (nixt) proud and cruell vsurpation of the committers, teachers, and imposers therof,

they had not the either knowledge or courage to challenge, directly, in the tyme. And, in these two Churches, the holy Ghost, in a depth of wisdome, and purposelie, setteth downe the type of the cōdition of his true church first and last in the mids of Antichrist his vsurpation, &amp; all the tyme within his compas. Thirdly, in alledging that al having place &amp; power of ordinatiō, or then their ordainers, or, at least, the ordainers of their ordainers, &amp;c. have receaved ordination even personally and particularly from the Bishop of Rome: besydes that, for many ages after Christ no such vsurpatiō was knowen or had place in the Church: &amp; that even after the first proud acclayming thereof many churches stood long out &amp; refused the yoak: in reasoning even from the stare of the prevailing tyrāny since the time it tooke place, there is a double fallacy. First, in not distinguishing betwixt any one particular Bishop of Rome, and the Bishop of Rome in succession of seat. And, next confounding the different and much divers consideration of distinct times, and of an evill, in time, waxing, and by degrees, arrysing from not so intollerable beginnings at first, to the height, at last, of al detestable mischief and importable impiety. If any should affirme the personall and proper ordination of all ordainers, or, of their ordainers, or at least, of the ordainers of their ordainers, &amp;c. of any one particular Bishop of Rome, hee were senseles. If, of, the seat: then the answere is easie: that none shall ever be able to shew it so possibly personall, in that sort, throw all the visible Church: but, that, in a succession of many Bishops, and these (singularly) almost all, of short aboade; and litle painfull in the personal actions of their calling, &amp;, in the progres (as I have said) of a waxing evil: we may easely and clearely evince not onely a probable but even a plaine possibility of preserving and reducing vpward lawfull ordination in the Church (at least in freedome from all personall contagion of that pestilent seat) to some more tolerable times &amp; a lesse corrupted state of a church.
            Thus have I cleared the speciall and definit position

of our outward ordinarie callings flowing from the Bishop of Rome, and restrict case thereof. Which position, as it was the conclusion of my syllogisme, and al that I either affirmed or tooke to proove of them: so will I never grant the Bishop of Rome any furder interest in them. And, thus, the flowing of our vocation in a sort from him (even confessed to be and to have then bene the very Antichrist) derogateth so litle either to the dignity or lawfulnes of thē: as, though it were granted that not only not from him, but even from no Wolfe or Thiefe any proper or personall ordination might be lawfully receaved, yet our ordination, and flowing, in a sort, from the Bishop of Rome (the Antichrist) may bee well sustained to bee lawfull. Neither am I thus precise in the special case of our ordination, because I think my selfe so straited (in granting even personall and particularly ministred ordination by a Wolfe and Thiefe, in some case to bee lawfull) as that therefore I would narrowly seeke out this evasion: but, because it were foolishe prevarication to staine the honour of our vocation more then is necessarie, by yeelding any furder place therein to Antichrist his contagion, then the nature of the case and truth of story enforceth: for, as in the Church, alwayes, even in most miserable tymes, have beene some (albeit few) lawfull and true pastours, so, consequently, alwayes, some remnant also of lawfull ordination. And, I pray you, with or amongst whom could it possibly remaine; but these, who were, first, the Candelstikes and Olives (ministers of light and grace) while no possibilitie appeared of any: and, for applying the right rodde of examination whereby Citie and Court were found to bee cast out, were next cruellie murthered: and yet Thirdly, in vigour standing vp against Antichrist, were at last separated so from his contagion, as thencefoorth Babylon falleth, and they beare away the name of heaven, the true church? Now then, howsoever, in the special case of our ordinarie vocations, and in facto, (as Iuristes speak) I will yeeld no more then my position thereof beareth:

yet, in jure, I have not forgotten what my generall and indefinit position speaketh: neither mynde I so to slyde from it. But, as I brought it for my argument, whereby as from the more to the lesse, to inferre my speciall position: so will I, now, come close to your man his hande: and although no necessitie of maintayning our callings cōstraine me thereto, yet, for cutting from him of all matter of cavillation, even graunt this also to be my position.
            That from a Wolfe and Thiefe (such as my proposition proporteth) lawfull Ordination may bee even properlie and personallie taken as from the particular minister thereof. And, (to bee yet more indulgent to my Remarker then hee, perhaps, exspecteth) that, in that case, it might even so have beene taken from the Bishop of Rome also. Whereupon, if my Remarker marketh mee as holding that Ordination may bee lawfullie ministred by, or taken from a Wolfe or a Thiefe, absolutelie, hee hath taken his markes by the Moone, or then by his owne imaginations: whereto my wordes will never affoorde him any ground. For, besides all that, which the tenour of my Discourse, on that parte, did clearlie expose to anie not wilfullie wincking even over against his [REMARK] was put the restriction of a Wolfe, Retayning ordinarie place and power of Ordination. If there he had thought, that these two can not consist: to bee a Wolfe and a Thiefe, and yet to retayne place and power of ordination, from which, even thereby, hee doeth fall: yet, he might have remembred to distinguish betwixt a Thiefe without, and a Thiefe within. And againe, of inward Theeves, betwixt a Thiefe detected, notore, noted, and proclaimed to be a Thiefe, and a Thiefe still covered vnder false pretences, and, so, retayning with all in common the reputation, if not of a true or faithfull, yet of a lawfull Pastour. Hee should not separate my position from the restrict case thereof. For, as calling is double, outwarde, and inwarde, and, a man may have the inwarde calling (by a convenient measure of gifte, and a Divine motion to consecrate

it to the giver) who hath not yet gotten outward ordination: and, againe, one may have outward lawfull calling, who, inwardly, hath none, but, by the contrarie, is even a Thiefe in his heart: so may an ordinary Pastour, being, or becōming a Traytour and Wolfe, fall, so from all inward vocation, and, yet retaine, still, outward place &amp; power of ordination, because, albeit a Traitour &amp; Thiefe, his treasō notwithstanding, is not yet detected: whither through his owne craftie cariage &amp; deceitful pretences, still, of a lawful Pastour: or, through the simplicitie of these, who, receaving ordination of him, ar not skilled to discerne his treason, albeit even then deeply and pertly practised, Who, if they knewe it, and yet, would receave ordination of him: as they could not but, in that case, be Traitours also, and have no ordination at all: so, comming, in singlenes, to him, as to a lawfull Minister, and so accounted of all, in common, through the pretence of his Lord his ensigne and service: they may (that way) receave from him a lawfull ordination, the hidde or vnperceaved defect of the ordainer no more derogating to the lawfulnes of the ordination, then doeth the open and seene wickednes of a hyreling Minister impede the efficacie either of ordination or the Sacraments ministred by him, in the faithfull receaver. And, if the equitie of this be so evident, alwayes, as, even in the state of a Church holding purity, al in common, and, where, in that respect, the ordination of but one or fewe persons (who had beene thus ordained by an vnknowen, in the tyme, and, eftsoones detected Wolfe) might with lesse commotion or perill to the body of the Church, be annulled: albeit some men, in detestation of heresie, would vrge it, and, even the, so, ordained, also, (for the more clearing of themselves) should assent to the receaving of newe ordination: yet, if, even in such a case and condition of a Church, no necessitie could ever inforce it vpon the conscience of any: howe much greater, yea and a divers consideration ought to be had, when the whole body of the Church, in common, being affected;

ordination is, in common, stained through all? most part, in common, being Wolves and Thieves, albeit not, as yet, in common, reputed so. For, as Augustin, wisely both wayeth and adviseth, a much different course and cure is to be taken and vsed, in a common evil, which hath overgone the whole body: then when, in a well constitute body (in common) but one or few particular members are affected. And, hereof, Christ, the true both Maister and mirrour of all Wisdome, in his owne practise, gave a cleare lesson. The Scribes &amp; Pharisees were, all, in common, Wolves and Thieves: if perverters of the true sense of the law, and corrupters of all true both word and worshippe, by mixture of their leaven: if persecuters and murtherers of Prophets and of the Lord himselfe: if, who had losed the key of knowledge, and neither themselves entred nor suffred others to enter in the Kingdome of Heaven: if destroyers of soules, making their Disciples, doubly, the children of the Gehenna, may be counted Wolves and Thieves, and, yet, in consideration of their ordinary place in the Church (totally, in common, as then, affected) and, the reputation which they retained, notwithstanding with all, in common, of lawfull Pastours 
                  〈◊〉
               e Lord commandeth to heare and obey them, in the tyme so farre, as, sitting in Moses his chaire,

               ey should teach accordingly. from whom, notwithstanding, as from Murtherers and destroyers, he had resolved to transferre his vineyard and house. And, is, I praye you, the baire receaving of outward ordination, from a man, of more importance, then is our totall submission to him, as to our Pastour, for the whole dispensation of grace to vs in the word and Sacraments? and, if, in such a condition of a Church, wee not only may, but even are commanded to submit our selves so, as, in the tyme (till the Lord discover them and cast them out) we may take good of them, and eschew their evil, in the whole outward ordinary dispensation of graces may not ordination also, in such a case, be lawfull? And may it not be taken also without contagion of the ordayner

his treasonable wickednes? and thus my generall position also standeth true, that, even from a Wolfe or Thiefe vndetected, and, so retaining still the account of a lawfull Pastour, and outward place and power of ordination, &amp;c. lawfull outward ordination may properly and personally flowe. If your Elimas hath remarked me for more then this (I having ever, ioyned the restrict case so clearly) he hath wronged himselfe more then me for, if I had but put these wordes for all (seeing outward ordination serveth but for outwarde order) they might, with any honest hearted Reader, have freed me from all suspicion of so lourd an absurditie. For, what order can be imagined there, where knowne and advoued Haeretikes retaine any place or power in the Church? Nowe, Antichrist, in divers considerations is said to be hidde or covered: and, in divers considerations, to be revealed and detected. First, albeit hee was in the world (as in the seed and first beginnings of his hatching, while the mysterie of iniquitie was covertly begunne to worke) yet he was hidde and covered while light and the truth of the Gospell so prevailed, in common, as, errour was borne downe, and he did not aryse to any sensible height. And 
                  ••
               cordingly, he is said to be revealed, when, through prevailing darknes of the bottomles pitte, he obtained a throne even in the Temple of God. And, even thus, againe (albeit, in a sort revealed) yet he is hidde and covered, so long, as, by his effectuall deceit and pretence of the Lambe his hornes (men not adverting the Dragon his mouth, or made yet wyse to count the number of his name) all, in common, doe still followe him, and wonder after him. and to bee revealed, againe, but that in two degrees (requiring a distinct and wyse consideration, and, which, most plainlie, in his story, are delivered by the spirit,) First, when, by the reviving light of the Gospell, men were brought to see great pollution both in manners and worshippe, and most part flowing from that execrable seat: wherevpon they were moved to detest, and even grievouslie to complaine of the obtaining

evils, and corruption of that seate in speciall. And, yet, this was so, as, his great place and proud pretence of Propheticall authoritie dazeled their weake eyes, in common, from perceaving him clearly to bee, as a corrupt Bishop, so even the adversarie also and Antichrist and, therefore, scarce daring, yet to challenge him so, or to resolve separation from him: they vrged, only, and instantly, reformation of worshippe and manners, in simplicitie (poore honest soules) yet thinking, or not altogither dispairing, but, that the pard could leave his spotts, and the Thiefe and Traitour would reforme: and not yet fully resolved that Babylon could not bee cured. And in this degree, (while not only the Churche in Pergamus, but even in Thyatira, albeit waxing in good workes, yet tollerateth: yea even while that first of the three Angels fleeth and preacheth through the middes of heaven, Revelar. Chapter fourtheene, verse 8.) yet is hee not fully detected. But, when his impatiencie of any cure, and bloodie crueltie in murthering the Saintes (whereby the, earst, spotted Pard becommeth whollie of the Dragon his collour, and, where, firste, but the heade, nowe the whole bodie is full of the names of blasphemie) stirre men not onely to applie the rodde of examination, (whereby to trie, if, possiblie, so bloodie and blasphemous a bodie could bee the true Churche of God) but also, that, thereby, Cittie and Courte are clearelie, founde to bee cast out, when the revived Witnesses are called vp and visiblie separated from his contagious fellowshippe: when the seconde Angell Revelat. Chapter 14. plainlie denounceth Babylons fall, so, proclayming the Traitour: then was hee fullie revealed to bee a Thiefe and Wolfe, and, from that time foorth, no lawefull Ordination could either bee given by him or taken from him. As, thereupon, convenientlie, the thirde Angell Revelat. Chapter 14. verse 9. warneth, and, that, sadly, that none receave his marke.

To reason, then, from Antichrist in the first degrees of the mysterie of iniquitie working towardes a height, to Antichrist inthroned in the Temple: or, from Antichrist sitting, and, by effectuall deceit obtaining in the Temple, to Antichrist revealed: or, from the first degree of detection, to him, now, publiklie, proclaimed a Traitour, and the true church separated frō his fellowship: or from ordination, flowing from him in the one case, to ordinatiō flowing from him on the other: it is deceaving, and yet but grosse sophistication. Now, if even thus, and, in the sense, which I have cleared to bee mine, your man yet hath remarked my position to bee erroneous. And, if hee holdeth that from no Wolfe or Thiefe of whatsoever qualitie or condition any lawfull ordination could ever properly &amp; personally be taken. Then you may tel my remarker, from me, that hee hath remarked that for an errour, which is so evident and stable a truth, as all, any where bearing the Beast his marke, shall never bee able to overthrow it. Though it should never so much grieve him, that thereby, his invincible argument is so vtterly overthrowen, as it, shall never any more find one foot to stand on.
            What your man his (REMARK) doth point at in this part of my words: [And he who receaveth outward ordination is not sworne or tyed to the will or appetit of his ordainer, more then any minister baptizeth in his owne name, &amp;c.] For these wordes he draweth also, I could hardly, coniecture. To shew that the forsaking of the obedience, and deserting the fellowshippe of ones ordainer (tryed a Traitour) taketh not away the deserters ordination: I vsed this argument. That, in our ordination, wee are consecrated, not to men, but to God. And to proove this, I brought the Apostel his reason of the common condition of all Christians. Whom, as Christ hath redeemed with his owne blood, and vindicated to the liberty of the Sonnes of God, so, hath he thereby exemed them, in their spirituall state, from being servants to men. For we have but one Lord: and, we are, no more Paul his, nor Apollo his, nor Cepha his, but Christ his.

And accordingly, with the Apostle, I brought the vse and priviledge of our baptisme, the sacrament of our initation and entrie to that libertie in Christ: in whom only we are baptized, and, to whom only we are thereby consecrated, &amp; not to men. according to which cōmon and cōstant libertie of al Christians by baptisme, I did argue, that, so, in our ordination to any publike office in the church, we are consecrated to Christ and not to men: to be his servants, &amp; not the servants of men. Otherwayes, our ordin'atiō should destroy the libertie of our baptisme: being baptized, first to Christ, &amp; being ordained, next to men. and so shuld Christ be robbed of his inheritance, so dearly purchased, &amp; we of our liberty also. Wherevpon, it doth clearly follow, that in deserting the minister of my ordination (beeing found a wolfe) and, so, cleaving stil to Christ, whose I am, I do not fal away from the prerogative of my calling. For, who did separat vs, Christ or the Pope? and to whose service were we separat, Christ his or the Popes? were we baptized the children of God; to be thereafter, ordained servants of the Pope? what doth your Elymas remarke here? or, because I but touched the argume't, in a word, thinking it enough in so plain a matter, to point at the place, hath therfore, a Doctour of divinitie, mistaken my meaning; whereof no sensible christian could misse the perceptiō? Or, doth this perhaps offend him; that, where in ordination, subiection was professed &amp; sworn to the Pope: yet I make the ordained to be no more sworn to the wil or appetit of the ordainer, thē any minister baptizeth in his owne name? But, I was not cōparing the rituall action or outward forme of baptisme with that of ordination. But (with the Apostle) frō the liberty obtained &amp; sealed vp to vs in baptisme, pleading the same in ordination also: the outward ministerie whereof maketh me no more servant to him who is minister thereof to me, then I was baptized in the name of the minister, but of the Lord. next, it is childish fallacie to reason frō the oath of subiection given to our ordainers in the matter of outward policy &amp; governemēt, &amp; for keeping decēt order

in the house of God: to our spirituall servitude and subiection of our consciences to the will and appetite of men. I let goe, that it is a fallacie also to reason from the ordinarie and subiection to him, to the minister of our ordinatiō, who is not alwayes the ordained his ordinarie. In our reformed Churches, we give our oath of subiectiō to our ordinaries: for, wee know that the house of God is not the house of cōfusion, but of order: and that the spirits of Prophets, are subiect to Prophets. but, doth this mancipate either vs or our ministrie to their will or appetit? Thirdlie, I would aske, if your mā thinketh it all one thing to swear subiection to the Pope; and to be sworne or tied to his wil and appetit? I aske fourthly, if that oath of subiectiō to the Pope was essentiall to lawfull ordination; or, but accessorie? if essentiall, then for many hundreths of yeres in al the Church, almost, there was no lawfull ordination. yea, and the Pope him selfe could have no lawful ordination who can not, neither doeth sweare subiection to him selfe. and, if it be not essentiall, but accessorie, then may both ordination consist without it, &amp; the loosing of it annulleth not the substance of ordinatiō, and the man, who holdeth ordination to be a sacrament (whose common nature is to have relation to the graces of God only, sealed vp or conferred to vs therby: and to serve for notes of our profession of these dueties we owe againe immediatly to God) he should know this also, that by making any oath, in ordination, given to man, to be an essentiall part thereof, hee maketh that man to be God, and that to bee his sacrament &amp; not the Lord his. finallie, I demand whither the oath be given, first, properlie, and principally, to the Pope: or, first, properly, and principally, to Christ? And, whither it be given to the Pope, absolutly, or but in Christ, as to his vicar and minister? If first, properly, and principally, to Christ, &amp; to Christ only, absolutlie: and to the Pope but secundarilie, and in Christ (as I hope none dare deny: except they would, in plain termes, avouch this Pope to be that adversarie exalting himself as God above al that is called God,

or worshipped) thē, I aske, whither finding the Pope to be not Christ his vicar, but the vicar of Satan his throne; king of locusts, and head of apostasie, &amp; thervpon, falling from him; if I have broken any oath given in my ordination? or, if my renūcing of his obedience (found a traitour) looseth my oath first, properly, principally, and absolutly made to Christ? or, if it annichilateth my cōsecration to his service only, in my ordination first &amp; properly frō him, and only to him? whither we do iustly charge the Pope to be Antichrist or not, it is not here the question, but whither he being Antichrist by our doctrine, and wee therevpon deserting him to whose subiection we were sworne: if that annulleth our ordination.
            I have bene the larger in this matter remarked by your man perceaving his chiefe endeavour bended against me there. whither he hath esteemed me, in that part, weakest: or if he hath felt himself assailed, there in the foūdation of his strength: the peril of his invincible argumēt pricking him. for, except vpon the 6.7. &amp; 8. sections of my treatise, he neither vttereth any word, nor giveth any other signification of his meaning throw al, but that vpon the 28. section, he setteth this signe ?. &amp; that so sensibly as any may well perceave he was careful it should be seene, for shewing therewith my defect also signed thereby: &amp; accordinglie I stirred my owne minde to find out what so notable a slippe that could bee, which hee had so singularly noted. But in my dulnes could see nothing, except that there perhaps he thought some occasion might be catched to calumniat, or that there, was ministred to him some matter of mirding. Which sort of wares, these men, in dealing with vs, are accustomed to give vs in steed of solide demonstrations. My wordes to which his signe looketh, are these: for myne owne part, as in all sobernes and cleannes of heart, by the gift of GOD I have bene carefull to know the truth. So, was I never much curious to inquire of the particular state of our first mens callings. VVhich, whither it were ordinarie or extraordinarie, and that wholly or partly, in some men or in all: as it mattereth

litle or nothing (in so great and extraordinarie a work wrought by their ministries as is the discovery &amp; conviction of Antichrist sitting masked in the temple) so is the disputation there about but idle and childish, &amp;c. If vpon my assertion here (in the case so clearly put in my wordes) that disputation about calling is idle &amp; childish: he would build vp this calumnie, that, absolutelie I misregard all respect of calling, and count absolutlie al disputation thereabout, idle &amp; childish: he bewrayeth what spirit he is of: and, both my words here, and the whole tenour of my treatise wil answer for me. If he would skoffe, perhaps, at this: that confessing my self never to have bene much curious to inquire of the particular state of our first mens callings, &amp;c. I shuld yet vndertake the defēce of that which I cōfesse I know not. he sheweth him self, forsooth, to be a solide &amp; serious disputer: who out of 29. sections of my book hath pyoked out this great point against me. But, doth it follow, because I was not much curious to enquire that therfore I do not know the? do mē never know ought, but which they thinke of such momēt as meriteth to be curiously inquired? because I esteemed it no material point, can I not therfore know it? doth it follow, that I have not sought to know it for other respects? Our adversaries vanitie and perversenes make vs to seeke and know divers things: which for any fruit in them, otherways, we would never paine our selfs: but that for stopping their mouthes, and informing the simple against their deceit, we are forced, though with small delight, yet to digge in the dūghils of their durtie devises: so to make the stink of thē knowen. because I have never bin much curious to know the particular state of our first mens callings; can I not therefore, possibly, know the cōmon case? or, can no man be able to defend our first mens callings, in cōmon, but he who hath curiously inquired, by whom, where, and in what particular forme every one singularly was ordained? it becōmeth one professing Divinitie, conscientiouslie and gravelie to conferre for edification; &amp; not, for seducing simple soules, either sophistically, to disput, or childishly, to dally, to his owne disgrace. What is this to the matter in hande; that,

forsooth, I am ignorant of our first mens callings? Or what advantage hath he even in the confession of my ignorāce? If, how litle soever my care or curiositie hath ben to know that matter: yet, in this my careles ignorance, I have said so much for our callings: as (howsoever they would appeare to vilipend it) may make them not only carefull and curious, but even perplexedly anxious also for their owne credit: who alwayes, &amp; everie where, vantingly &amp; vainly gloried, that we were all mad dumbe in the matter of our callings. And albeit I know, that, according to their manner, they will make no end of boasting and altercation: (wherein, I mind not, by the grace of God, to be so badly busied, as to keep a part with them) yet I may boldly affirme: barke, as it as they please, that yet they shall never be able to bring downe or, by sound and solide reason to shake any one ground laid down in that treatise. Wherein I have shewed the bow of our callings so doubly &amp; strong stringed with two stringes: as either of which they shall never be able to cut with all their cunning.
            I could have, perhaps, coniectured (as I know somwhat the manner and meaninges of these men) what surder hee would particularly have said by his other draughts which he hath drawn frequently and only on the 7. &amp; 8. sections. but having cleared the maine point, I will not dally impertinently with him; or struggle with mine own shadow. as even of this, I have here done, he may perhaps say: and you, even therfore, esteeme it true. but, I am sure, I have either mett with his minde; or then hee shall not bee able to render any other such reason of his challenge, which shall not bee found as little, or lesse to his credit. And when ever his dumb draughts are made speaking lines, vppon the little I have lookt in them, I dare give my worde, that they shall bewray weaknes of sense, defect of sinceritie, or fraudulent shifting of the questiō. Now, as my treatise was written, but for information of modest minds and neither for any who will not be cured, neither yet to moove or to maintain iangling with any (an exercise both fruitles &amp; evill beseeming Christians) so, now, for ought

your man could either have said or signed I would not have interchanged one lyne with him. I know what is the efficacie of errour, and bewitching force of the cuppe of forniation in refractary seducers. I know that not onely the blind leaders of the blind, but even such as are joyned to their Idoles are to be let alone. And that such as would appeare to aske counsell of a Prophet, having set vp their Idols in their hearts, &amp; having put the stumbling bloke of their iniquity before their eies: the Lord wil evē, in iustice answer thē according to the multitude of their Idols. But these pages ar to you: in remēbrāce of my offer once made you: if I should find any assurance of a syncere disposition, in al singlenes, &amp; laying a syde preiudice, that you wou
                  •
               d vprightly heare and learne: and, with an vnpartial heart, try &amp; ponder both parts: giving vs the one eare and alike attension: with such other signes of indifferent affectiō, as might assure vs of halfe barr and aequall bench in the seat of your iudgement: and so much the more, as you have these yeeres past given vs evidences of a heart quite alienated from vs, and, as wee plead, from the truth also. And, albeit, as yet, we have gotten of you small or no tokens of any such intention: yet, I would not leave you this to say, that I had failed you promise at the first as neither (if I can yet see your mynd sincerely, carefully, and humbly set for resolution) wil I in this sort, or any other kynd of paines, wearie to doe you pleasure according to my power, in Christ. But, if either you, or any other lust to be contentious, wee have no such manner, neither the Church of God. Now, God even the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, according to his good pleasure &amp; aboūdantly ritch grace, graunt vs that our love may more and more abound in knowledge and all spirituall sense, whereby we may bee able to discerne things that differ: and, prooving all, to hold that which is good: that wee may bee syncere, and without offence till the day of Christ.

            A SHORT DISCOVERIE OF THE ADVERSARIE HIS DOTTAGE, IN HIS IMPERTINENT AND ridiculously deceitfull demaunds.
            
               THat thou mayest perceave (Christian Reader) how foolish &amp; fruitles a labour it is to dispute with these men. When their pamphlet against our callings, which stirred me to defence, was put abroad: it was backed by the applauders thereof, with insolent braggs that no answere either would or could possibly be given it: &amp;, that, though twenty answers were made thereto, yet they should all be refelled with als many sound replyes. Herevpon, at the intreaty of some well affected brethren (least the hearts of our weake ones should be dismayed) I was mooved to writ my treatise of defence: whereof a copy falling in the adversarie his handes (and that without my knowledge and against my purpose, who, hating contention, framed my paines onely for resolution of modest minds) I heard divers and daylie surmises from them, that my treatise would be in short tyme solidly refuted. And, I, accordingly, more exspecting what a traveling mountaine would bring foorth, then mynding any reply therto: at last my copy returned to me carying such notes of a censuring penne as occasioned my epistle to a recusant. Wherevpon their boast of refutation still waxing, and I thereby, exspecting some what more then in end to find but a ridiculous mouse: were brought to me, at length,

after many weekes from the partie, and delivered with no small circumstance, forsooth, and earnest protestation of an answer in writ, these ensuing lines.

                  It is to be demanded of the ministerie, for the true resolution of a Christian soule, which if they resolve not, wee will account them, &amp;c.
               
            
            SEeing the Ministers of Scotland graunts the church of Rome to have been once the true Church of Christ, wee desire them to thew in what yeare of God shee made first defection from the true religion, and by whom shee was condemned for heresie. Likewayes, wee desire to know the names of these who since the Church of Rome fell from the trueth, hes continually from time to time, and age to age professed this religion in all substantiall pointes of doctrine as they presently professe, whose doctrine and writings in all pointes of religion, they will advow and byde by.
            NOw consider (good Reader) what either pitifull ignorance, or rather poysonable perversnes of an inpudently evill conscience these demaundes bewray most evidentlie. Our disputation was about the lawfulnes, or vnlawfulnes of our Pastorall callings. This they by their treatise laboured to evince: I by my defence pleaded the other. In this our litis-contestation, partly by dumbe, partlie by speaking signes and draughtes set by them on the margent, or drawen betwixt the lines of my booke, they sought, at first, that it might seeme they had somewhat to say against me. Therevpon, in my epistle to a Recusant, I sustained my point. Now, in steed of replying ought, either for confirming their owne, or impugning my part of our debated matter, the question is, (whither impudently or ignorantly) altered: and, from the institut point of our vocation, like slipperie Iles, they slyde backe to new demaundes of our doctrine. Is this, I pray you, to dispute, or to dallie? Are these the fresh fyrie edged schoolmen arrived lately, and with so great exspectation of working wonders, from Paris, Lovan, Rhems, &amp; Rome; shaping, shooting,

and slopping men through with syllogismes; who neither, can propoune ought, or sustaine to heare any answere but in forma &amp; figura; that nowe they forget not only all forme and figure; but therewith, all both mense and sense also, in so shamelesly shifting the question, &amp; casting in, kowardly, a kard of another kynd? why remembred they not their owne offer so often and confidently made vs by worde, write and printe; that if we could but once cleare the lawfulnes of our callings, they would, without more adoe or furder disputation about heads of doctrine, give vs their handes? For our vocation I have said somewhat against their obiections in my Treatise of defence. and, againe, in my epistle to a recusant, I have replyed to their censuring notes. If I have cleared the point, why remember they not their covenant? If I have not, yet why, in place of refelling my argumentes and strengthening their owne point, am I deceitfully drawen away from the question in hand; by newe and impertinent demands of a different matter? and yet if in this their shameles shifting, there were, in them, any one spunke of sinceritie, I could even gladly bee drawen to follow them. for that, I confesse, it is a much more sure way from truth of doctrine to establish lawefulnes of vocation, then, vpon the slipperie ground of outward ordinary calling, to build a warrant of doctrine.
            But consider, I pray you, first, the ingenuitie of the demaunder, in the substance of his demaūds: and, next his aequitablenes, in his prescribed rules. wee are desired (in summe) to evince that the Church of Rome hath made apostasie from the truth: and, therewith, to cleare that our doctrine is the veritie of God. But, (shameles men) what have we bene doing, these more then a hundreth yeares agoe, but filling the world with volumes; whereby wee have so plainly discovered their abhominations, and verified the truth of our Doctrine; as wearied with contesting therabout, or rather vexed with their cleare convincing power of light, they were faine to cast vp all either

disputation, &amp; come in end as to their last refuge, to quarrell our vocation? the lawfulnes whereof, when, thervpō we have stablished against al their cavillations, they leape now back, &amp; of new again intend accusation against our doctrine. what is this else, but (as children, in their sporting, childishly practise and more childishly speak) to play titbore tatbore with vs?
            Now, as he hath forgotten all shame in so childish shifting the question, so, by his limitations laid down to vs (I know not by what law) how to answer him in both the points demanded, he exponeth plainly to the perception of any sensible Reader, what sound mind he hath &amp; what aequitablenes is in his dealing with vs. First, for evincing the apostasie of the church of Rome, we must take this law of the demander: that in so farre as the Church of Rome was once the true Church of Christ, we must, therefore, condescend what yeare of God shee made first defection, and by whom (accordingly) shee was condemned of Haeresie. Reasonable men, indeed. And yet their companions in spirit,
                  Iohn 19.7. pretended in als bad a cause, some more equitie: VVe have a law (said they) &amp; by this law he ought to die. Our adversaries, neither having nor so much as pretending any stable law against vs, and therefore in an evill conscience shunning all right lawes of examination: they wil (in no small modestie forsooth) set downe rules of their owne braine, whereby they will have both them selves and vs tryed.
            But, heerein, first, I can not but greatly muze, whither foolishlie or fraudfullie the demander hath fallen vpon so either an improper or so presumptuous a maner of speach, as, indefinitlie and absolutlie, to call the Church of Rome the true Church of Christ. that, consequently, all other churches may either bee secluded from this title, or bee compelled to come in vnder the name of the church of Rome. Neither doe I so much muze hereon, for any doubt I have of the Demaunder his owne meaning (for I know how blasphemouslie bold they are, if not to mende the magnificat; yet to carve careleslie at the Creed, by adding Romanam
               
to Sactam Ecclesiam Catholicam: thus forcing all, if not to receave the character, yet at least the name or number of the beast; but that he proponeth this as a point graūted by vs. I admire his impudencie: for, of the church of Rome; before shee became a harlot, we confesse that shee was a true church of Christ: or one of his true churches: or a true part of that his true church which is but one. but to intitle any particular Church, absolutly and indefinitly, with the name of the true Church of Christ, it is an insolent speach, and not according to the stile of holy scripture, which addeth alwayes some distinguishing designation, as the Church which is at Rome: in Iudea: in Corinth: of Galatia: of Ephesus, Smirna, Pergamus, &amp;c. As for the church of Rome,
               
                  Revel. 17.5 at length, becumming not only a harlot, but also the mother of whoordomes in all the earth, in which respect only it was that all commonlie therein did take her name; wee deny her, so, to bee either the true Church of Christ, or anie true part thereof; but the Synagogue of Sathan and an abhominable Whoore, borne vp and advanced by a blasphemous and bloody beast. howsoever, all the while, vnder and within his vsurpation (even where Satan his throne was) the true Church of God long dwelt shruded and suffered to live vnder the name and number of the beast, yet free alwayes from his character. but, least I seeme over narrowlie to sift syllables, I passe this there, whither ignorant or arrogant, maner of speaking.
            For prooving the church of Rome to have made apostasie from truth, we must, by our adversaries iniunctions, cō
               descend vpon the yere of God, wherein the first made defection: and who they were that, therevpon, even then, convinced her of haeresie. and shall this then serve to exime her or any other church from the blot of defection or haeresie in all time thereafter; and make all whatsoever shee holdeth to be vndoubted truth, if the first houre and firste degrees of her apostasie have escaped a publike note? or howsoever noted, if yet shee hath not bene publikely condemned of haeresie, or howsoever, both noted

and condemned, yet if no publike record thereof be extant to future ages? shall any long space of time iustifie waxing and obtaining errour? or is there any such prescription against truth, but that, jure postlimin
                     •
                  
                at least, it may alwayes pleade iustly for reposition? I leave, here, to the vpright consideration of any indifferent minde, what true confidence these men can have of their owne cause, who prescribe such limitations: and, being challenged of sacrilegious guiltines, will offer themselves no otherwayes to tryall: then, as if a cunning and long covered Thiefe tatched with innumerable fangges, and having all his houses stuffed with stolen wares, yet should partly protest, that in so farre as he had bene once honest, and of all men accounted so: hee ought therefore to be reputed so still, notwithstanding of any thing found by him, except it may bee cleared, what houre of his lyfe he did first begin to steale, in what place, and from what persones, and, therewithall; who had even then convinced and condemned him for a Thiefe. Or as if a subtile and long dissembling harlot, discovered at last, to have opened her feet to all that passe by the way, should yet pleade, that, in so farre as she was once a virgin, and had long retained the reputation of an honest and chast woman, shee ought therefore, to be esteemed so still: except it be plainly prooved against her, what time, first, shee became lascivious, and when, where, and who did first presse the teats of her virginitie: and therewith also who even then vpon the point had cleared and convinced her to be a Harlot, and, thus, the greatest Thiefe in the world might pannel without perill: and the most arrant whoore yet impudently wipe her mouth and say she had committed no iniquitie. He were an impudent fellow who selling rotten and corrupted Wines, yet would boldly affirme them to be freshe and healthsome, because that once they had bene recent and good: neither could any man precisely point to him the houre when they became first purifyed, or produce any who, at that instant, had condemned them for such.
            
               We know that putrifaction cōmeth not at once: but that wine, after that it have loosed som of the colour, yet it wil retaine taste: and after that both colour and taste are a little chaunged, yet while better is not cōmonly to bee had, it will be drunk of and passe for wine. Which, notwithstading, when it hath not only becom aigre, but so rotten also, as it can neither be coūted wine nor serve for vineger, may then not only be condemned as reprobate, but even iustly bee cast out as not only improfitable but also noysome and pestilent.2 Thes. 2.7 We know by scripture and agreeable experiēce, that the course of iniquitie is a mysterie which Sathan even in the Apostolike times and thence forward was a hatching; first by vnperceptible, &amp; next by perceptible, but either not well adverted or not, duelie regarded degrees, till cunningly and covertly at length, in all effectualites of deepe deceit vnder faire pretences, and from small,
                  Revel. 13. and (as appeared) not intolerable beginnings; Antichrist vnder pretence of the Lambe his hornes, obtained a throne even in the temple: and, by proude pretence of Propheticall authoritie, was so borne out in that vsurpation, as,
                  Revel. 2. a long time, the true church dwelling even where Sathan his throne was, and, even there (keeping the name of God, yet had this piece of weaknes, that they tolerated spirituall fornication: Neither that only in the first degree of subtill insinuation thereof, as by Balaam, but even when togither with Propheticall pretence, cruell and bloodie tyrannie, as of Iezabel, was conioyned to maintaine &amp; advance Idolatrie, as, by the states of Pergamus and Thyatira, true types of those times is most cleare: and as, both in my treatise of defence, and in my commentarie on the Revelation I have so clearelie shewed, as, if the demander were not either Piti

               , might have keeped him from forming out thus his owne shame by so ridiculous demaundes. When almost all and everie particular point of doctrine wherewith we charge the church of Rome, are well considered: they will bee found either of late invention, or then with time and by

degrees to have growen vp to capitall praevarications: and that from partly, so laudable, partly, so plausible, partly, so tolerable, partly, so smal and insensible beginnings, as, to men either not so circumspect as to perceave, or of a more peaceable disposition then to contend about everie thing gave not, as they thought, at first great occasion of contesting albeit n

Would Augustin have so spoken of such an article of faith, as vnder paine of eternal flammes must be believed, and for denying of which fantastike fyre, the Romanists have made so many thousands to feele here, the cruel flāmes of reall burning. If that Godly Father had thought that ever any could have so impudently vsurped as to impose so tyrannicall a yoake of bondage on the consciences of Christians; he had altered, I warrant you, his stile to valide

Auricular cōfession though it was of anicient vse: yet, who but ignorants know not, that the practise thereof in primitive tymes was free? Yea and so free, that Nectarius an orthodox and highly commended Bishop of Constantinople, did abrogate al vse thereof, as greatly offensive in the Easterne Churches. Would (I pray you) so godly and approoved a Father have discharged that without which can bee no salvation or remission of sinnes cōmitted after baptisme? Or albeit he might have erred herein, yet would al the Easterne Churches have so lightly subscribed to such an heresie? And howsoever both he and the Easterne churches with him might have fallen so lourdly, yet would all the Westerne Churches and the Bishoppes of Rome (who otherwayes were, in a praeposterous aemulation, more then ready enough oft tymes to pry in and carpe at the defects of that seat) have not only beene silent, at so sacrilegious a derogation of the faith; but also have keeped still communion with Nectarius and the Easterne Churches? Can the Romanistes produce any law, imposing privat confession before the Pontificalitie of Innocentius the third; who was in succession the 183. Bishop of Rome? Who knoweth the date of the Counsell of Latran; but can well enough calcull what tyme, first, any Canon of auricular confession was inacted? A laudable and loving practise of the primitive Church in the commemoration of Martyres, and (according to both the expediency, &amp;, some tymes, the necessitie of these dayes) the assembling and exercising of GOD his worship at their sepulchres: and the godly care, which, against the feritie of beastly persecuters, was had of their funeralles and collecting of their dissipated relicts: to how, not only a superstitious dottage, but even to how detestale an Idolatrie, tyme, by Sathan his subtilitie, made it to degener

The Fathers, in a preposterous zeale and piece of carnall wisdome, seeking to abrogate all memorie of Heathenisme, and finding how difficill a thing it was to reduce superstitious people from a long and plausible custome of evills, they turned all the solemne rites and festivities of tymes and places dedicated and practized in the worship of Heathen Idolls, to the celebration of the memorie and honour of saints.

The execrable erecting and adoratiō of Images (against plaine scripture, expresse iudgement of the Fathers, and cleare Canons of orthodox Counsells) of what time it was, the terrible Tragedies stirred vp thereabout, and the proud and respectles renting of the Church of Christ have left vs too lamentable recordes. If all the Fathers who lived even many hundreths of yeares after Christ, were presentlie reduced to life, &amp; did heare what a stirre is made in the world nowe about trāssubstantiation, would they not all start at once, astonied at so strange a sound? and even bee greatly amazed what monstruous meaning vnder so prodigious a word could be implyed? What would these holy Fathers (who if in any other, have most plainly left their minde in that point) think of the doctrine which now the church of Rome holdeth of the sacred Supper? When even the author of the glosse on the Decretal: albeit him self plunged in a hudge measure of prevayling darknes, yet did so farre skunner at the portētous wordes prescribed by Pope Nicolam to Berengarius (who, as they have given out of him, whither falslie, or that fleeing one extremitie hee did fall perhaps too farre to the other, did think too slenderly, and

speak to warshly of that sacrament) that hee exclaimeth no small perill to be in them of breeding a worse haeresie then was that of Berengarius? Who is so childish as to be ignorant how lately and how audaciously, in an advowed contempt of the Lord his institution, and of all ancient and pure practise of the primitive church, the sacred supper was mutilated, and the people proudly &amp; profanely prohibited all vse of the commanded cuppe?1. Tim. 4. Now in these two points, wherby the Apostle designeth the devilish doctours of later times, who knoweth not what libertie both is left to christians in the written word, and was also long practised in the primitive Church? and how that voluntarie abstinence in both kindes: first to hyperbolically praised; next, too superstitiously admired; albeit no way necessarily required, yet brought men and woemen by time to delite too much in wil-worshippe; and vainly, to become votaries of more then either the Lord required at their handes, or they were able to performe? And Satan thus in end tooke advantage, by his hypocriticall doctours, to the overthrow of all christian libertie; to lay on importable burdens on the consciences of men. Single lyfe, though by some Fathers (too full of their owne sense) it was over farre extolled, even with the contumelious reproaching of that holy bande, which the Lord him selfe first instituted, &amp; that even before sinne came in the world: which by his presēce in the flesh he both countenanced &amp; graced:
                  Gen. 2. Iohn. 2. Heb. 13.4. and which by his Apostle he calleth honorable in al persons: yet was it long ere Satā durst be so impudent as, vnder any hypocriticall pretence of holynes, by the vicar of his throne to open so plainly his Dragon his mouth,1. Tim. 4.3 as to come to

But, vainly &amp; impertinently (which once to think were execrable impiety) had Antichrist his arysing and worke of iniquity beene of the holy Ghost named a mystery, wherein Sathan in all deceaveablenes of vnrighteousnes should bring on such a common apostasie, as whereby his vicar his throne should be erected even in the Church, and who in his owne tyme should be discovered: if the first degrees thereof had beene not onely exposed to common perception, but noted also: neither this only but also publikelie condemned of haeresie. And what will you doe then with these men who will admit no other rules of disputation and examination; but which are plainly repugnant to all the clearly foretold and fallen out course of GOD his wyse dispensation in the case of his Church, and of her condition accordingly?

And is it so indeed, that we have not a more certain rule of truth; then what from age to age men may be cleared to have holden? Or, rather, are not all ages, and all men in all ages, and all and whatsoever opinions of whatsoever men in any age, to bee reduced to

examination by that stable truth and everlasting Gospell which Christ and his Apostles first preached, and thereafter, by the will of God, (as sayeth Ireneus) did put in writ, to remain for ever,

                  Math. 19.8. who teach for doctrines the traditions of men: and against most inveterat, strongly authorized, and obtaining errours, hee opposed this one reason that it was not so from the beginning. The most approoved amongst the Fathers have taught vs, that, for warrant of faith, we have neither to rely vpon what they themselves, or what the Fathers who were before them have said, but vpon that which Christ and his Apostles who were before all have delivered. Antiquity I confesse, were a great argument for truth, if Sathan had not beene a lier from the beginning. And yet the adversarie is so ridiculous as to demaund vs what men they are, whose doctrine and writtings in all points of religion wee will advow and byde ate. But miserable men, is there an option left vs, or any who will not perish in blindnes, to make a choise to whose doctrine and writings in all points of religion wee will betake vs?

That is, onely to these bookes, of Scripture, which are called Canonik, have I learned to yeeld this feare and honour, that I firmelie believe no Author of them to have erred ought in writings. As for others I so read them, as, how excellently soever holy or learned they be, yet I thinke not ought to bee, therefore, true, because they have thought so, but because either by these Canonicall authors, or, by probable reason they were able to perswade me that which doth not abhorre from truth. And have we not more then a thousand times evinced evidētly that we professe &amp; maintaine no other doctrine, then that which Christ &amp; his Apostles first taught by word, &amp; therafter left vs in register for a stable and vndoudted rule to al succeeding ages: &amp; which, in despyt of Satan, albeit busily advancing the mysterie of iniquitie, yet was commonly holden in the Church more then three hundreth yeeres thereafter? And, which, howsoever by prevayling darknes of the bottomles pitt, it was so farre, at length, eclipsed, as Sathan obtayned a throne even in the Temple of God, yet was, all the tyme of that prevayling errour, the true both light and life of these, who dwelling even where Sathan his throne was, and albeit in weaknes tolerating spirituall fornication, yet keeped the name of God,
                  Revel. 20. &amp; lived &amp; reigned with him a 1000. yeres not receaving the beast his character: albeit lurking vnder the shadow of his name or number: &amp;, which, from vnder that overwhelming deluge of darknes, hath brokē foorth again now three hundreth yeres agoe, and that by degrees (praysed bee God) so clearly and powerfully, to the convincing and dispelling therof, as it maketh the recurelesse characterized followers of the beast to gnaw their toungs for sorow &amp; blaspheme bitterly. Our adversaries, in this their demaūd are no lesse ridiculous, thē were either a senseles foole, or a perverse iangler, who, the sunne arysing bright in the morning,

yet because, soone after, it is by degrees so lapped vp in clouddes and mist as it is not seene of men in the earth, till that; some houres before even, breaking out again clearly, &amp; dispelling all that overshadowing darknes, it lighten of new the earth, would, therefore, with pertinacie plead that the sunne thus wrestling out from vnder that overvailing cloud, were not the true sunne which in the morning had shyned, but some counterfait and never before seene Comet: because, foresooth, their eies had not all the minuts of the day sensibly seene the shyning body and particular progres of it. But, poor Idiots, the sunne hath such a soveraine and singular both light and heat, as, though all the dolts in the worlde would disclaime it, yet wil evince it, to be alwayes one and the same:
                  Exod. 10.23. and, albeit long covered and vnperceaved in common, yet that, all the while, it still so shyned, as howsoever in all Aegipt was palpable darknes, yet, in Gosben was cleare and confortable light.
            In my treatise of defence and 19. section thereof, answering this same obiection, I alledged, that as divers of our men had done, so I might bring faire Catalogues of men who in former ages had holden the truth &amp; heavely lamented the prevayling corruptions of their tymes. But I gave, there, divers and good reasons why neither ought that iustly bee required of vs, neither we bee so foolish as to divert with our adversaries to so vnnecessary an altercation. And, long before, in my commentarie vpon the 14. Chap. of the Revelation, I shewed, how, to answer the adversarie ought hereto, were but vainly to hale the coard of contention with men whose mouthes wee might stoppe by more sure and evident arguments. And yet the adversarie (in a good conscience I warrant you, of a iust cause) will admit, now, no rule whereby to examine vs, but which hee knew verie well that, before any demande from him, I had, for good reasons, reiected: and he is so extreemly impudent heerein, as not onely without refelling any of my reasons, he still vrgeth it: but fearing also what herein I might verie well performe if I pleased to answer a foole to his follie, and so

proove a foole with him: that, wherto I refused to answere, being proponed evē in a large case, he reponeth to me now with such strict limitations, as any sensible Reader may evidently perceave, he hath fore-caston his evasions how to escape taking. And for this it is that, forsooth, we must show who frō age to age not onley held, but also professed the same Religion, and that in all substantiall points. And whose writinges, in all points wee will advow and byde at. Heere, hee hath prepared to him selfe exceptions against any whom hee thinketh that, in those most corrupted times, wee can produce against him. First, if hee hath not openlie avowed and professed: next, if hee hath not professed all the substantiall points which wee holde. Thirdly, if we advow not and byde at al whatsoever they have written in all and any point of Religion. Sweet, indeed, and sounde hearted disputers. By this law laide downe to vs by these aequitable men, not only shall they serve vs for no witnesses who through ignorance or infirmitie, or common errour in the tyme have impinged, perhaps, in some points, but even their silence or want of a remaining record behinde them, in anie one point professed by vs, shall get them casten. But (which before I have shewed) as all evills did not arise at once, neither, at firste to such degree as where fore men would be soone caried to open contestation: so (albeit in a common vse and prevayling practise, yet before any tyrannicall yoake was imposed on consciences, by inforcing lawes) while a libertie was left to men of holding them selves pure, and keeping the name of GOD, they were loath, with evident hazard, to contende against evill so subtillie insinuated, and by pretence of Propheticall authoritie, so arrogantly advaunced. A weaknes, I confesse, in them, but such as the holy Ghost hath clearely foretolde vs should befall even his true and faithfull Church, dwelling where Sathan his throne was. And, which, the more the mysterie of iniquitie wrought on, was the lesse wonderfull: in regarde of the tyrānicall vsurpation, wherby no libertie was left (without certaine peril) of anie open opposition; or, if, of open profession, yet not of publishing

in writte: or, if of this, yet not of preserving any recorde thereof to the posteritie.
            Now, besides this, what marvaill, in such a common apostasie, and ecclipse of all true light, though even these good and godly men (who both mourned for it, and in the middes of it keeped the name of God, holding the substantiall foundation of salvation) were some what tainted in many thinges with the contagion of the tyme? Whither that thorough defect of knowledge they were imprudentlie miscaried in some points, or, rather through defect of courage, they tolerated what otherwayes they would never have approoved. Whose weaknes, heerein, albeit the holy Ghost taxeth,
                  Epist. 119. ad Ianuar.
                yet hath hee, indulgently, covered it vnder the lappe of his garment. Augustin, whyle some tolerable estate of a Church still remayned, yet heavilie, regraiteth, that even in his time the Church of God (which her Lord will have to bee free) was so burdened with multitude of superfluous and superstitious ceremonies, as the state of the Iewes, vnder their Pedagogie was more tolerable. In the succeeding ages, the evill had so farre waxed, as, in consideration of the great corruption, Gregorie the first Bishop of Rome, did not sticke to affirme (and truely) that, Antichristus,

To the Bishop of Rome he writeth thus: inter haec,

Soone after these times men begā not only to see the Bishop of Rome a corrupted Bishop, but also to suspect him a Traitour: and not so much look that, by him, any reformatiō should come, as to dispaire that he could be cured:
                  Revel. 10. and 11. till at last, the eyes of some (through the little booke sweetly swallowed and reid applied) were opened to see him, and confidently to cal him the beast of the Dragon his throne and authority. The adversarie forecasting with him selfe what, in this case we might be able to alledge against him, hath tymouslie, in his demaunds, builded to him selfe backdores, whereby if we would shew murmur &amp; querimoniā omnium ecclesiarum, he shal start out at the postern of opē profession, and that of all substantial points. If we bring Gregory or Bernard, or other such: then, some particular defectes of these godly mē (which both the Lord hath mercifully passed by and we also would charitably cover) are narrowlie sitted out &amp; cast in our teeth, to deprive vs of al their good. so as, except by his forlaid rule, wee advow and byd at all whatsoever they have written, they must stande vs for no witnesses. But, herein, a needles fear hath made my adversarie vnnecessarily to bewray himself how small either cō
               fidence or good conscience he hath in the matter which he maintaineth. For, I was never purposed to dally with him in this kind; or to be drawen deceitfully by him from sure &amp; solid groūds, to divert foolishly to so wyde and vain a field of endles altercatiō. We know assuredly, that God, alwayes had a number who keeped his name and leived his life not only in the Primitive &amp; most pure times while the woman

was yet cloathed with the Sun, Revel. 12. and even thereafter also when corruption came on in such degrees, as the third of al green thing in earth,
                  Revel. 8. the third of the sea &amp; things therein, the third of fountaines and rivers, the third of Sun, Moone, starres, day &amp; night, was smitten: Neither only now againe, in the reviving light of the Gospell since the first of three Angels break out through the midds of heaven with the euerlasting gospel, Revel. 14. (whereby the Sun, by degrees, wresting out frō vnder that darknes,
                  Revel. 18.1. hath now at last lightened al the earth with the glorie thereof) but that evē in those mid and most miserable times,
                  Revel. 9. and 13. wherein Sūne and aire were totally eclipsed by the smoake of the bottomles pitt, and all the earth followed the beast, yet still also God had a number sealed: and, that, howsoever (in cōmon) they were so farr either in simplicitie abused, or by fear dismayed, as to tolerate spirituall fornication, and to receave the name or number of the beast, yet, they keeped the name of the Lambe his father, and never receaved the beast his character. of whose murmurings and regrets (in despite of all repressing and suppressing tyrannie) we could bring, &amp; divers of vs have more then once brought such instāces from storie, as may confirme any cleane hearted man that, both sparkles of true light remained and many also were inlightened and lived thereby even while Antichrist by prevayling darknes appeared to obtaine all. But, to bee drawen childishlie to answer our adversaries heerein according to their perverse minde, and prescriptions &amp; limitations, impudently, against al law and reason, and in an evidencie of an evill and self-accusing conscience, laid down vnto vs, it were not only to answer a foole to his foolishnes, and so to become a foole with him: but it were even to discredit that vndoubted truth which we professe: by labouring to prove such a case as is flat contrarie to the clearly foretold course, both of God his wise dispensation, and (by his permission) of Sathan his subtill dealing in the mysterie of iniquitie waxing, obtayning, discovered, and overthrowen. The holy Ghost hath so clearely foretold both the case, and particular

course, as, either our adversaries ignorance is miserable, or their perversnes abhominable. Wee are forwarned of such an Apostasie as whereby Antichrist shall sit Lieutenant of the Dragon his throne, even in the Church of God (as even Augustin inclineth to interpret.)

We are forwarned that Antichrist shall so tyrannize in the holy City and Court of the Temple (the visible church)
                  Revel. 11. and 13. as all true worshippe shal be trodden downe therin as it was in Israel by Iezabell three yeeres and a halve of famine: and by Antiochus Epiphanes, abrogating the daylie sacrifie and erecting the abhomination of desolation in place thereof, the same space: and yet that all the while GOD should secretly &amp; wonderfully preserve two Candlestiks and two Olyves within the Temple. And our adversaries yet will have vs to shew an advowed standing true worshippe all that tyme even in the Citie and Court. Now what were this, I pray you, but either blasphemouslie to belie the holy Ghost, or foolishlie to discredit that vndoubted truth which wee holde? So miserablie ignorant are our adversaries, that they perceave not how that, which they most obiect against vs, speaketh stronglie for vs; and

even in that wherein they most glorie, is their evident disgrace.
            And yet these demaunds, which I have thus shortlie discovered to be impertinent, foolish, and fraudulent, are sent to vs with a supercilious certification, that except wee resolve them, therin they will account vs, &amp;c. Satis, foresooth, pro imperio: their, &amp;c. I warrant you implyeth a ponderous Apostopesis of much worse then they would say out, or yet their Paper could beare without blushing: yet, they can account no worse of vs then their companions in spirit did of our Lord and maister, whom they called a Samaritan and a Devill. And with them wee can neither exspect nor covet to bee in any better account, except wee were lyars and murtherers like themselves. But wee passe verie little to be iudged of such as the Lord, in iustice, hath given vp to mindes void of all true iudgement. And shal any terrour then of this their supercilious certificat stirre vs to play the fooles in answering thē, in that which a 1000. times already hath ben evinced? That as, now, to escape taking, they have in an evil conscience start from the questiō of our vocation to these demaūds of our doctrine, so when they ar reduced of new to any strait herein, they may als shamelesly cast in again to vs. O but where is your calling? Shall we labour to resolve those who even professe that they are in nothing so much resolved as in this that they will never either seek for or admit any resolution? shal we either disput with such Doctours; as give their disciples infallibly to hold; or take paines for resolution of such disciples, as readily receave, believe, &amp; maintain; that for them to read scripture, is not only a profitles, but also a perillous exercise: that the true sense of the holy Ghost &amp; of scripture may be more certainly had from the Doctours then from scripture: and that yet, through their diversity of opinions &amp; even doubtfull delivery therof, wherthrough the protestāts plead that the most approoved Fathers stand for them, so incertaine also is any resolution that way, that to have the soule fully setled, it must simply &amp; wholy rely vpon the iudgemēt &amp; determination of the church:

which the ghostly Father will take vpon his soul to be only that Rome: that, in any case, all conference with ministers, all reading of their workes, and hearing of their sermons be carefully eschewed. And, if vpon any necessitie it should befal them at any time to be present at a preaching, then, either to sleep or stoppe their eares: or if they must here, yet that they never suffer their hearts once cōdescend to esteeme any better of them (how plainly, powerfully, or holily soever they appeare to speake) but that it is Sathan speaking to them in a man his semblance. These late arrived Rabbies who are so securely roving in these quarters and subverting instable soules: and their disciples also who give them so glad eares, know very well, if I have heere summarily comprysed and rightly recounted to them the compend of their Ca
                  •
               echisme. So as, in conference with some of ours, one did not stick (ô prodigious blasphemy) to answer, away with your Scripture, you may proove a hundreth lyes from Scripture. And is it with such Doctours as deny the principles, and destroying all true grounds of resolution, will tye men to fansies of their owne imposing that wee should disput? Or have we to busie our selves for resolving of such disciples, as (because the shining light of the Gospell cannot bee gotten extinguished) therefore, either gladly learne, wilfully to winck at it, or, willingly, yeeld their eies to bee pyked out, least they should see and turne? shal we then answer these demaunds. Or (as Godly and wyse Ezechia, in the case of rayling Rabsacbee) shall wee not resolve rather not to answer them one worde, but to spred out their blasphemies before the Lord? Yea verely. Neither is ought I have heere said so much to make them any answere, as to open to true Christian soules (in Christian singlenes &amp; sobernes seeking light, &amp; not in pryd &amp; perversnes to strengthen the Idols of their owne hearts) how impertinently, ridiculouslie, &amp; deceitfullie, these demaundes are proponed. For whose fuller resolution herein, &amp;c how farre &amp; what is requisit to be answered to them: besides many other &amp; more learned works thē my slēdernes can affoord: let thē read also my preceeding

treatises of defence, and my cōmentarie on the Revelatiō
               : and thereof, specially, that typicall relation which the seven Churches of Asia have to the militant Church according to her distinct and succeeding cōditions in the mystery of iniquitie working on the height, and her arising againe from vnder that evill (which point in the London copies, vpon misconceaved ielousies was left out) what I have writtē on the 8.9.10.11.14.16.17. and 20. chapters thereof. Read my Lord of Plessie his learned workes of the mysterie of iniquitie. and, who lift to take the paines, for more clear &amp; ample accommodation of all, let them read the Magdeburgick storie and the particular conditions of the church set downe therin at length everie centenarie of yeares from our Lord his incarnation till our dayes. By these, any soundly set &amp; sensible soule shall finde sufficient resolution of al the course of Antichrist by degrees arysing to the toppe of sacrilegious impietie: and how God still preserved a church, in the mids of his most tyrannical vsurpation: as for such persons as demand vs with no other hearts then the Pharisies did Christ, or, these, who hypocriticallie asking counsell at the Prophet, and, then, not finding it agreable to the biais of their foreplotted and corrupt conceptions, did therefore, impudently tell him,
                  Ier. 43.2. &amp; 44.16. 
               thou speakest falstie, the Lord our God hath not sent thee and, the word which thou hes spoken to vs in the name of the Lord we will not heare it of thee, but we will doe whatsoever thing goeth out of our owne mouth, &amp;c. These we leave to the mist of their owne imaginations, and iust induration of their owne deceitful and deceaved myndes: whereto they are given vp iustly of the Lord,1 Cor. 14.37 Math. 11.19 Revel. 22.1
                     •
                  
                because they delight in lies. If any man be spirituall, let him acknowledge, that what I writ, is the truth of God: if any man will be ignorant, let him bee ignorant. Wisdome will bee alwayes iustified of her owne children: and such as are filthie, let them be filthie still.

            That is.
            IF the weake sense of humane custome were not bolde to withstand the reason of cleare truth, but did subdue her maladie to healthsome doctrine, as to a medicine, till (holy faith obtayning) by divine aide it were healed: then to such men as, both themselves mean soundlie, and, with dexteritie doe expresse their meanings in sufficient words, it shuld not be needfull to spend much speach, for convincing what soever erronius and vaine opinion. But, now, because that disease of foolishe mindes is so much the greater and more detestable, as, even after a reason is fully given them (so far as man to man is holden) yet they maintaine no lesse their vnreasonable motions, then if they were selfe reason

and truth: whither that this falleth through too great blindnes whereby they are not able to perceave most plaine things; or through most obstinat perversnes, whereby they cannot abyde even these things which they perceave clearly: therefore, oftymes, men are, of necessitie, forced to speak the more amply even of plaine matters: as offering them not so much to the view of men who see, but even, in a sort, to bee handled by groapers and winkers. And yet, what either end shall their be of disputation, or what measure of writing; if we think that replyes must bee alwayes, made to them who answere vs? for, who either are not able to vnderstand what is said, or, are so refractarie through frowardnes of minde; as even, though they vnderstand, yet they will not yeeld: they answere still (as it is written) and pratle iniquitie, and they are vaine without wearying. Whose gaine-sayings if we would refell als often as, with wilfull headines, they determine not to care what they say, so they, any way gainsay our disputations: thou seest how endles, toilsome, and vnfruitfull a busines it were. Wherefore, my sonne Marcellin, I neither would have thee nor any others (for whose vse and vtilitie these my paines are, in the love of Christ, and freely taken) to be such iudges of my writings as doe, alwayes require a reply to be made, whensoever they heare that ought is said against these things which they reade: Least they become like to these woemen of whom the Apostle maketh mention, which are ever learning, but never attaine to the knowledge of the Truth.
