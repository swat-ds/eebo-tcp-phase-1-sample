            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            The Comicall Historie of Alphonsus, King of Arragon.
         
         
            Act. I.
            After you haue sounded thrise, let Venus be let downe from the top of the Stage, and when she is downe, say.
            
               POets are scarce when Goddesses themselues
               Are forst to leaue their high and stately seates
               Placed on the top of high Olympus Mount,
               To seeke them out, to pen their Champions praise.
               The time hath bene when Homers sugred Muse,
               Did make each Eccho to repeate his verse,
               That euery coward that durst crack a speare,
               And Tilt and Turney for his Ladies sake,
               Was painted out in colours of such price
               As might become the proudest Potentate.
               But now a dayes so yrksome Idels slights,
               And cursed charmes haue witch'd each students mind,
               That death it is to any of them all,
               If that their hands to penning you do call:
               Oh Virgil, Virgil, wert thou now aliue,
               Whose painfull pen in stout Augustus dayes,
               Did daigne to let the base and silly flea
               To scape away without thy praise of her.
               I do not doubt but long or ere this time,
               
                  Alphonsus fame vnto the heauen's should clime:
               
                  Alphonsus fame that man of Ioue his seed,
               Sprung from the loines of the immortall Gods,
               
                  
Whose sire although he habit on the earth,
               May claime a portion in the fierie Pole,
               As well as any one what ere he be.
               But setting by Alphonsus power diuine,
               What man aliue or now amongst the ghoasts
               Could counteruaile his courage and his strength?
               But thou art dead, yea Virgil thou art gon:
               And all his acts drownd in obliuion.
               And all his acts drownd in obliuion?
               No Venus no, though Poets proue vnkind,
               And loth to stand in penning of his deeds,
               Yet rather then they shall be cleane forgot,
               I which was wont to sollow Cupids games
               Will put in vre Mineruaes sacred Art,
               And this my hand which vsed for to pen
               The praise of loue, and Cupids peerles power,
               Will now begin to treat of bloudie Mars,
               
               Of doughtie deeds and valiant victories.
            
            Enter Melpomine, Clio, Errato, with their sisters, playing all vpvpon sundrie Instruments, Calliope onely excepted, who comming last, hangeth downe the head, and plaies not of her Instrument.
            
               But see whereas the stately Muses come,
               Whose harmony doth very far surpasse
               The heauenly musick of Appolloes pipe.
               But what meanes this Melpomine her selfe
               With all her sisters sound their Instruments,
               Onely excepted faire Calliope?
               
               Who comming last &amp; hanging downe her head,
               Doth plainly shewe by outward actions
               What secret sorrow doth torment her heart.
            
            Stands a side.
            
               
               Mel.
               
                  Calliope thou which so oft didst crake,
               How that such clients clustred to thy Court
               By thick and threefold, as not any any one
               Of all thy sisters might compare with thee:
               Where be thy schollers now become I troe?
               Where are they vanisht in such suddain sort,
               That while as we do play vpon our strings,
               You stand still lazing, and haue nought to do?
            
            
               Clio.
               
                  Melpomine make you a why of that?
               I know full oft you haue Authors red,
               The higher tree the sooner is his fall,
               And they which first do flourish and beare sway,
               Vpon the sudden vanish cleane away.
            
            
               Cal.
               Mocke on apace, my backe is broad enough
               To beare yout flouts as many as they be.
               That yeare is rare, that nere feeles winters stormes:
               That tree is fertile which nere wanteth frute.
               And that same Muse hath heaped well in store:
               Which neuer wanteth clients at her doore.
               But yet my sisters, when the surgent seas
               Haue ebde their fill, their waues do rise againe
               And fill their bankes vp to the very brimmes:
               And when my pipe hath easd her selfe a while,
               Such store of suters shall my seate frequent,
               That you shall see my schollers be not spent.
            
            
               Errato.
               Spent (quoth you) sister, then we were too blame
               If we should say your schollers all were spent:
               But pray now tell me when your painfull pen will rest enough?
            
            
               Mel.
               When husbandmen sheere hogs.
            
            
               Ven.
               
                  Melpomine, Errato and the rest,
               From thickest shrubs dame Venus did espie
               The mortall hatred which you ioyntly beare
               Vnto your sister high Calliope.
               
               What do you thinke if that the tree do bend,
               
                  
It followes therefore that it needs must breakes
               And since her pipe a litle while doth rest,
               It neuer shall be able for to sound?
               Yes Muses yes, if that she wil vouchsafe
               To ente
                     •…
                  tain Dame Venus in her schoole,
               And further me with her insti

                  tions,
               She shall haue schollers which wil daine to be
               In any other Muses companie.
            
            
               Calliope.
               Most sacred Venus do you doubt of that?
               
                  Cal
                        •…
                     ope would thinke her three times blest,
               For to receiue a Goddes in her schoole,
               Especially so high an one as you,
               Which rules the earth, and guides the heauens too.
            
            
               Ven.
               Then sound your pipes, and let vs bend our steps
               Vnto the top of high Pernassus hill,
               And there togither do our best deuoyr
               For to describe Alphonsus warlike fame:
               And in the maner of a Comedie,
               Set downe his noble valour presently.
            
            
               Calli.
               As Venus wils, so bids Calliope.
               
            
            
               Melpo.
               And as you bid your sisters do agree.
            
            Exeunt.
            Enter Clarinus the Father, and Alphonsus his sonne.
            
               Carinus.
               My noble sonne, since first I did recount
               The noble acts your predecessors did
               In Aragon, against their war
                     •…
                  ke foes,
               I neuer yet could see thee ioy at all,
               But hanging downe thy head as malcontent:
               Thy youthfull dayes in mourning haue bene spent.
               Tell me Alphonsus what might be the cause
               That makes thee thus to pine away with care?
               Hath old Carinus done thee any offence
               In reckning vp these stories vnto thee?
               
                  
What nere a word 
                     〈◊〉

               Alphon.
               Although deare father I haue often vowde
               Nere to vnfold the secrets of my heart
               To any man or woman, who some ere
               Dwels vnderneath the circle of the 
                     •…
                  kie:
               Yet do your words so coniure me deare sire,
               That needs I must fulfil that you require.
               Then so it is, amongst the famous tales
               Which you rehearst done by our sires in warre,
               When as you came vnto your fathers daies,
               With sobbing notes, with sighs &amp; blubbring teares,
               And much ado, at length you thus began.
               Next to Alphonsus should my father come,
               For to possesse the Diadem by right
               Of Aragon, but that the wicked wretch
               His yonger brother, with aspiring mind,
               By secret treason robd him of his life,
               And me his sonne, of that which was my due.
               These words my sire, did so torment my mind,
               As had I bene with Ixion in hell,
               The rauening bird could neuer plague me worse:
               For euer since my mind hath troubled bene
               Which way I might reuenge this traiterous fact,
               And that recouer which is ours by right.
            
            
               Cari.
               Ah my Alphònsus neuer thinke on that,
               In vaine it is to sttiue against the streame,
               The Crowne is lost, and now in hucksters hands,
               And all our hope is cast 
                     •…

               My noble Lords of Aragon, I know
               You wonder much what might the occasion be,
               That Laelius which earst did flie the field,
               Doth egge you forwards now vnto the warres,
               But when you heare my reason, out of doubt
               Yowle be content with this my rash attempt.
               When first our King, Flaminius I do meane,
               Did set vpon the Neapolitans,
               The worst of you did know and plainly see,
               How farre they were vnable to withstand
               The mightie forces of our royall Campe,
               Vntill such time as froward fates we thought,
               Although the fates ordaind it for our gaine,
               Did send a straunger stout, whose sturdie blowes
               And force alone, did cause our ouerthrow.
               But to our purpose, this same martiall knight
               Did hap to hit vpon Flaminius,
               
               And lent our King then such a friendly blow,
               As that his gasping ghost to Lymbo went:
               Which when I sawe, and seeking to reuenge,
               My noble Lords, did hap on such a prize:
               As neuer King nor Keisar got the like.
            
            
               Mi.
               
                  Laelius, of force we must confesse to thee,
               We wondred all, when as you did perswade
               Vs to returne vnto the warres againe,
               But since our maruell is increased much
               
                  
By these your words, which sound of happinesse,
               Therefore good Laelius make no tarrying,
               But soone vnfolde thy happie chaunce to vs.
            
            
               Lae.
               Then friends and fellow souldiers, hark to me.
               When Laelius thought for to reuenge his king,
               On that same knight, in steed of mortall foe,
               I found him for to be our cheefest friend.
            
            
               Mi.
               Our cheefest friend, I hardly can beleeue,
               That he which made such bloudie massacres
               Of stout Italians, can in any poynt
               Beare friendship to the countrey or the King.
            
            
               Lae.
               As for your king Miles, I hold with you,
               He beare no friendship to Flaminius,
               
               But hated him as bloudie Attropos,
               But for your countrey, Laelius doth a
                     •…
                  owe,
               He loues as well as any other land:
               Yea sure he loues it best of all the world:
               And for because, you shall not thinke that I
               Do say the same without a reason why,
               Know that the knight Alphonsus hath to name,
               Both sonne and heire to olde Carinus, whom
               Flaminius sire bereaued of his Crowne:
               Who did not seeke the ruine of our host,
               For any enuie he did beare to vs,
               But to reuenge him on his mortall foe,
               Which by the helpe of high celestiall Ioue,
               
               He hath atchieu'd with honour in the field.
            
            
               Mi.
               Alphonsus man, ile nere perswaded be,
               That ere Alphonsus may suruiue againe,
               Who with Carinus many yeares agoe,
               Was said to wander in the stigian fieldes.
            
            
               Laeli.
               Truth Noble Miles, these mine eares haue heard,
               For certaintie reported vnto me,
               That olde Carinus with his peerlesse sonne,
               Had felt the sharpnesse of the sisters sheeres,
               
                  
And had I not of late Alphonsus seene
               In good estate, though all the world should say
               He is aliue, I would not credit them:
               But fellow souldiers wend you backe with me,
               And let vs lurke within the secret shade,
               Which he himselfe appointed vnto vs:
               And if you find my words to be vntroth,
               Then let me die to recompence the wrong.
            
            Strike vp alarum, Enter Albinius with his sword drawne, and say.
            
               Albi.
               Laelius make haste, souldiers of Aragon,
               
               Set lingring by, and come and helpe your King.
               I meane Alphonsus, who whilest that he did
               Pursue Belinus at the very heeles,
               Was suddenly enuironed about,
               With all the troupes of mightie Millain land.
            
            
               Mi.
               What newes is this, and is it very so?
               Is our Alphonsus yet in humane state,
               Whom all the world did iudge for to be dead.
               Yet can I scarce giue credit to the same.
               Giue credit, yes, and since the Millain Duke,
               Hath broke his league of friendship, be he sure,

               Such mortall treason gainst his soueraigne,
               As when he should with fire and sword defend
               Him from his foes, he seekes his ouerthrow?
               March on my friends, I nere shall ioy at all,
               Vntill I see that bloudie traytors fall.

               NO sooner did Alphonsus with his troupe,

               But that the furie of his sturdie blowes,
               Did strike such terror to their daunted mindes,
               That glad was he which could escape away,
               With life and limme, forth of that bloudie fray.

               With mickle more, this Act shall shew you plaine.

               When doubting that his force was ouerweake,
               
                  
For to withstand Miles, thy sturdie arme
               Did giue more credence to his frisking skippes
               Then to the sharpnesse of his cutting blade,
               What Fabius did to pleasure vs withall,
               Albinius knowes as well as I my selfe:
               For well I wot, if that thy tyred steed
               Had bene as fresh and swift in foote as his,
               He should haue felt, yea knowne for certaintie,
               To checke Alphonsus, did deserue to die.
               Breefly my friends and fellow peeres in armes,
               The worst of you doo deserue such mickle praise,
               As that my tongue denies for to set forth
               The demie parcell of your valiant deeds,
               So that perforce, I must by dutie be
               Bound to you all, for this your curtesie.
            
            
               Mi.
               Not so my Lord, for if our willing armes
               Haue pleasured you so much, as you do say,
               We haue done nought but that becommeth vs:
               For to defend our mightie soueraigne.
               As for my part, I count my labour small,
               Yea though it had bene twise as much againe,
               Since that Alphonsus doth accept thereof.
            
            
               Alphon.
               Thankes worthie Miles, least all the world
               Should count Alphonsus thanklesse for to be,
               Laelius sit downe, and Miles sit by him,
               And that receiue, the which your swords haue wonne.
               
                  Sit downe Laelius and Miles.
               First, for because thou Laelius in these broyles,
               By martiall might, didst proude Belinus chase,
               From troupe to troupe, from side to side about,
               And neuer ceast from this thy swift pursute,
               Vntill thou hadst obtaind his royall Crowne,
               Therefore I say, ile do thee nought but right,
               And giue thee that which thou well hast wonne.
               
                  
Set the Crowne on his head.
               Here doth Alphonsus Crowne thee Laelius, King
               Of Naples Towne, with all dominions
               That earst belonged to our trayterous foe,
               That proud Belinus in his regiment.
               Sound Trumpets and Drummes.
               Miles, thy share the Millaine Dukedome is,
               For well I wot thy sword deseru'd no lesse.
               Set the Crowne on his head.
               The which Alphonsus frankly giueth thee,
               In presen
                     •…
                   of his warlike men at armes.
               And if that any stomacke this my deed,
               Alphonsus can reuenge thy wrong with speed.
               Sound Trumpets and Drummes.
               Now to Albinius which in all my toyles
               I haue both faithfull, yea and friendly found:
               Since that the Gods and friendly Fates assigne
               This present time to me to recompence,
               The sundry pleasures thou hast done to me,
               Sit downe by them, and on thy faithfull head
               Take the Crowne from thy owne head.
               Receiue the Crowne of peerlesse Aragon.
               
            
            
               Albi.
               Pardon deare Lord Albinius at this time,
               It ill becomes me for to weare a Crowne,
               When as my Lord is destitute himselfe:
               Why high Alphonsus, if I should receiue
               This Crowne of you, the which high Ioue forbid,
               Where would your selfe obtaine a Diadem?
               
                  Naples is gone, Millaine possessed is,
               And nought is left for you but Aragon.
               
            
            
               Alphon.
               And nought is left for me but Aragon?
               
               Yes surely yes, my Fates haue so decreed,
               That Aragon should be too base a thing,
               For to obtaine Alphonsus for her King.
               What heare you not how that our scattered foes,
               
                  
                  Belinus, Fabius, and the Millaine Duke,
               Are fled for succour to the Turkish Court?
               And thinke you not that Amurack their King,
               Will with the mightiest power of all his land,
               Seeke to reuenge Belinus ouerthrow?
               Then doubt I not but ere these broyles do end,
               
                  Alphonsus shall possesse the Diadem
               That Amurack now weares vpon his head.
               Sit downe therefore and that receiue of mee:
               The which the Fates appointed vnto thee.
            
            
               Albi.
               Thou king of heauen, which by thy power diuine,
               Dost see the secrets of each liuers heart,
               Beare record now with what vnwilling mind,
               I do receiue the Crowne of Aragon.
               
            
            
               Albinius sit downe by Laelius &amp; Miles, Alphonsus set the Crowne on his head, and say.
            
               Alphon.
               A rise Albinius King of Aragon,
               
               Crowned by me, who till my gasping ghost
               Do part asunder from my breathlesse corpes,
               Will be thy shield against all men aliue:
               That for thy kingdome any way do striue.
               Sound Trumpets and Drummes.
               Now since we haue in such an happie houre
               Confirmd three kings, come let vs march with speed
               Into the Citie, for to celebrate
               With mirth and ioy, this blisfull festiuall.
            
            Exeunt omnes.
            Enter Amurack the great Turke, Belinus, Fabius, Arcastus King of Moores. Claramount, King of Barbery. Baiazet a Lord, with their trai

               Amu.
               Welcome Belinus to thy cosens Court,
               Whose late arriuall in such posting pace,
               
                  
Doth bring both ioy and sorrow to vs all:
               Sorrow because the Fates haue bene so false,
               To let Alphonsus driue thee from thy land:
               And ioy, since that now mightie Mahomet
               
               Hath giuen me cause to recompence at full,
               The sundry pleasures I receiu'd of thee.
               Therefore Belinus do but aske and haue:
               For Amurack doth grant what ere you craue.
            
            
               Beli.
               Thou second sun which with thy glimsing beames
               Doest clarifie each corner of the earth,
               
                  Belinus comes not, as earst Mydas did,
               To mightie Bacchus, to desire of him,
               That what so ere at any time he toucht,
               Might turned be to gold incontinent.
               Nor do I come as Iuppiter did erst
               Vnto the Pallace of Amphitrion,
               
               For any fond or foule concupiscence,
               Which I do beare to Alcumenaes hew.
               But as poore Saturne, forst by mightie Ioue
               
               To flie his Countrey, banisht and forlorne,
               Did craue the aide of Troos, King of Troy.
               
               So comes Belinus to high Amurack.
               
               And if he can but once your aide obtaine,
               He turnes with speed to Naples backe againe.
            
            
               Amu.
               My aide Belinus, do you doubt of that?
               If all the men at armes of Affrica,
               
               Of Asia likewise, will sufficient be,
               To presse the pompe of that vsurping mate:
               Assure thy selfe, thy kingdome shalbe thine,
               If Mahomet say I vnto the same:
               For were I sure to vanquish all our foes,
               And find such spoiles in ransacking their Tents,
               As neuer any Keisar did obtaine,
               Yet would I not set foote forth of this land:

               And Claramount go beare him companie,
               With King Arcastus, to the Citie walles.

               To make him shew vs in his drowsie dreame,
               What afterward should happen in his warres:
               Much talke he had, which now I haue forgot.
               But at the length, this surely was decreed,
               How that Alphonsus and Iphigina
               
               Should be conioynd in Iunoes sacred rites,
               Which when I heard, as one that did despise,
               That such a traytor should be sonne to me,
               I did rebuke my husband Amuracke.
               
               And since my words could take no better place,
               My sword with helpe of all Amazones,

               As though an oath can bridle so my minde,

                  re not breake a thousand oathes,
               For to eschew the danger imminent.
               Speake good Medea, tell that way to me,
               And I will do it, what so ere it be.
            
            
               Me.
               Then as already you haue well decreed,
               Packe to your countrey, and in readinesse,
               Select the armie of Amazones,
               
               When you haue done, march with your female troupe
               To Naples Towne, to succour Amuracke,
               
               And so by marriage of Iphigina,
               
               You soone shall driue the danger cleane away.
            
            
               Iphigi.
               So shall we soone eschew Caribdis lake,
               And headlong fall to Syllaes greedie gulph,
               I vowd before, and now do vow againe:
               Before I wedde Alphonsus, Ile be slaine.
            
            
               Me.
               In vaine it is, to striue against the streame,
               Fates must be followed, and the gods decree
               Must needs take place in euery kinde of cause.
               Therfore faire maide, bridle these brutish thoughts,
               
                  
And learne to follow what the fates assigne,
               When Saturne heard that Iuppiter his sonne
               Should driue him headlong from his heauenly seat,
               Downe to the bottome of the darke Auarne,
               
               He did command his mother presently,
               To do to death, the young and guiltlesse childe:
               But what of that, the mother 
                     •…
                  oathd in heart,
               For to commit so vile a massacre.
               Yea Ioue did liue, and as the fates did say,
               From heauenly seate, draue Saturne cleane away.
               What did auaile the Castle all of Steele,
               The which Acrisius caused to be made,
               To keepe his daughter Danae clogged in?
               She was with childe for all her Castles force,
               And by that child, Acrisius her sire,
               Was after slaine, so did the fates require.
               A thousand examples, I could bring hereof.
               But Marble stones needs no colouring,
               And that which euery one doth know for truth,
               Needs no examples to confirme the same.
               That which the fates appoint must happen so,
               Though heauenly Ioue, and all the Gods say no.
            
            
               Fau.
               
                  Iphigina, she sayth nought but truth,
               Fates must be followed in their iust decrees:
               And therefore setting all delayes aside,
               Come let vs wend vnto Amazone,
               
               And gather vp our forces out of hand.
            
            
               Iphi.
               Since Fausta wils, and fates do so command,
               
                  Iphigina will neuer it withstand.

               Did giue such credence to that forged tale,
               As that they lost their dearest liues thereby,

               Vnto Alphonsus, as straight shall appeare.

               My fellow Priests of Mahounds holy house,
               What can you iudge of these strange miracles,
               Which daily happen in this sacred seate?
               Drums rumble within.
               Harke what a rumbling ratleth in our cares.
               Cast flames of fire forth of the brazen Head.

Of Mahomet that God of peereles power.
               Nor can I tell with all the wit I haue,
               What Mahomet by these his signes doth craue.

               And fild her barnes with frutefull crops of corne,
               Since first in Priesthood I did lead my life:
               Yet in this time I neuer heard before,
               Such feareful sounds, nor saw such wondrous sights,
               Nor can I tell, with all the wit I haue,
               What Mahomet by these his signes doth craue.
            
            Speake out of the brazen Head.
            
               Ma.
               You cannot tell, nor will you seeke to know,
               Oh peruerse Priest, how carelesse are you waxt?
               As when my foes approach vnto my gates,
               You stand still talking of I cannot tell:
               Go packe you hence, and meete the Turkish kings,
               Which now are drawing to my Temple ward:
               Tell them from me, God Mahomet is dispos'd
               To prophesie no more to Amuracke,
               
               Since that his tongue is waxen now so free,

                     •…
                  ,
               Can make thee call this sentence backe againe,
               Bring not thy Priest into this dangerous state:
               For when the Turke doth heare of this repulse,
               We shall be sure to die the death therefore.

               Nor you be hurt in any kinde of wise.

               You Kings of Turkie, Mahomet our God,
               By sacred science, hauing notice that
               You were sent Legats from high Amuracke,
               
               Vnto this place, commaunded vs his Priests,
               That we should cause you make as mickle speed,
               As well you might, to heare for certaintie,
               Of that shall happen to your King and ye.
            
            
               Beli.
               For that intent we came into this place,
               And sithens that, the mightie Mahomet
               
               Is now at leisure for to tell the same,
               Let vs make haste and take time while we may:
               For mickle daunger hapneth through delay.

               Truth worthy king, and therfore you your selfe,
               With your companions, kneele before this place,
               And listen well what Mahomet doth say.

               Princes of Turkie, and Embassadors
               Of Amuracke, to mightie Mahomet,
               
               I needs must muse, that you which e

               Are now become so slacke in your affaires,
               As when you should with bloudie blade in hand,
               Be hacking he mes in thickest of your foes,
               You stand still loytering in the Turkish soyle.
               What know you not, how that it is decreed,
               By all the gods, and chiefly by my selfe
                     •…
                  
               
               That you with triumph should all Crowned bee:
               Make haste Kings, least when the fates do see,
               How carlesly you do neglect their words,
               
                  
They call a Counsell, and force Mahomet
               
               Against his will some other thing to set.
               Send Fabius backe to Amuracke againe,
               To haste him forwards in his enterprise:
               And march you on with all the troupes you haue,
               To Naples ward, to conquer Aragon.
               
               For if you stay, both you and all your men,
               Must needs be sent downe straight to Lymbo den.
            
            
               
                  2. Pri.
               Muse not braue kings at Mahomets discourse,
               For marke what he forth of that mouth doth say,
               Assure your selfe it needs must happen so.
               Therefore make hast, go mount you on your steeds,
               And set vpon Alphonsus presently.
               So shall you reape great honor for your paine:
               And scape the scourge, which els the Fates ordaine.
            
            Rise allvp.
            
               Beli.
               Then proud Alphonsus, looke thou to thy Crowne,
               
                  Belinus comes in glittring armor clad,
               All readie prest for to reuenge the wrong
               Which not long since, you offred vnto him.
               And since we haue God Mahound on our side:
               The victorie must needs to vs betide.
            
            
               Cla.
               Worthie Belinus, set such threats away,
               And let vs haste as fast as horse can trot,
               To set vpon presumptuous Aragon.
               
               You Fabius, hast as Mahound did commaund,
               To Amuracke, with all the speed you may.

               And thinking long till that we be in fight,
               
                  Belinus hastes to quaile Alphonsus might.
            
            Exeunt omnes.
            Strike vp alarum a while. Enter Carinus.

               Why then I doubt not but you can resolue
               Me of a question that I shall demaund.
            
            
               Duke.
               I that I can, what euer that it be.
            
            
               Cari.
               Then to be briefe, not twentie winters past
               When these my lims which withered are with age,
               Were in the prime and spring of all their youth,
               I still desirous as voong gallants be,
               To see the fashions of Arabia,
               
               My natiue soyle, and in this pilgrims weed,
               Began to trauell through vnkenned lands,
               Much ground I past, and many soyles I saw,
               But when my feete in Millain land I set,
               Such sumptuous triumphs daily there I saw,
               As neuer in my life I found the like.
               I pray good sir, what might the occasion bee:
               That made the Millains make such mirth and glee?
            
            
               Duk.
               This solemne ioy wherof you now do speak,
               Was not solemnized my friend in vaine.
               For at that time there came into the land,
               The happiest tidings that they ere did heare.
               For newes was brought vpon that solemne day,
               Vnto our Court, that Ferdinandus proud
               Was slaine himselfe, Carinus and his sonne
               Were banisht both for euer from Aragon:
               
               And for these happie newes that ioy was made.
            
            
               Cari.
               But what I pray did afterward become,
               Of old Carinus with his banisht sonne?
               What heare you nothing of them all this while?
            
            
               Du.
               Yes too too much, the Millain Duke may say.
               
                  Alphonsus first by secret meanes did get
               To be a souldier in Belinus warres:
               Wherein he did behaue himselfe so well,
               As that he got the Crowne of Aragon.
               
               Which being got, he dispossest also,
               
                  
The King Belinus which had fostered him:
               As for Carinus he is dead and gone,
               I would his sonne were his companion.
            
            
               Cari.
               A blister build vpon that traytors tongue,
               But for thy friendship which thou shewedst me,
               Take that of me, I frankly giue it thee.
               Stab him.
               Now will I haste to Naples with all speed,
               To see if Fortune will so fauour me,
               To view Alphonsus in his happie state.
            
            
               Exit Carinus.
            Enter Amuracke, Crocon King of Arabia, Faustus, King of Babilon, Fabius, with the Turkes Ganesaries.
            
               Amu.
               
                  Fabius come hither, what is that thou sayest?
               What did god Mahound prophecie to vs?
               Why do our Viceroyes wend vnto the warres,
               Before their king had notice of the same?
               What do they thinke to play bob foole with me?
               Or are they waxt so frolicke now of late,
               Since that they had the leading of our bands,
               As that they thinke that mightie Amuracke
               
               Dares do no other then to soothe them vp?
               Why speakest thou not? what fond or franticke fit
               Did make those carelesse Kings to venture it?
            
            
               Fa.
               Pardon deare Lord, no franticke fit at all,
               No frolicke vaine, nor no presumptuous mind,
               Did make your Viceroies take these wars in hand.
               But forst they were by Mahounds prophecie,
               To do the same, or else resolue to die.
            
            
               Amu.
               So sir, I heare you, but can scare beleeue
               That Mahomet would charge them go before
               Against Alphonsus with so small a troupe,
               Whose number farre exceeds king Xerxe
                        •…
                     
                   troupe,
            
            
               Fa.
               Yes Noble Lord, and more then that hee said,
               
                  
That ere that you with these your warlike men,
               Should come to bring your succour to the field:
               Belinus, Claramount, and Arcastus too,
               
               Should al be crownd with crownes of beaten gold,
               And bo

                  ne with triumphes round about their tēts.
            
            
               Amu.
               With triumph man, did Mahound tell them so
                     •…
                  
               
               Prouost go carrie Fabius presently,
               Vnto the Marshalsie, there let him rest,
               Clapt sure and safe in fetters all of steele,
               Till Amuracke discharge him from the same.
               For be he sure, vnles it happen so
               As he did say, Mahound did prophesie,
               By this my hand, forthwith the slaue shall die.
            
            Lay hold of Fabius, and make as though you carrie him out, Enter a souldier and say.
            
               Mess.
               Stay Prouost stay, let Fabius alone,
               More fitteth now, that euery lustie lad
               Be buckling on his helmet, then to stand
               In carrying souldiers to the Marshalsie.
            
            
               Amu.
               Why what art thou,
               That darest once presume,
               For to gainsay that Amuracke did bid?
            
            
               Messen.
               I am my Lord,
               The wretcheds man aliue:
               Borne vnderneath the Planet of mishap:
               Erewhile, a souldier of Belinus band
               But now.
            
            
               Amu.
               What now?
            
            
               Mess.
               The mirror of mishap:
               
                  
Whose Captaine is slaine, and all his armie dead:
               Onely excepted me vnhappie wretch.
            
            
               Amu.
               What newes is this, and is Belinus Slaine?
               Is this the Crowne which Mahomet did say,
               He should with triumph weare vpon his head?
               Is this the honour which that cursed god
               Did prophesie, should hapen to them all?
               Oh Dadalus, and wert thou now aliue,
               To fasten wings vpon high Amuracke,
               
               
                  Mahound should know, and that for certaintie,
               That turkish Kings can brooke no iniurie.
            
            
               Fabi.
               Tush tush my Lord,
               I wonder what you meane,
               Thus to exclaime against high Mahomet:
               
               Ile lay my life, that ere this day be past,
               You shall perceiue, his tidings all be waste.
            
            
               Amu.
               We shall perceiue, accursed Fabius,
               
               Suffice it not that thou hast bene the man,
               That first didst beate those bables in my braine,
               But that to helpe me forward in my greefe,
               Thou seekest to confirme so fowle a lie.
               Stab him.
               Go get thee hence, and tell thy trayterous King
               What gift you had, which did such tidings bring.
               And now my Lords, since nothing else will serue,
               Buckle your helmes, clap on your steeled coates,
               Mount on your steeds, take Launces in your hands,
               For Amuracke doth meane this very day,
               Proude Mahomet with weapons to assay.
            
            
               Messen.
               Mercie high Monarch, tis no time now
               To spend the day in such vaine threatnings,
               Against our god, the mightie Mahomet:
               
               
                  
More fitteth thee to place thy men at armes
               In battle ray, for to withstand your foes,
               Which now are drawing towards you with speed.
               Sound drummes within.
               Hark how their drummes with dub a dub do come,
               To armes high Lord, and set these trifles by:
               That you may set vpon them valiantly.
            
            
               Amu.
               And do they come you kings of Turkie?
               
               Now is the time, in which your warlike armes
               Must raise your names aboue the starrie skies:
               Call to your minde your predecessors acts,
               Whose martiall might, this many a hundred yeare,
               Did keepe those fearefull dogs in dread and awe,
               And let your weapons shew Alphonsus plaine,
               That though that they be clapped vp in clay,
               Yet there be branches sprung vp from those trees,
               In Turkish land, which brooke no iniuries.
               Besides the same, remember with your selues,
               What foes we haue, not mightie Tamberlaine,
               Nor souldiers trained vp amongst the warres,
               But fearefull bodies, pickt from their rurall flocke,
               Which till this time were wholy ignorant
               What weapons ment, or bloudie Mars doth craue.
               More would I say, but horses that be free,
               Do need no spur
                     •…
                   and souldiers which themselues
               Long and desire to buckle with the foe,
               Do need no words to egge them to the same.
               Enter Alphonsus, with a Canapie carried ouer him by three Lords, hauing ouer each corner a Kings head, crowned with him, Albinius, Laelius, Miles, with Crownes on their heads, and their souldiers.
               Besides the same, behold whereas our foes
               Are marching towards vs most speedilie.
               
                  
Courage my Lords, ours is the victorie.
            
            
               Alph.
               Thou Pagan dog how darst thou be so bold
               To set thy foote within Alphonsus land?
               What art thou come to view thy wretched kings,
               Whose traiterous heads bedeckt my tents so well?
               Or else thou hearing that on top thereof,
               There is a place left vacant, art thou come
               To haue thy head possesse the highest seate?
               If it be so, lie downe, and this my sword
               Shall presently that honor thee affoord.
               If not, pack hence, or by the heauens I vow,
               Both thou and thine shall verie soone perceiue,
               That he that seekes to moue my patience,
               Must yeeld his life to thee for recompence.
            
            
               Amu.
               Why proud Alphonsus, thinkst thou Amurack
               
               Whose mightie force doth terrefie the Gods,
               Can ere be found to turne his heeles and flie
               Away for feare, from such a boy as thou?
               No no, although that Mars this mickle while
               Hath fortified thy weake and feeble arme,
               And Fortune oft hath viewd with friendly face,
               Thy armies marching victors from the field,
               Yet at the presence of high Amuracke,
               
               Fortune shall change, and Mars that God of might
               Shall succour me, and leaue Alphonsus quight.
            
            
               Alphon.
               Pagan I say, thou greatly art deceiu'd,
               I clap vp Fortune in a cage of gold,
               To make her turne her wheele as I thinke best.
               And as for Mars whom you do say will change,
               He moping sits behind the kitchin doore,
               Prest at commaund of euery Skullians mouth
                     •…
                  
               
               Who dares not stir, nor once to moue a whit
               For feare Alphonsus then should stomack it.
            
            
               Amu.
               Blasphemous dog, I wonder that the earth
               Doth cease from renting vnderneath thy feete,
               
                  
What froward fortune hapned on your side:
               I hope your king in safetie doth abide?
            
            
               Cro.
               I noble madam, Amurack doth liue:
               And long I hope he shall enioy his life.
               But yet I feare, vnles more succour come,
               We shall both loose our king and soueraigne.
            
            
               Fau.
               How so king Crocon, dost thou speak in iest?
               To proue if Fausta would lament his death?
               Or else hath any thing hapt him amis?
               Speake quickly Crocon what the cause might be,
               That thou dost vtter forth these words to me?
            
            
               Cro.
               Then worthie Fausta know, that Amuracke
               
               Our mightie king, and your approued spowse,
               Prickt with desire of euerlasting fame,
               As he was pressing in the thickest rankes
               Of Aragonians, was with much adoo
               At length tooke prisoner, by Alphonsus hands.
               So that vnles you succour soone do bring,
               You loose your spowse, and we shall want our king.
            
            
               Iphi.
               Oh haples hap, oh dire and cruell fate!
               What iniurie hath Amuracke my sire
               Done to the Gods, which now I know are wrath?
               Although vniustly and without a cause.
               For well I wot, not any other king
               Which now doth liue, or since the world begun
               Did sway a scepter, had a greater care
               To please the Gods, then mightie Amuracke.
               
               And for to quite our fathers great good will,
               Seeke they thu

                   basely all his fame to spill.

                  Iphigina, leaue off these wofull tunes,
               It is not words can cure and ease this wound:
               But warlike swords, not teares, but sturdie speares:
               High Amuracke is prisoner to our foes.
               What then? thinke you that our Amazones
               
               Ioynd with the forces of the Turkish troupe,
               
                  
Are not sufficient for to set him free?
               Yes daughter yes, I meane not for to sleepe,
               Vntill he is free, or we him company keepe.
               March on my mates.
            
            Exeunt omnes.
            Strike vp alarum, flie Alphonsus, follow Iphigina and say.
            
               Iphi.
               How now Alphonsus, you which neuer yet
               Could meete your equall in the feates of armes,
               How haps it now that in such sudden sort
               You flie the presence of a sillie maide?
               What haue you found mine arme of such a force,
               As that you thinke your bodie ouerweake
               For to withstand the furie of my blowes?
               Or do you else disdaine to fight with me:
               For staining of your high nobilitie?
            
            
               Alp.
               No daintie dame, I wold not haue thee think
               That euer thou or any other wight,
               Shall liue to see Alphnosus flie the field
               From any king or Keisar who some ere,
               First will I die in thickest of my fo,
               Before I will disbase mine honour so.
               Nor do I scorne thou goddes for to staine
               My prowes with thee, although it be a shame
               For knights to combat with the female sect.
               But loue sweete mouse hath so benumbd my wit,
               That though I would, I must refraine from it.
            
            
               Iphi.
               I thought as much when first I came to wars,
               Your noble acts were fitter to be writ
               Within the Tables of dame Venus sun,
               Then in God Mars his warlike registers.
               When as your Lords are hacking helm es abroad,
               And make their speares to shiuer in the aire,
               Your mind is busied in fond Cupids toyes.

               We came to fight, and not to loue I trow.
            
            
               Alph.
               Nay virgin stay, and if thou wilt vouchsafe
               To entertaine Alphonsus simple sute,
               Thou shalt ere long be Monarch of the world:
               All christned kings, with all your Pagan dogs
               Shall bend their knees vnto Iphigina.
               
               The Indian soyle shalbe thine at command,
               Where euery step thou settest on the ground,
               Shall be receiued on the golden mines.
               Rich Pactolus that riuer of account,
               Which doth descend from top of Tiuole mount,
               Shall be thine owne, and all the world beside:
               If you will graunt to be Alphonsus bride.
            
            
               Iphi.
               
                  Alphonsus bride? nay villain do not thinke
               That fame or riches can so rule my thoughts,
               As for to make me loue and fancie him
               Whom I do hate, and in such sort despise,
               As if my death could bring to passe his baine:
               I would not long from Plutoes port remaine.
            
            
               Alph.
               Nay then proud pecock since thou art so stou
                     •…
                  ,
               As that intreatie will not moue thy minde
               For to consent to be my wedded spowse,
               Thou shalt in spite of Gods and Fortune too,
               Serue high. Alphonsus as a concubine.
            
            
               Iphi.
               Ile rather die then euer that shall hap.
            
            
               Alphon.
               And thou shalt die vnles it come to pas.
            
            
               Alphonsus and Iphigina fight, Iphigina flie, follow Alphonsus. Strike vp alarum. Enter Alphonsus with his rapier, Albinius, Laelius, Miles with their souldiers. Amurack, Fausta, Iphigina, Crocon and Faustus all bounde with their 
                  •…
               ands behind them, Amuracke looke angerly on Fausta.
            
               
               Enter Medea, and say.
            
               Med.
               Nay Amurack this is no time to iarre,
               Although thy wife did in her franticke moode
               Vse speeches which might better haue bene sparde,
               Yet do thou not iudge the same time to be
               A season to requite that iniurie:
               More fitteth thee with all the wit thou hast,
               To call to mind which way thou maist release
               Thy selfe, thy wife, and faire Iphigina,
               
               Forth of the power of stout Alphonsus hands.
               For well I wot, since first you breathed breath,
               You neuer were so nie the snares of death.
               Now Amurack, 
                  
                     •…
                  our high and kingly seate,
               Your ro
                     •…
                  all scepter, and your stately Crowne,
               Your mightie Countrey, and your men at armes,
               Be conquered all, and can no succour bring.
               Put then no trust in these same paltrie toyes:
               But call to mind that thou a prisoner art:
               Clapt vp in chaines, whose life and deaths depends
               Vpon the hands of thy most mortall foe.
               Then take thou heed that what some ere he say,
               Thou doest not once presume for to gainsay.
            
            
               Amu.
               Away you foole, thinke you your cursed-charmes
               Can bridle so the mind of Amuracke,
               
               As that he will stand croaching to his foe?
               No no, be sure that if that beggers brat
               Do dare but once to contrary my will,
               Ile make him soone in heart for to repent,
               That ere such words gainst Amuracke he spent.
            
            
               Med.
               Then since thou dost disdaine my good aduise,
               Looke to thy selfe, and if you fare amis
               
                  
Remember that Medea counsell gaue,
               Which might you safe from all those perils saue.
               But Fausta you, as well you haue begun,
               Beware you follow still your friends aduise.
               If that Alphonsus do desire of thee
               To haue your daughter for his wedded spowse,
               Beware you do not once the same gainsay:
               Vnles with death he do your rashnes pay.
            
            
               Fau.
               No worthie wight, first Fausta means to die,
               Before Alphonsus she will contrarie.
            
            
               Med.
               Why then farwell, but you Iphigina,
               
               Beware you do not ouersqueamish wax,
               When as your mother giueth her consent.
            
            
               Iphi.
               The Gods forbid that ere I should gainsay
               That which Medea bids me to obay.
            
            Exit Medea.
            
            Rise vp Alphonsus out of his chaire, who all this while hath bene talking to Albinius, and say.
            
               Al.
               Now Amurack the proud blasphemous dogs
               (For so 
                     •…
                  ou termed vs) which did brall and raile
               Against God Mars, and fickle Fortunes wheele,
               Haue got the gole for all your solemne praiers:
               Your selfe are prisoner, which as then did thinke
               That all the forces of the triple world,
               Were insufficient to fulfill the same.
               How like you this? is Fortune of such might,
               Or hath God Mars such force or power diuine,
               As that he can with all the power he hath,
               Set thee and thine forth of Alphonsus hands?
               I do not thinke but that your hopes so small,
               As that you would with verie willing mind,
               Yeeld for my spowse the faire Iphigina,
               
               On that condition, that without delay,
               
                  Fausta and you may scotfree scape away.
            
            
               Amu.
               What thinkst thou vilain that high Amurack
               
               
                  
Beares such a minde, as for the feare of death,
               Heele yeeld his daughter, yea his onely ioy,
               Into the hands of such a dunghill Knight?
               No traytor no, for as now I lie
               Clapt vp in Irons, and with bolts of steele:
               Yet do there lurke within the Turkish soyle,
               Such troupes of souldiers, that with small ado,
               Theile set me scotfree from your men and you.
            
            
               Alp.
               Villain sayest thou, traitor &amp; dunghil knight,
               Now by the heauens, since that thou dost denie,
               For to fulfill that which in gentle wise
               
                  Alphonsus craues, both thou and all thy traine
               Shall with your liues requite that iniurie.
               
                  Albinius lay holde of Amuracke,
               
               And carrie him to prison presently,
               There to remaine vntill I do returne
               Into my tent, for by high Ioue I vowe,
               Vnles he waxe more calmer out of hand,
               His head amongst his fellow Kings shall stand.
            
            
               Albinius carrie Amuracke forth, who as he is a going, must say.
            
               Amu.
               No villaine, thinke not that the feare of death
               Shall make me calmer while I draw my breath.
            
            
               Alphon.
               Now Laelius, take you Iphigina,
               
               Her mother Fausta, with these other Kings,
               And put them into prisons seuerally:
               For Amuracks stout stomacke shall vndo,
               Both he himselfe and all his other crew.
            
            Fausta kneele downe.
            
               Fau.
               Oh sacred Prince, if that the salt-brine teares,
               Distilling downe poore Faustas withered cheekes,
            
            
               
Alphonsus and Albinius go toward Carinus, Alphonsus stand looking on Carinus, Carinus say.
            
            
               Cari.
               What nere a word Alphonsus, art thou dumb?
               O
                     •…
                   d
                     •…
                  th my presence so perturbe thy minde,
               That for because I come in Pilgrims weed,
               You thinke each word which you do spend to me
               A great disgrace vnto your name to be?
               Why speakest thou not? if that my place you craue,
               I will be gone and you my place shall haue.
            
            
               Alph.
               Nay father stay, the Gods of heauen forbid,
               That ere Alphonsus should desire or wish
               To haue his absence whom he doth account
               To be the Loadstone of his life.
               What though the fates and fortune both in one,
               Haue bene content to call your louing sonne,
               From beggers state, vnto this princely seate,
               Should I therefore disdaine my aged sire?
               No first both Crowne and life I will detest,
               Before such venome breed within my brest.
               What erst I did, the sudden ioy I tooke,
               To see Carinus in such happie state,
               Did make me do, and nothing else at all,
               High Ioue himselfe do I to witnes call.
            
            
               Cari.
               These words are vaine, I knew as much before:
               But yet Alphonsus I must wonder needs,
               That you whose yeares are proue to Cupids snares,
               Can suffer such a Goddes as this dame,
               Thus for to shead such store of Christall teares.
               Beleeue me sonne, although my yeares be spent,
               Her sighes and sobs in twaine my heart do rent.
            
            
               Alph.
               Like power deare father had she ouer me,
               Vntill for loue, I looking to receiue
               Loue backe againe, not onely was denied,
               But also taunted in most spightfull sort:
               
                  
Which made me loathe that which I erst did loue,
               As she her selfe, with all her friends shall proue.
            
            
               Cari.
               How now Alphonsus, you which haue so lōg
               Bene trained vp in bloudie broyles of Mars,
               
               What know you not, that Castles are not wonne
               At first assault, and women are not wooed
               When first their suters profer loue to them:
               As for my part, I should account that maide
               A wanton wench, vnconstant lewde and light,
               That yeelds the field, before she venture fight.
               Especially vnto her mortall foe,
               As you were then vnto Iphigina.
               
               But for because I see you fitter are
               To enter Lists and combat with your foes,
               Then court faire Ladyes in God Cupids tents,
               
                  Carinus meanes, your spokesman for to bee,
               And if that she consent, you shall agree.
            
            
               Alphon.
               What you commaund,
               
                  Alphonsus must not flie:
               Though otherwise perhaps he would denie.
            
            
               Cari.
               Then daintie damsell stint these trickling teares,
               Cease sighes and sobs, yea make a merrie cheare,
               Your pardon is already purchased:
               So that you be not ouer curious
               In granting to Alphonsus iust demand.
            
            
               Iphi.
               Thankes mightie Prince, no curioser ile bee,
               Then doth become a maide of my degree.
            
            
               Cari.
               The Gods forbid that ere Carinus tongue
               Should go about to make a mayd consent
               Vnto the thing which modestie denies:
               That which I aske, is neither hurt to thee,
               Danger to parents, nor disgrace to friends,
               But good and honest, and will profit bring,
               To thee and those which leane vnto that thing.
               
                  
And that is this, since first Alphonsus eyes,
               Did hap to glaunce vpon your heauenly hew,
               And saw the rare perfection of the same,
               He hath desired to become your spowse.
               Now if you will vnto the same agree,
               I dare assure you, that you shall be free.
            
            
               Iph.
               Pardon deare Lord, the world goes very hard,
               When women kinde are forced for to wooe,
               If that your sonne had loued me so well,
               Why did he not informe me of the same?
            
            
               Ca.
               Why did he not? what haue you clean forgot
               What ample profers he did make to you,
               When hand to hand he did encounter you?
            
            
               Iphi.
               No worthy sir, I haue not it forgot,
               But Cupid cannot enter in the brest,
               Where Mars before had tooke possession:
               That was no time to talke of Venus games,
               When all our fellowes were pressed in the warres.
            
            
               Cari.
               Well, let that passe, now canst thou be content
               To loue Alphonsus, and become his spowse?
            
            
               Iphi.
               I if the high Alphonsus could vouchsafe
               To entertaine me as his wedded spowse.
            
            
               Alphon.
               If that he could? what dost thou doubt of that
               
                  Iason did iet when as he had obtaind,
               The golden fleece by wise Medeas art,
               The Greekes reioyced when they had subdued
               The famous bulwarkes of most stately Troy,
               
               But all their mirth was nothing in respect
