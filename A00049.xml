            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            I sing what most I wish; what's that? to thriue,
            Without least wrong to any man aliue:
            A gratefull Worke to all, to young and old,
            That seeke to get or to increase their gold:
            But why goes Death then with this thriftie traine?
            Because I hold, it is the greatest gaine
            To die well: For we no man truely call
            Or rich, or happie, till his Funerall.

               But to the Muses deare and noble friend,
               Who, as in Honour, seekes to thriue in Grace:
               Who, truly nob

                  r his Place is onely honoured:
               Whom should the Muses more desire to grace,
               Then whom they haue vp in their Bosomes bred,

               Thy treasure vp in heau'n; thus thou dost gaine:
               By giuing of some fading goods away,
               
                  True honour, which for euer shall remaine:

               And if thou please to reade Deaths Meditation,

            MEDITATION 1.
            Of Frugality, or Thrift.
            
               MY Muse now fares like some plaine country Mayd,
               Walking in fairest Garden for delight,
               With all variety and choyce arrayd,
               Of herbs and flowers to please the Sent &amp; Sight;
               Who with the choycest flowers doth first bedight
               White silken pillowes of her bosome faire;
               But after their rich colours her inuite,
               With them to decke her head and golden haire,
               That as she them adornes, so they may all begay her.
            
            
               For when Brides garden first I entered
               Of Graces, for delightfull meditation,
               
               I onely some choyce Flowers gathered,
               For holy Life, and heau'nly Contemplation:
               
               But passing foorth with choyce of Delectation,
               Such sweet and rich variety I find,
               Fit to adorne my life and conuersation,
               
               Out of those pleasant knots I cannot wind,
               Which with new choyce of flowres &amp; herbs delight my mind.
            
            
               But amongst all the fragrant herbes and flowers,
               That in the Graces garden doe abound,
               I find none of more sou'raigne grace and powers,
               Than this of Thrift, which next I do propound:
               An herbe indeed that's hardly to be found,
               Because she most what in a corner growes,
               And matteth low vpon the fattest ground,
               And many her mistake for likely showes,
               But scarce one of an hundred that her truly knowes.
            
            
               
               Oh heau'nly Muse! that taught the shepherds swaine,
               
               (As he his flockes was following great with yong,
               To feed them on faire Iordans flowrie plaine)
               Diuinest skill in Tunes and heau'nly Song;
               
               With some such holy Fury touch my tong,
               Whilst I now of Frugality do sing;
               Who, though she little doth to me belong,
               Yet if thou help
                     •
                   to touch my harsher string,
               I may teach some her practice, whilst her praise I ring.
            
            
               She is that Vertue, or that golden Mea

               One of the highest Titles due to man doth gaine.
            
            
               And such indeed haue onely right fruition
               Of all such fruits, as God to man doth send;
               Who prudently here weighing their condition,
               Preserue the Substance, and the fruits do spend:
               Who flockes and cattell diligently tend,
               Grasse, Vines and Corn that in the fields do grow,
               To them their lambes for clothing, Wooll will lend;
               From Goats and Kine great store of milke shal flow,
               To feed their houshold, and large gifts abroad bestow.
            
            
               There is a Thrift in Substance, and in Grace;
               
               One temporall, the other spirituall:
               
               They that the one, without the other, trace,
               Do neither of them find perpetuall:
               God is of both the Cause effectuall;

               As all spirituall Thrift from him doth flow,
               So, by his blessing all in substance thriue and grow.
            
            
               
               This did theLaban

                     •
                   doth fauour gaine,
               Because all well succeeds that he doth wield:
               By heau'ns sweet influence the earth her fruits doth yeeld.
            
            
               
                  Thrift eldest daughter is of Temperance,
               
               By Prudence nursed in her tender yeeres,
               But when to riper yeeres she doth aduance,
               A Standard vnder Fortitude she beares:
               Shee, graced by these three most noble Peeres,
               
               By their aduice directs her actions right,
               By Temperance she feedes, and cloathing weares;
               By Prudence store prouides with wise foresight;
               By Fortitude 'gainst Fortunes blasts she stands vpright.
            
            
               She moderateth all delights and pleasure,
               Not that she vs forbids all sports or play,
               But makes vs recreate our selues with measure,
               That from our selues they take vs not away:
               As he that moderates, vpon the way
               His 
                     •
                  iercer Steed, is said to vse him right;
               Not he that let's him runne about and stray:
               So onely he doth pleasures vse aright,
               That serues not them, but makes them serue to his delight.
            
            
               For she not onely is a Moderation
               
               In meates, and what to clothing doth pertaine,
               But she eke moderates our recreation,
               Lest for it we do lose a greater gaine:
               She doth too much of any thing refraine,
               And cuts off all luxurious vaine expence.
               If thou to thrift and riches wouldst attaine
               Here, seeke not to increase and raise thy rents,
               But moderate Desire, and vaine Concupiscence.
            
            
               
               I euer from Frugalitie exclude
               All sordid basenesse, want of aliment,
               She out of plenty alwaies doth seclude
               Some few things necessary for Content:
               For to be frugall and magnificent,
               
               May both well in a prudent man combine,
               Else Thrift no daughter is of Temperment;
               
               I onely those for frugall men define,
               Who vse their store, but suffer it not to decline.
            
            
               I oft do find in some a simulation,
               Or ostentation of Frugality;
               
               When great men follow thriftie imitation
               Of those, which are of meaner qualitie:
               And this may be too much Rusticitie,
               
               Be it in Diet, Vessels, Ornament;
               
               Best rule for Thrift in all, is Modesty:
               
               For where it meetes with one that's prouident,
               Hee's temp'rate, modest, frugall and magnificent.
            
            
               But the most deare and faithfull friend to Thrift,
               
               Is carefull Husbandry, and Prouidence:
               
               This is the thriuing Vertue, which is grift
               On stocke of Labour, Care, and Diligence.
               
               This brings in sewell to Magnificence,
               And like good huswife fetcheth food from farre.
               The thriftie handmaid of Beneficence,
               In Summer for the Winter taketh care;
               And, ere she builds, Materials doth abroad prepare.

               Vnlike the frugall Pismire, which still brings
               In new prouision, ere she spend her old:
               Like many youthfull Gallants, who their gold,
               In summer of their youth do sport away;
               But when their coyne is spent, and land is sold,

                   cause of their decay:
               But prudent Thrift foresees and shunnes such euill day.
            
            
               
               By ciuill Law, the madde and prodigall
               
               Are interdicted the administration
               Of their owne Goods; and haue Curators all,
               To manage their estate in frugall fashion:
               And so long must they both abide Curation;
               
               The furious till he gets his wits againe,
               The Prodigall, till he to emendation
               Doth of his Manners and his Thrift attaine:
               'Tis good for Common-wealth, none spend his state in vaine.
            
            
               One, Thrift vnto the Temples doth compare
               Amongst the Heathen, which, most sure Asyle,
               
               And Sanctuaries for all Debtors were:
               Another likes a thrifty man, ere-while,
               To ground wel compast, and wel till'd with toyle:
               For as such lands grow foule by slothfulnesse,
               But fruitfull, where the plough doth stir the soyle:
               So men grow grosse and foule by Idlenesse,
               
               But pure and healthfull by laborious Thriftinesse.
               
            
            
               Heathen, such fruitfull frugall men compare
               Vnto the gods, who had so little need,
               Though they had all, that they it all could spare
               To mortals, who did here their blessings need:
               Farre otherwise 'tis with our rich-mens breed;
               They nothing spare, but spend eu'n all and more,
               Their Flesh and Lusts luxuriously to feed:
               Thus they, in plenty swimming, are but poore,
               When those that haue but little, yet haue greater store.
            
            
               This their rich misery doth not proceed
               From any fault, that is in outward store,
               
               But from Lusts and Cupidities which breed
               In Soule and Body, as I said before:
               Like some in fits of Agues, who the more
               Coole Beere they drink, the more they do desire,
               Their drinking thirst increaseth: He therefore
               Must purge the humours, cause of all this Fire,
               Else drinke till he burst, he growes within the drier.
            
            
               
               Me thinkes I rightly may this Thrift compare
               Vnto the seu'n 
                     •
                  at Kine on Nylus shore,
               Or those seu'n goodly 
                     
                        •
                     ares of Corne, which were
               To Egypts Monarch signes of Thrift and store:
               The blasted eares, and Bullockes leane and poore,
               I liken vnto Prodigality:
               
               Who all the fruits deuowers vp, and more,
               That are prouided by Frugality:
               
               Thus she with her owne bowels feeds her enemy.
            
            
               As when the Ayer suckes immoderatly
               Vp moysture from the ground, the clouds do fall
               From thence againe on Earth most lauishly:
               Eu'n so, when Misers here do licke vp all,
               For to enrich their heyers therewithall,
               Soone as the long-expected day doth come
               Of their most welcome, tearelesse funerall,
               Their wealth all lauishly about doth run,
               Till their rich cloud be spent, and they be quite vndone.
            
            
               It is most terrible, prodigious,
               To see an Earthquake, with dread violence,
               Swallow a Country, City, Towne, or House;
               Yet Prodigals, oft by profuse expence,
               Do swallow Towers, Houses, Farms and Rents:
               Then they, saith one, them vomit vp againe,
               Not truly sell them; for they haue long since
               Them spent in drinking, lusts and pleasures vaine;
               They onely now are faint to spue them out for paine.
            
            
               Many good precepts find I of the wise,
               Vs to instruct in true Frugality;
               
               But Dauid doth the onely way aduise,
               In his most sweet diuinest Psalmody:
               He shall haue plenty and prosperity,
               That feares the Lord, and scatters to the poore,
               His name be blessed to Posterity.
               He that disperseth shall haue greater store:
               For goods-disposer giues him all his wealth therefore.
            
            
               
               
                  Abels first frugall man I of do reade,
               Who gaue the fairest firstlings of his Flockes,
               Because there was no poore that then had need,
               To him that gaue him all his store and stockes.
               This gaue to Isaac great and castie Shockes,
               When in one yeere he reapt an hundred-fold:
               
                  Iacob, that went out with a staffe, now stockes
               All Shechims country with his Herd and Fold:
               The land of Canaan scarce can all his substance hold.
            
            
               The Heathen say, that heau'nly Prouidence
               
               To mortals here for labours Blessings sell:
               And therefore do require all diligence
               Of all, that would haue all things prosper well.
               Of Abstinence and Continence some tell,
               That giue a man with little, much content;
               Which of anothers inch will make an ell,
               By whom nought lauishly on Lusts is spent,
               But onely needfull wants of Nature to content.

               Than they that seeke a world of wealth to gaine,

               But we ought onely eate and drinke to liue;
               To liue to feed, is to be like a beast:
               Who would in reason more, than sense, be thriue,

                  Xantippe's said once Socrates too blame,

               Auoyding alwaies costly preparation:

               If, as they seeme, they be our friends indeed,

               They make a shew: let's to our selues take heed,

               Oh what a happinesse it is to liue,
               And do much good, without offence, to all!

               Is not an end, but change of Misery:
               
               The fault is in the Mind, (not in the Fate,)
               
               Which is the same in wealth and pouerty:
               
               Who onely mind change and variety,
               
               Liue ill, because they still begin to liue:
               They rightly here inioy prosperity,
               That so much pleasure to their Bodies giue,
               As they not for, but in the Body sought to liue.
            
            
               Happy is he, who neuer saw that one
               With whom he would exchange his meane estate;
               Most miserable, who to that are come,
               They things, which were superfluous of late,
               Haue now made necessary to their state:
               Such are eu'n slaues, not masters of their pleasure;
               They loue their ills, which is the hardest fate.
               Alas! there is no remedy nor measure
               Of Vices, when as men esteeme them as a treasure.
            
            
               No good befals a man vnder the Sunne,
               The which his mind is not prepar'd to lose:
               No losse more easie is to any one,
               Than of the things he hath no need to vse:
               He's neuer poore, who Natures rules doth chuse;
               Nor rich, that liueth by Opinion:
               
               
                  Natures desires be finite; boundlesse those,
               That false Opinion depend vpon,
               Loathing no Sallet: Hunger likes an Onion.
               
            
            
               Sure he is best, to whom with sparing hand,
               God giues sufficient, let him wish no more:
               In need of things superfluous to stand,
               Is miserable want, in greatest store.
               
               Excesse oppresseth many, who before
               With little could haue liu'd and beene content:
               These, though they haue enough, yet stil be poore,

               Who is not made in Husbandry to sweat,
               May sweat in Arts or Lawes politicall;
               'Tis fit all earne their bread, before they eate:
               Nothing is more expensiue, prodigall,
               Than to haue nothing here to doe at all:
               Want of employment, Ease, and Idlenesse,
               Haue caus'd more noble Houses here to fall,
               Than Fortunes blasts, or Enuies bitternesse.
               
               Let him not liue to spend, that nothing doth professe.
            
            
               Then let him neuer liue, that doth professe
               What's worse than nothing, basest Vsury:
               
               Herein is certaine profit, I confesse,
               But alwaies with anothers misery:
               
               Is this the vertue of Frugality?
               
               By others losses to increase our store?
               Then so is rapine, theft, and robbery,
               
               
                  Selling of Iustice, which oft bring in more,
               Than all the frugall Trades I named haue before.
            
            
               Since Nature with so little is content,
               Who here would vse vnlawfull Arts for gaine?
               We are but Stewards here of what is sent,
               If we our Talents vse aright to gaine,
               We twice as many shall of God obtaine:
               But if to hide them in the earth we chuse,
               Or spend them on our Lusts and Pleasures vaine,
               They shall be tane from vs, who them abuse,
               And giu'n to such as shall them to Gods glory vse.
            
            
               But I so worldly Thrift haue followed,
               That I forgotten haue to thriue in Grace,
               
               And as it in the world is practised,
               Must put her off vnto the second place:
               For I so neere haue finished my race,
               I must deferre this to another time:
               God grant we may them both aright imbrace.
               Now, like good husbands, knocke we off betime,
               And be at worke to morrow in the mornings prime.
            
            
               
               BEhold! how Birds for morrow take no care;
               Secure, God will due food for them prepare:
               Can woorthlesse Birds be confident of meate?
               And is a farthing-Sparrowes Faith so great,
               She knowes, but by Gods will, she cannot fall?
               And shall Gods sonnes, Christs images, once call
               In doubt their Makers will, to do then good?
               No sure: who lends them life, will giue them food.

            Of Prouidence.
            
               THe frugall Husband, which I erst describ'd,
               So soone as Titan with his glistring Beames,
               Begilds the locks of stately Pines, which hide
               The tops of Mountaines from his hotter gleames;
               Walkes foorth amongst his cattell, flocks &amp; teames,
               
               His Land to open to Sunnes mellowing heate,
               And feed his Herds along the siluer streames,
               To drinke and bathe, when they their fil haue eate,
               That fat they him may feed, that now prouides them meate.
            
            
               Thus early rising; as the Prouerbe sayes,
               Brings Thrift in body, in estate, and mind;
               
               The early riser spends in health his dayes,
               And by his diligence doth plenty find;
               And in the morning better is inclin'd
               To Prayer, and diuinest Meditation:
               Thus, in a three-fold Cord, he Thrift doth wind;
               He driueth Slouth farre from his habitation,
               His Soule in Grace, his Body

               For these respects the Husbands country life

               For though Thrift in estate these oft befall;
               And Thrift in Grace, in many there we finde,
               Yet scarce a strong sound Body 'mongst them all,

               Of these foure I would sing, and first of Prouidence.
               
            
            
               Oh! thou by whose most pow'rfull onely Word,
               
               
                  All was of nothing made and finished,
               And of this All, mad'st man the little Lord,
               That by him All might well be ordered:
               Who hayers of our head hast numbred,
               
               Nor lettest the least Sparrow fall to ground,
               
               But as thou hast before determined,
               Make heauenly Wisedome in mine heart abound,
               That I may wade, not drowne, in Prouidence profound.
            
            
               There is Diuine and humane Prouidence,
               
               
                  Diuine is infinite, vnlimited
               Transcending Reason, more than Reason Sense,
               
               And may to glorious Sunne be likened:
               The Stars who thence their light haue borrowed,
               Doth humane Prouidence resemble right,
               Which by diuine is aye enlightened,
               And though like Starres it oft appeareth bright,
               Yet when the heau'nly shines, it is obscured quite.

               As we are men, we power haue to will,
               As men corrupt, we alwayes will amisse,
               As borne againe, to good we haue a will.
               Thus Nature Freewill giues, Sinne bends to ill;
               
               
                  Grace vnto Good: But now I seeme to stray
               From Prouidence diuine, to mans freewill,
               
               But this as needfull shew I by the way,
               How Prouidence doth voluntary agents sway.
            
            
               Her Nature yet more plaine to vnderstand,
               We must conceiue the worlds great Marischall,
               
               As he made all things by his mighty hand,
               So he for euer them disposeth all
               By Prouidence; not onely generall,
               
               By which the Spheres in their due motions ride,
               And Summer and the winter seasons fall,
               But as he by his speciall doth guide
               And orders euery thing, that doth on earth betide.
            
            
               And this we call diuine Necessitie,
               
               Free from Coaction, which doth all dispose
               To proper ends, yet with free liberty
               
               Of Will, the things we doe to leaue or choose:
               Thus in respect of God, that future knowes
               As present, all effects are necessary,
               
               And, in respect of second causes those,
               To vs contingent are: Last voluntary,
               
               As they respect mans will, and motion arbitrary.

                  uell bondages to see,
               He went forth with a free and willing mind;
               
               Lo thus in this example all the three,
               
                  Diuine foresight, man's will, and Chance in one agree:
            
            
               
               And therefore when of Fortune you do reade,
               With reference to man it vnderstand,
               Who most to the euent of things take heed,
               Not to the Cause, Gods most Almighty hand:
               Else Chance and Prouidence can neuer stand
               Together in th' Almighties gouernment;
               Who being Cause of all he doth command,
               Them orders all vnto a sure euent,
               Though farre aboue mans limited intendemen
                     •
                  .
            
            
               Of things indeed which seeme by chance to be,
               The Order, Cause, Necessity and end
               
               Are hid, in Gods close Counsell and Decree:
               
               We onely able are to apprehend
               By the euent, how God doth them intend:
               Thus Clerk's a threefold working doe obserue
               Of Prouidence; which far their reach transcend,
               And yet they all to one same end doe serue,
               To shew Gods glory, and his creatures to preserue.
            
            
               Thus meanes and second causes she doth vse,
               Oft workes without, by power immediate,
               
               And oft to worke against meanes she doth chuse:
               Two last men call Necessity or Fate,
               
               Because the Cause they can not calculate:
               (Oh richest Wisedome, Knowledge without bound
               Of the Almighty! without time, or Date,
               Thy Iudgements no man able is to 
                     •
                  ound,
               Beyond all mens conceit, thy counsels are profound.)
            
            
               Like this is that Philosophers assigne
               To Counsell, Nature, Chance and Prouidence;
               
               By Counsell, they meant Will and Reasons line;
               By Nature, force of heau'nly influence;
               By Chance, when they below beheld euents,
               
               But not their Cause: Last when some Grace did fall
               Past Natures, Chance, and Counsels euidence,
               That Speciall Prouidence diuine they call,
               Not but they vnderstood she had her 
                     
                        •
                     and in all.
            
            
               
               Sweet fruit of Prouidence to be perswaded,
               That all below is ordered by Gods hand,
               Nothing by Chance: Thus when we are inuaded
               By Foes, Death, Hell, we most vndanted stand:
               We, God prime cause of all things vnderstand,
               Respecting yet inferiour in their place,
               Which alwayes wait vpon the first's command,
               And all are to the glory of his grace,
               
               Whereby God his elect doth aye in loue embrace.
            
            
               Oh what inestimable quietnesse!
               From hence ariseth to a godly minde,
               Though euils without number him oppresse,
               Which like so many Deaths he then doth finde,
               Knowing not how his wretched selfe to winde
               From Cruelty, which him fast followeth,
               And doth so fast with cords and fetters binde,
               That eu'ry minute threateneth his Death;
               And scarcely suffers him to draw his languid breath.
            
            
               Yet if this Light of heau'nly Prouidence
               
               Shines to his Soule; then all Anxiety,
               Feare, Care, Distrust, are banisht quite frō thence,
               And he releeu'd in all extremity:
               Then knowes he that one gracious Maiesty,
               Heere by his power so directeth all,
               By wisedome rules, and by his Bonity
               Disposeth so, that nothing euer shall,
               But for Gods glory and his owne good him befall.
            
            
               To fleshes obloquy, some giuing way,
               Confesse the highest Powers gouerne all,
               But that with mortals heere they vse to play,
               As we at hazzard tosse a Tennis-ball:
               
               Some all would haue by Chance and Fortune fall;
               Some others grant that God doth all incline,
               But that mans wit, and will must worke withall,
               These men with God in gouernment, doe ioyne
               And his most constant purpose to mans will confine.
            
            
               
               Some, to excuse God, grant that Power diuine
               Permitteth euill, but not with his will,
               And suffreth Satan heere to blind the eyne
               Of Reprobates; but no wayes ill doth will,
               But sure God willingly permitteth ill,
               Since by his power he goodnesse able is,
               To draw from ill, his purpose to fulfill;
               For thus did Pharaoh wilfully amisse,
               Yet God turnes all to's glory, and his chosens blisse.
            
            
               As Sunnes pure beames exhale from filthy Oose
               
               
                  Foule vapours, which no whit the Sunne defile,
               So doth Gods Prouidence of ill dispose,
               Yet of no euill he partakes the while:
               And as not in Sunnes Beames, but in the soyle,
               The matter of th
                     •
                   vapour doth consist,
               So in mans heart is Bitternesse and bile,
               And not in God, who euill doth resist,
               Or turnes such euill into Goodnesse, as he list.
            
            
               Thus Kings, Priests, Rulers, Elders all combin'd
               Against the Lord, and his anointed Sonne:
               And Pilat
                        •
                     , Herod, Iewes and Gentiles ioynd,
               To doe what God decreed to be done:
               But they ment wickedly eu'n euery one,
               The people a vaine thing imagined,
               To crucifie the Lord of Life they runne,
               But God, we see, thereby hath quickened
               The members all, whereof he is the glorious head.
               
            
            
               As when we see faire Phoebus gentle beames,
               
               Vnited in a burning glasse, enflame,
               We vse not to accuse Sunnes gracious gleames,
               
               For such offence, but Burning-glasse doe blame,
               Wherin, without the Sunne, 's nor heat nor flame.
               So when we see the wicked man abuse
               The fairest gifts of Nature to his shame;
               The Author of them we must not accuse,
               But wilfull man, that doth them heere vnduly vse.
            
            
               
               Good, Powerfull, Wise, Disposer of all things!

               How should an ignorant, weake, wicked wight,
               Conceiue thy Wisedome, Power, and Prouidence?
               
               Much lesse by Simile it more inlight,
               It farre surpasseth mine intelligence:
               Things knowne I doe admire, the rest I reuerence.
            
            
               But I by Prouidence diuine am led
               To passe the bounds of f
                        •
                     ugall meditation:
               Pardon, great Clarkes, that I haue meddled
               To taste a mysterie, by Contemplation,
               Worthy your argument, and disputation:
               
               I was desirous to resolue my minde
               In this high point of heau'nly moderation,
               
               Wherein most wondrous comfort I doe find,
               To see how things on earth are first in heau'n design'd.
            
            
               Who can suppose this world so perfect, rare,
               Not gouern'd by one pow'rfull prouidence?
               
               Since all which without moderat
                     •
                  urs are,
               Consisting of the foure first elements,
               Can not continue; Houses, 
                        •
                     enements,
               
               Without a tenant, ruine and decay:
               Vnpruned Vines doe loose their excellence,
               Mans Body failes, when soule doth passe away;
               So would this Vniuerse, should God forbeare a day.
            
            
               As members of a man aright do moue
               First by his vnderstanding and his will,
               So doth this Vniuerse by God aboue,
               And all concord his pleasure to fulfill:
               Who duely wait on Prouidence, he will
               Make happy heere, and blessed euermore:
               Not that he doth the carelesse idle fill
               With blessings temporall, or heau'nly store.
               Who will not row on Sea, shall neuer come a-shore.
            
            
               
               It is a dangerous and impious thing,
               Thus to dispute with Prouidence diuine,
               Mine arme nor good, nor bad, to passe can bring,
               All's done by the Almighties firme designe:
               The written Word must be our square and line,
               Gods secret purpose, and reuealed Will
               
               Confound not by a vaine conceit of thine:
               Thus Theeues may, blamelesse, true men rob and kill,
               And say they but Gods secret purposes fulfill.
            
            
               For Prouidence doth not vs mortals tend,
               As mothers infants newly brought to light,
               Which haue no strength themselues then to defend
               'Gainst ayers iniuries, or forreine might:
               But as the Father that his Sonne hath dight
               With strength, and weapons 'gainst his enemies,
               Directeth him to order them aright,
               And to defend himselfe from iniuries,
            
            
               
                  Religion neuer negligent and idle lyes.
               They that are godly and religious,
               With Prouidence sweet Diligence do ioyne,
               God that without our selues hath fashion'd vs,
               Without thy selfe saues neither thee nor thine:
               And therefore prudent men prouide in time,
               Against all future want that happen may;
               When therefore we for morrow do designe
               Things necessary; none can iustly say,
               Or iudge vs too much carefull, for the following day.
            
            
               The Lord of all did needfull things prouide,
               Therefore the bagge false Iudas carried,
               The Loaues and Fishes which he did diuide
               Amongst fiue thousand which him followed,
               Th' Apostles carri'd for their dayly bread:
               
                  Paul temp'rall Almes prouideth for his Nation,
               Where he the spirituall had published:

               Of these learne to prouide things necessary:
               Of Beasts to shunne and to auoid all ill;
               Who neere things hurtfull to them do not tarry,
               Nor nigh vnto those places trauell will,
               Where they into a Ditch haue lately fill;
               The Bird escapt, eschewes the Fowlers gin,
               Nor will be tempted more with all his skill:
               The fish that finds the hooke the bait within,
               Thence to prouide against such danger doth begin.
            
            
               Things past, for future, are sound documents,
               He that is wise, the euill doth foresee,
               And hides himselfe from many nocuments,
               Which can not by the foole auoided be:
               Most admirable, vertuous, wise is he,
               That things foreseeing wisely can prouide,
               Nothing on earth without a cause we see,
               Though them the highest Wisdome so doth hide
               They can not by our feeble reason be descride.
            
            
               The World may be compared to a Stage,
               
               We mortals to spectators, they that stay
               Without to see her antique equipage;
               
               Doe truely as they ought behold the play:
               
               The curious that about the Stage do stray,
               And pry into the secret tyring roome,
               
               Are by Stage-keepers often driu'n away:
               All must not into Natures secrets come,
               Although she many Mysteries reueale to some.
            
            
               How dares proud man inquire so curiously
               Of Gods 
                     
                        •
                     id counsels, and his secret will?
               
               The Bethshemites into the Arke did pry,
               And God with sudden vengeance them doth kill.
               Prouide thee good things, and auoid the ill,
               So maist thou many liue, and happy dayes,
               Presume not to be wise aboue thy skill,

               His secret Counsels search not, but admire and praise.
            
            
               
               And yet because God all doth here dispose,
               Thou like a senslesse Idol must not stand:

               And labour, with all care and diligence,

            MEDITATION 3.
            Of Diligence.
            
               WHo, with a prudent heart, and godly minde,
               Wil take a view how things are wrought below,
               In all effects shall good and euill find,
               As cause is good or ill, from whence they flow;
               Thus God first Cause of all thy actions know,
               As they be good; thy selfe as they be ill;
               Which doth Gods pow'r and goodnesse greater show,
               In vsing heere mans vile corrupted will,
               
               As second cause his sound, good purpose to fulfill.
            
            
               All euill then comes from mans vicious will,
               
               Not moou'd thereto by meere necessity,
               
               As senselesse Agents are to good or ill,
               But giues consent thereto most willingly:
               By Natures Light we good from ill descry,
               But this vs onely leaues without excuse,
               When seeing better we the worst doe try,
               And thus God of mans malice makes good vse,
               And he is iustly punished for his abuse.
            
            
               Oh mans peruersenesse! grant him least freewill,
               
               And he becomes vaine, proud and insolent:

                  ny him any power to doe or will,
               
               And he growes lazy, slothfull, negligent:
               
               First kinde are meritorious, impudent,
               
               And merit for themselues and others will,
               The other Epicure-like, take content
               In pleasure, eating, drinking of their fill,

               But Diligence, the Grace I next propound,
               For this last euill is best remedy,
               This Viper which most dang'rously doth wound

               And brings too aspish-lazy Accidy:
               Most perilous, because we feele least harme.
               Oh, this is Satans subtillest Lullaby,
               
               Our soules with stupid lazinesse to charme,
               And then of spirituall armes and weapons to disarme▪

               To all which at thy comming thou dost-find
               Intent vnto their Masters businesse,
               And diligent in body and in minde,
               Make all my Soules and Bodies powr's inclind
               To Diligence, whilst I her praises write,
               Vnloose the chaines, the fetters strong vnbind
               Of Sloth and Dulnesse, which, to blackest night
               Leade blindfold, drowsie soules that take therein delight.
            
            
               
                  Vigilance, Industry, and Diligence
               
               So like indeed one to another are,
               My plainer Muse scarse sees a difference,
               And therefore all will but as one declare;
               Our soules and bodies powers they prepare,
               In eu'ry noble Vertue to transcend,
               Nothing on earth that's admirable rare,
               Without these can be brought to perfect end,
               On these do honest care and labour aye attend.
            
            
               For godly, iust and necessary cares
               
               Are parts substantiall of Diligence,
               
               And as she for the future thus prepares,
               Hauing to Truth and Iustice reference,
               She is a Grace of wondrous excellence:
               But if she spring from Enuy, emulation,
               
               
                  Ambition, Feare, or other base pretence,
               She is a curious base abomination,

               Yet oft we see their wondrous force doth tame,
               Things against Nature, without violence;

               Where Industry and Diligence conspire,
               Wants nothing that we can in mortall man desire.
            
            
               For as she many euill things amends,

               Oh! when our fatall hower-glasse is runne,
               And we are call'd to render our account,
               Of good and euill in the body done;

               This Diligence is like one in a Myne,
               That digges much earth a little gold to find;
               Like Silkeworme, who her slendrest silken twine,
               By Diligence doth on a bottome wind:

               Like little stones by Morter fast combin'd,

               The Golden-fleece, the Kingdomes Peace I call:
               The Dragon, him by whom all's ordered:
               For on whose shoulders such a charge doth fall,
               He must be vigilant, and diligent in all.

               Let heau'nly loue into mine heart distill,

               For Diligence on earth, I loue in heau'n shall gaine.

               To paire of Compasses I like the wise,

               The Cynicke, that he might his hate expresse

               Base Commodus, of all the Caesars knowne
               To be most wicked, was not of his owne
               Nature so vile: but when his youth by ease,
               Into contempt of Businesse was growne,
               This was the Empires fatall last disease,
               Which lost the Caesars all their fathers did increase.
            
            
               Oh cursed Negligence! that dost confound
               Soules, Bodies, Churches, Cities, Families;
               No gracious Thrift will grow vpon thy ground,
               Thy field like wildernesse all barren lies.
               It Soules, like deadly Opium, stupifies:
               It with diseases doth our Bodies fill,

            MEDITATION 4.
            Of Care and Labour.
            
               MY freer Muse now like a Faulcon flies,
               Who hauing stoup't a Mallard at the Brooke,
               Remounts againe vp to the azure skies,
               And for a second Souse at him doth looke:
               But suddenly she hath that prey forsooke,
               And towreth at a Heron in the Ayre:
               So though at first my Muse had vndertooke
               Faire Abs
                        •
                     inence; yet seeing Thrift doth pray her,
               To sing of Care and Labour next, I will obay her.
            
            
               
               This Booke indeed I wholly did intend
               Vnto the honour of Frug
                        •
                     lity,
               
               And morall vertues that her Grace attend:
               But so my Muse doth loue her libertie,
               And at the fairest is so vsde to flie;
               She will not leaue her heau'nly Meditation,
               
               For any Flower of Humanity:
               
               Her food diuine of holy Contemplation,
               For any earthly Good, Content, or Delectation.
            
            
               I grant indeed, that morall Meditation
               
               May much amend our manners, and our mind,
               But no such pleasing taste and sustentation,
               As in diuine, the soule of man can find:
               And therefore though I often am inclin'd,
               The Praise of morall Vertues here to sing,
               My freer Muse that will not be confin'd,
               Runs straight on 
                     〈…〉
                   string,
               Else I, in others 
                     〈…〉
                   not meddeling.
            
            
               And yet I hope no wiser Clerkes will blame
               My boldnesse, here to taste, by meditation,
               The Mysteries, whose knowledge they proclaime
               To vs, as necessary for Saluation:
               Thereby to square our Liues and Conuersation.
               And though indeed my Writings I intend,
               For others minds and manners reformation,
               Yet if hereby I may mine owne amend,
               I haue attained more then halfe my wished end.
            
            
               It is no part of holy Contemplation,
               To seeke reuenge for vndeserued wrong;
               
                  Meeknesse and Patiences meditation
               Haue taught my Muse to sing another song:
               God send me more Wit, them a better Tong.
               Now Thou, that Adam in his vprightnesse,
               (To shew, that Labour doth to man belong)
               Didst place in Eden, it to plant and dresse,
               Helpe me, the praise of Care and Labour to expresse.
            
            
               
               
                  Care's an attent intention of the mind,
               To any thing that's needfull to be done,
               Which good and honest for our selues we find,
               And may vnto the publike profit come:
               
                  Labour puts Care in execution,
               And is our minds and bodies Enargy,
               In any businesse by Care begun:
               For when to Businesse we do apply
               Our selues, we call that Labour, Paines, and Industry.
               
            
            
               
                  Care comes from Wits chiefe Vigor, Strength, and Light,
               And ready, watchfull euermore doth stand:
               
                  Labour, the Bodies Faculty is hight,
               Which doth performe the thing we haue in hand:
               Where these two powr's of action do band,
               We Actors and Directors call them may;
               One doth what worke the other doth command:
               For as the Body doth the Soule obay,
               So Labour is to noble Care obedient ay.

               Nor good, nor ill are, but indifferent,
               And not amongst those Vertues numbered,
               Which in the Court of Loue are eminent:
               But for they nothing, that is excellent,
               Can without Care and Labours helpe attaine,
               All in their Company take great content,
               And honour much amongst Loues royall traine:
               And glad is she, that can their best acquaintance gaine.
            
            
               
                  Care's like an old experienc't Generall,
               Too weake to fight, yet orders all the Hoste:
               
                  Labour is lusty, valiant, young, and tall,
               And strikes, where foes he may indanger most:
               
                  Care hath an eye about to euery Coast,
               With all aduantages to win the day:
               And though more sweat and blood it Labour cost,
               Yet which deserueth best, 'tis hard to say;
               Neither had wonne the field, had one but beene away.
            
            
               
               When Iupiter an Hercules would frame,
               Three nights at once he with Al
                        •
                     mena lay:
               Thus to beget one that should Monsters tame,
               Men lost, to lengthen out the night, a day:
               Besides, the pangs of Birth her so dismay,
               It little fail'd, but she had borne her last.
               By witty Fictions, Poets thus bewray,
               How it Ioues ordinary strength surpast,

               And thus they make Ioue, Hercules his Sire,
               Who must on earth all Labours vndertake;
               And clense worlds Stables from impurest mire,
               And Ioue of him a mighty god should make.
               To tell what for immortall Honors sake
               He did, were too long for a Meditation:
               He made the yron-gates of Hell to quake,
               And Atlas-like, bare vp the worlds foundation,
               What can be more for Care and Labours commendation?
            
            
               He was not fostred in his younger yeeres,
               With Pleasures, wanton Ease, and Idlenesse,
               But fought with Lyons, Tygres, Goats, and Beares,
               Lust, Rapine, Tyranny, Vnrighteousnesse.
               No high thing is attain'd by Slouthfulnesse.
               Then spake great Alexander like a King,
               By calling seruile Slouth and Lazinesse,
               But Care and Labour highly honouring,
               Which in small time to him worlds Monarchy did bring.

                  Labour increaseth strength, and who her knowes,
               Doth passe through hardest iourneys without toile.

               Those that are fall'n: things hardest reconcile,
               She Vertue by employment furthers more.

               And Pleasure followes: for obserue these two,
               
                  Delight and Labour though much differing
               In nature, yet they link't together go;
               
                  Delight, I say, still Labour following:
               For things we labour most to passe to bring,
               We ioy in more, then those which vs befall
               By Chance, and without Paines and labouring.

               No solace without Labour: no man gaines
               The Hony, without danger of the Sting:
               He that will haue the Kernell, must take paines
               To breake the shell: who, sweetest Rose in Spring
               Will gather, feares not Bushes prickeling:
               But he that in his bosome hides his hand,
               Whom honor, profit, feare, nor shame can bring
               To action, but doth all day idle stand,
               He hates all Vertue, and is hated by their Band.
            
            
               The Roots of Arts are bitter, but they beare
               The sweetest fruits: we can no Good obtaine
               But by hard Labour. Thus if we prepare
               Vs quiet Peace, what happinesse we gaine?
               The Minds and Bodies rest, them fits againe
               For Cares and Labours new: as Bow vnbent,
               Or Lute-string loosed to a lower straine,
               That it may be vp to a higher pent,
               And that the Bow may shoot the stronger newly bent.
            
            
               God here hath placed on our either hand,
               Commodities and Discommodities:
               These neere, those far, Labor 'twixt both doth stand:
               To these a way prone and precipite lies,
               Who comes to those, great difficulties tries,
               Which they by Labour onely ouercome.
               Labour which wise mens wishes here supplies,
               And doth to them the trustiest Guide become,
               Eu'n from their infancie, vnto their resting Tombe.
            
            
               
               Worse than the vilest Infidell is he,
               That will not care nor labour for his owne:
               How many goods and benefits there be,
               To men on earth by Care and Labour knowne;
               So many ills by Carelesnesse are sowne:

               She brings good-husbands store of grasse and corne,
               And plentifully feeds the hungry poore:
               She makes the Shepherds lambes grow great and more,
               She is the stay of Trades and Merchandize;

            Of Death.

                  Of Graces, at thy comming thee to greete,
               For thou wilt not for fauour, gold or gaine,
               Thy fatall stroke, one moment, heere refraine:
               Well, close mine eyes, and dimme my Bodies Light,
               
               These shining Gems for euer shall remaine,
               My soule for to enlighten; Oh! then smite,
               It skils not when, nor how, so as my heart stands right.
               
            
            
               Ah! why look'st thou so pale, as thou didst feare?
               Thee, before men and Angels, I forgiue,
               I wish thee not a minute to forbeare,
               I neuer shall the Life of Glory liue,
               Till thou vnlock'st the doore my soule to giue
               Inlargement from this Prison-house of clay,
               For which she long hath struggled and did striue,

               Welcome, as sleepe, to them that right thee know,
               And easie as a Downy-Bed of Rest,
               But thou most gastly-terrible dost show,
               To those, that thou do'st vnawares arrest:
               Sweet hau'n to Soules with worlds winds, waues opprest;
               A Rocke to those that swimme in sweet Delight;
               Sweet hoast of Saints, who with perfumes hath drest
               The Beds, wherein their Bodies, all the night,
               May rest, till Trumpets sound, awake to glorious Light.

               To Soules, that in the flesh imprison'd be;
               One must dye euer; th'other shall be free.

               That I may Death discerne, ere Death we ouertake.
            
            
               What's Death but a diuorce or separation,
               
               Of Man and Wife, that neuer could agree,
               From Bed and Boo

               The guilty Flesh payes Costs, the Soule is free;
               
               Yet Both ere long shall one another see,
               Freed from foule Sinne, the cause of all their strife,
               And shall in Wedlocks Bands reioined be,
               To loue, and liue, for aye, like Man and Wife,
               
               A holy, happy, quiet, and eternall Life.
               
            
            
               
               But this I of the first Death vnderstand;
               (Lord! of the second, neuer let me taste)
               
                  This is the way into the holy Land,
               
               
                  That doth into continuall darknesse cast:
               No mortall Sense did euer see or tast
               The seconds anguish, terrour, horrour, paine:
               The first is short, the second aye doth last,
               Age, Sicknesse, men to dye the first constraine,
               The Diuels in the second, soules and bodies chaine.
            
            
               
                  This, setteth willing soules from bodies free,
               
                  That, soules in bodies holds against their will,
               By this, from Bodies weight we quited be,
               
                  That, with such weight of sinne the soule doth fill,
               As to the Pit infernall presse it will:
               
                  This, takes good men away before their time,
               Lest they be ouer-whelm'd with too much ill,
               
                  That, seizeth on the wicked, for their crime.
               
                  That leadeth downe to Hell, by this to heau'n we clime▪
               
            
            
               The first, hath onely power in the graue,
               
               
                  Second, in Hell; One, vs depriues of sense,
               By th' other, sense of endlesse Paine we haue,
               
                  Both, haue one name, yet see their difference.
               
                  Sinne mother is of both: In innocence
               
               Had Adam stood, Death neuer had been knowne,
               But second Adam hath remou'd long sence
               The sting of this first Death, eu'n by his owne:
               
               Thus from a Plague, Death is to Saints a fauour growne.
            
            
               Christ meeteth her as Esau on the way,
               And giues a charge vnto her rougher hands,
               No euill against Iacob to assay;
               Thus turnes he to embracements all her Bands;
               
               
                  Death, made by Sinne our mortall foe, now stands
               Our first fast friend, to bring vs vnto blesse;
               And though awhile our carkases she brands

               All first Death gets, is Rottennesse and Dust,
               
               A Body onely, in corruption sowne,
               To kill seeds of Concupiscence and Lust,
               
               That it more glorious after may be knowne,
               Our earthly part thus turneth to her owne,
               But shall againe a heau'nly body rise,
               And as at first, be with the Spirit one,
               Which long hath liu'd in ioyous Paradise,
               
               Waiting till Christ her mortall should immortalize.
               
            
            
               Alas! why should wee then be so afraid,
               Heere to endure a little griefe or paine,
               Be it on Racke, or Bed? so I be laid
               Safe in my Graue, my soule thereby shall gaine;
               Lord! grant me Faith, and Patience to maintaine
               
                  Hels last encounter, when my Soule is shaken!
               The holy Martyrs did not so complaine
               Of Paine, when Soule was from the body taken,
               As when their Conscience by tentation was awaken.
            
            
               
                  This Death, though painefull, quicke dispatch doth make,
               The second, hath eternitie and paine,
               They rightly at Death's horrour, quake and shake,
               Where griefes within, more than without remaine,
               Whose conscienc

               Than any outward torment they endure,
               Who sees heau'ns most incomparable gaine,
               And can thereof by Faith himselfe secure,
               Is certaine, Death can nought but good to him procure.
            
            
               For body fraile, one like his glorious head
               
               For pleasures, profits, hopes and honours vaine,
               (Whereby than eas'd, we are more troubled:)
               Eternall rest, and freedome from all paine,
               Wer't thou, my Soule, but sentenc'd to remaine
               In this fraile body, yet a thousand yeeres,
               Oh! how wouldst thou of wearinesse complaine,
               And maladies thy Flesh about her beares,
               And seeke Death as a blessing eu'n with many teares?
            
            
               
               Yea should this life last without tediousnesse,
               Oh! Doe but thinke that as thou more do'st sinne,
               Thou addest more vnto thy wretchednesse,
               For Death at first, by Sinne did enter in,
               Who would not leaue these loathsome ragges! to winne
               That glorious, shining roabe of Righteousnesse,
               Thou shalt not lose thy Body, but thy Sinne,
               
               Thou it againe shalt meete in happinesse,
               
                  Corruption shall indeede be changed, not thy Flesh.
               
            
            
               As Golden Ore, in Finers fier cast,
               Is not consum'd, but cleans'd from drosse, and tride;
               
               So substance of the body doth not waste,
               
               Onely by Death is purg'd, and purifide.
               Should Soules heere in their Tabernacles 'bide,
               With all infirmities till Day of Doome,
               
               How weary would they be, of rest denide,
               And wish their Bodies sleeping in their Tombe,
               Vntill the ioyfull Day of Resurrection come?
            
            
               So long as heere our Bodies doe remaine,
               They haue like Wooll one ti

                     cture naturall,
               
               But Death them dyeth all in purple graine,
               
               To make them Robes for Sprites Celestiall,
               
               For we in heau'n like Kings and Princes all
               
               Shall reigne in new Hierusalem for ay,
               The Graue vs like each side of Red Sea wall,
               
               From cruell Egypts bondage on our way,
               Doth to the Land of heauenly Canaan conuay.
            
            
               As he, who for ill-doing lyeth bound,
               Trembles &amp; quakes when loosed from his bands,
               He must before the Iudgement Seal be found,
               To giue account for workes done by his hands,
               But he most stout and resolutely stands,
               Whose Conscience him of euill doth acquite:
               So men reioyce, or feare, when Death commands
               Them to appeare before the Iudge vpright,
               
               There to receiue iust doome, for things done wrong or right.
               
            
            
               
               As water-drops, which fall in Fountaine pure,
               Die not, but are preseru'd incontinent,
               So Bodies perish not, but ay indure,
               Onely resolu'd to their first Element:
               
               Our spirits fly to heau'n whence they were lent.
               As drops of raine which from the heau'ns descend,
               Are all into the wombe of Tethys sent:
               So Saints dead Bodies to Earths bowels tend,
               Whence drawn vp by Sonnes heate, to heau'n they re-ascend.
            
            
               What is our Life? a wind, a course to death:
               They that on Earth the longest course can gaine,
               
                  Runne in the end themselues quite out of breath,
               And no more but their courses end obtaine;
               To which, they that liue fewer yeeres attaine.
               God here to men doth life, like money, lend:
               Which at our Day we must pay backe againe.
               As without oyle the Lampe no light doth send,
               So when our humid's spent, our Life is at an end.
            
            
               As Pilgrim with long trauell wearied,
               Layes downe his Flesh to sleepe in darkest night,
               But Visions houering about his head,
               Do shew vnto his Soule most heau'nly Light,
               And doth with Dreames his spirits so delight,
               He wisheth oft the night would euer last:
               So fares it with the new-deceased wight,
               When in the graue his Body sleepeth fast,
               And Angels haue his Soule in Abra
                        •
                     ams-bosome plac't.
            
            
               As Starres of heau'n, which first in East do shine,
               Arise, till their Meridian they haue past,
               But do from thence as fast againe decline,
               Till they into the Westerne Seas are cast:
               Eu'n so vaine Mortals, here are all in hast,
               Till they their highest pitch of strength attaine;
               But that once got, they fall againe as fast,
               And downeward to the graue descend amaine,
               Some here a shorter, some a longer course obtaine.
            
            
               
               And as hee's happiest, whom the swiftest wind
               Brings soonest to the Port, and hau'n of rest,
               So's he, that soonest in the graue doth find
               Harbour against worlds stormes, which him infest.
               
                  Death doth but like his brother Sleepe arrest
               The weary wight, where he a longer night,
               Himselfe in graue, than in his bed may rest;
               And yet no longer, than till Christ our Light
               Awakes vs, to enioy for ay his glorious sight.
            
            
               To all that labour, pleasing is the end;
               The Traueller inquireth for his Inne:
               The hired Seruant, when his Yeere doth end:
               The Husband, when his Haruest doth beginne:
               Merchant of his Aduentures comming in:
               The Woman, when her ninth Month doth expire:
               So Saints, of Death haue euer mindfull bin:
               For where's our Treasure, there's our hearts desire,
               And where our Crowne is laid, our eyes do ay aspire.
            
            
               Therefore the dying Saints like Swans do sing,
               Foreseeing, that they in the graue should rest
               From Labours, and be freed from the sting
               Of Sinne, which here their liues did most infest:
               Why should we with Deaths feare be so distrest?
               When as the Lord of Life himselfe did die,
               That we from sting of Death might be releast;
               Eu'n Sinne, the Cause of all our Misery,
               And made Death our first step to true Felicity.
            
            
               The truth hereof the sacred Pages seale,
               When that which commonly we dying call,
               They call it sleeping: For Christ did repeale
               The Act of dying, by his Funerall:
               Thus Patriarchs, Prophets, Kings, Apostles,

               The Wiseman therefore, better doth commend
               The Day of Death, then of Natiuity;
               
               By that, our paine and labours haue an end;
               This, the Beginning is of Misery:
               The Lord of Life, who Life and Death did try,
               Proclaimeth endlesse Blessednesse to those,
               With rest from labour, in the Lord that die:
               Blessed whom he to liue in him hath chose,
               But till their Death, from Labour they haue no repose.
               
            
            
               See, but how wiser Heathens entertaine

               How they on Birth-dayes, lowd lament and plaine;
               At Funerals, make mirth and melody;
               For that begins, this ends all misery:
               No man, say they, that doth not Death despise,
               Can here on earth enioy true Liberty,
               
               They onely saw an end of miseries,
               But lo! heau'n stands wide open vnto Christians eyes.
            
            
               Ah why should Painters limme Death with a dart,
               
               Time with a Syth, before him cuts all downe,
               
                  Death doth but lance, and play the Surgeons part,
               Time fells the Corne, that's ready to be mowne.
               Alas! what Cruelty hath Death vs showne?
               Thou art but as a Seruant vnto time▪
               
               To gather Fruits which, he saith, ripe be growne:
               In Wine-presse thou but treade

                     s that there it may refine.
            
            
               As we greene Fruites more difficultly pull,
               Than those we find hang ripe vpon the tree,
               So youthfull Sprites of heate and vigor full,
               More hardly die than they that aged be:
               This is the greatest difference we see,
               Betweene their courses that are short and long,
               
               
                  Both goe the broad way of Mortality,
               
               Death, like a mighty wind here layes along,

               Looke all the generations gone and past,

               As 'twas a type of endlesse happinesse,
               
               But since Christ in his youth of Death did taste.
               All Substances fulfill'd, their Figures cease,
               Now happiest he whom Death the soonest doth release.
            
            
               Happy, though clouds of stones thy head infold
               Like Steph'ns, so open heau'ns shew pure &amp; cleare,
               And though a Trance like Pauls so fast thee hold,
               That whether thou without the Body were,
               Or in the Body, thou canst not declare.
               Though thus Death doth like sleepe they flesh arrest,
               The ioyes of heau'n shall to thy Soule appeare,
               Not to be vttered: Lo, they are best
               By Negatiues, not by Affirmatiues exprest.
            
            
               No eye hath seene, no eare hath euer heard,
               No heart conceiue, no tongue that can recite
               The ioyes, th' Almighty hath in heau'n prepar'd,
               For them that here do liue and die aright:
               Oh enter Soule into thy Lords delight!
               This ioy thou canst not in thy selfe containe,
               For thou art bounded, that is infinite;
               Who enters, shall for euer there remaine,
               And for these finite Cares, Ioy infinite obtaine.
            
            
               Oh! who can know this Death, and be afraid?
               Although amongst the pots thou lie a time,
               Thou like a siluer Doue, shalt be arraid
               With golden feathers, which like heau'n shall shine.
               But ah! Thus with my selfe I do diuine,
               Without least perill, by free Speculation:
               But should Death seize on this my brittle Shrine,
               
               And offer me to act my Meditation,
               
               How should I tremble at my houses desolation!
            
            
               
               That which is now familiar to my thought,
               Will bring me then Amazement, Horror, Feare.
               Alas! this battel's not so easily fought,
               Except Iehouah on our side appeare.
               Didst thinke, Death would with Complement forbeare,
               And onely thee delight with Meditation?
               No, he will try what courage thou dost beare,
               And seize vpon thy Fleshes habitation,
               
               It laying waste, till all in Christ haue restauration.
               
            
            
               Then as I feele this outward man decay,
               Grant I may strong and stronger grow within,
               And by a constant daily dying may
               Be arm'd, against this strong man enter in;
               That though he seize vpon this man of sinne,
               
               My inward man may like the siluer Doue,
               That newly hath escap't the Fowlers ginne,
               Fly to her Lord and Sauiour aboue,
               And be embraced in his blessed armes of Loue.
               
            
            
               Oh! there I shall inioy eternall rest,
               And happy Peace, which here I craue and misse,
               And wander further more and more distrest.
               What if some little paine in passage is,
               Which makes fraile flesh to feare Deaths pallid kisse?
               That paine's well borne, that endlesse ease doth gaine,
               And from Sinnes cruell slauery dismisse.
               
                  Sleepe after Toyle, faire-weather after raine,
               
               
                  Peace after Warre; ease is most pleasing after paine.
               
            
            
               We all are wanderers weary of our way,
               
               And hasting to the Graue our certaine home:
               
               This world's the Flood which doth our passage stay,
               TillDeath

               Who Life did limit by eternall Doome,

               Yet if thou Souldier-like art entred in,

               And that accurst hand-writing to deface,
               No sinnes can be so great, but Mercy may haue place.
            
            
               
               How then should any wretched wight be wonne,
               To spoile the Castle of his life and state?
               
               Is't not Gods doing whatsoeuer's done
               In heau'n and earth? Did he not all create
               To liue and die by his eternall Fate?

               That constant holds the world in changing state,
               All ought be willing here to liue or die:
               Life, Death, ordained are by heau'nly Destiny.

               I leaue this Tent of brittle clay, to gaine
