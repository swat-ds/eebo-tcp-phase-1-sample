            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            THE EPISTLE TO ALL Readers, that Epigrams must bee read attentiuely, that Legere &amp; non intellegere, est negligere.
            WHen in your hand you had this Pamphlet caught,
            Your purpose was to post it ouer speedie,
            But change your minde, and feede not ouer-greedy:
            Till in what sort, to feede you first be taught.
            Suppose both first and second course be done,
            No Goose, Porke, Capon, Snites, nor such as these,
            But looke for fruit, as Nuts, and Parma-cheese,
            And Comfets, Conserues, Raisons of the Sunne.
            Then taste but few at once, feede not too fickle,
            So shall you finde some coole, some warme, some biting,
            Some sweet in taste, some sharpe, all so delighting,
            As may your inward taste, and fancie tickle.
            But though I wish Readers, with stomacks full,
            Yet fast nor come not, if your wits be dull.
            For I had liefe you did sit downe and whistle,
            As reading, not to reede. So ends th' Epistle.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, GEORGE MARques Buckingham, Viscount Villeirs, Baron of Whaddon, Iustice in Eyre of all his Maiesties Forrests, Parks, and Chases beyond Trent, Master of the Horse to his Maiestie, and one of the Gentlemen of his Maiesties Bedchamber, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Councell of England and Scotland.
            
               Most Honoured Lord,
            
            
               THis posthume book is furnished vvith worth, but it wanteth a Patron. A worthier thē your 
                  •
               elfe the Booke could not find, nor your Lordship a more patheticall Poet to Patronize. If in Poetry, Heraldry

were admitted, he would be found in happinesse of wit neere allied to the great Sydney: yet but neere; for the Apix of the Coelum Empyrium is not more inaccessable then is the height of Sydneys Poesy, which by imagination we may approch, by imitation neuer attaine to. To great men our very syllables should be short, and therfore I make my Conclusion a Petition; That your Lordshippes acceptation may shew how much you fauor the noble Name, and nature of the Poet, and Booke. VVhich deigned by your Lordshippe, I shall thinke my paines in collecting, and disposing of these Epigrams well placed, and euer rest.
            
               Your Lordships most bounden seruant, I. B.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            Sir IOHN HARRINGTONS Epigrams, the first Booke.
            
               Against MOMVS. 1 That his Poetrie shall be no fictions, but meere truths.
               SCant wrate I sixteene lines, but I had newes,
               
                  Momus had found one fault, past all excuse,
               That of Epistle I the name abuse.
               No, gentle Momus, that is none abuse,
               Without I call that Gospel that ensues.
               But read to carpe, as still hath been thine vse:
               Fret out thine heart to search, seeke, sift and pry,
               Thy heart shall hardly giue my pen the ly.
            
            
               
                  2 Against Sextus, a scorner of Writers.
               OF Writers, Sextus known a true despiser,
               Affirmes, that on our writings oft he lookes,
               And confesseth he growes ne're the wiser.
               But Sextus, where's the fault? not in our bookes.
               No sure, tis in your selfe (Ile tell you wherefore)
               
                  Bookes giue not wisedome where was none before.
               But where some is, there reading makes it more.
            
            
               
                  3 Against Lesbia, both for her patience and impatience.
               
                  LEsbia, I heard, how ere it came to passe,
               That when old P
                        •
                     leus call'd thy Lord an Asse,
               You did but smile; but when he cald him Oxe,
               Straight-waies you curst him with all plagues &amp; pox.
               There is some secret cause why you allow
               A man to scorne his braine, but not his brow.
            
            
               
                  4 Of a poynted Diamond giuen by the Author to his wife, at the birth of his eldest sonne.
               DEare, I to thee this Diamond commend,
               In which, a modell of thy selfe I send,
               How lust vnto thy ioynts this circlet sitteth,
               So iust thy face and shape my fancies fitteth.
               The touch will try this Ring of purest gold,
               My touch tries thee as pure, though softer mold.
               That metall precious is, the stone is true
               As true, as then how much more precious you?
               The Gem is cleare, and hath nor needes no foyle,
               Thy face, nay more, thy fame is free from soile.
               
                  
                  
                     •
                  oule deem this deare, because from me you haue it,
               
                  
                     •
                   deem your faith more deer, because you gaue it.
               This pointed Diamond cuts glasse and steele,
               Your loues like force in my firme heart I feele.
               But this, as all things else, time wasts with wearing,
               Where you, my Iewels multiply with bearing.
            
            
               
                  5 Against Writers that carpe at other mens bookes.
               THe Readers, and the Hearers like my bookes,
               But yet some Writers cannot them digest.
               But what care I? For when I make a feast,
               I would my Guests should praise it, not the Cookes.
            
            
               
                  6 Of a young Gallant.
               YOu boast, that Noble men still take you vp,
               That whē they bowle or shoot, or hawke or hunt,
               In Coach, or Barge, on horse thou still art wont,
               To runne, ride, row with them, to dine or s
                     •
                  p:
               This makes you scorne those of the meaner sort,
               And thinke your credit doth so farre surmount;
               Whereas indeed, of you they make no count,
               But as they doe of hawkes and dogges, for sport.
               Then vaunt not thus of this your vaine renowne,
               Lest we both take you vp, and take you downe.
            
            
               
               
                  7 To my Lady Rogers, the Authors wiues mother, how Doctor Sherehood comm
                     •
                  nded her house in Bathe▪
               
               I Newly had your little house erected,
               In which I thought I had made good conueiance,
               To vse each ease, and to shunne all annoyance,
               And prayd a friend of iudgement not neglected,
               To view the roomes, and let me know the faults.
               He hauing view'd the lodgings, staires, and vaults,
               Said all was excellent well, saue here and there.
               You thinke he praysd your house. No, I doe sweare,
               He hath disgrac'd it cleane, the case is cleere,
               For euery roome is either there, or here.
            
            
               
                  8 Of Lesbia, a great Lady.
               
                  LEsbia doth laugh to heare sellers and buyers
               Cald by this name, Substantiall occupyers:
               
                  Lesbia, the word was good while good folke vsd it,
               You mard it that with Chawcers iest abusd it:
               But good or bad, how ere the word be made,
               
                  Lesbia is loth perhaps to leaue the trade.
            
            
               
                  9 Of one that begd nothing, and had his sute granted.
               WHen thou dost beg, as none begs more importunate,
               And art deny'd, as none speeds more infortunate,
               
                  With one quaint phrase thou doost inforce thy begging,
               
                  
                     •
                  y mind vnto thy suite in this sort egging.
               
                  
                     •
                  las, sir this? Tis nothing, once deny me not.
               
                  
                     •
                  ell then, for once content, henceforth bely me not.
               Your words so wisely plaste, doe so inchaunt me,
               Sith you doe nothing aske, I nothing graunt yee.
            
            
               
                  10 Another of asking nothing.
               SOme thinke thee Lynus of a Fryer begotten,
               For still you beg where nothing can be gotten;
               Yet oft you say, for so you haue been taught,
               
                  
                     •
                  ir, grant me this, tis but a thing of nought.
               And when indeed you say so, I belieue it,
               As nought, vnto a thing of nought I giue it.
               Thus with your begging, you but get a mock,
               And yet with begging little, mend your stock.
               Leaue begging Lynus for such poore rewards,
               Else some will begge thee in the Court of Wards.
            
            
               
                  11 Of liberality in giuing nothing.
               I Heare some say, and some belieue it too,
               That craft is found eu'n in the clouted shoo▪
               
               Sure I haue found it with the losse of pence,
               My Tenants haue both craft and eloquence.
               For when one hath a suite before he aske it.
               His Orator pleades for him in a basket.
               Well Tenant well, he was your friend that taught you▪
               
               This learn'd Exordium, Master, here cha brought you.

                  Reynolds at Oxford, afore my Lord of Essex, and diuers Ladies and Courtiers, at the Queenes last beeing there, on these words: 
                     I do him nihil est, An Idol is nothing.
                  
               
               WHile I at Oxford stay'd, some few months since,
               To see, and serue our deare &amp; Soueraigne Prince▪
               
               Where graciously her Grace did see and show
               The choisest fruits that learning could bestow,
               I went one day to heare a learned Lecture
               Read (as some said) by Bellarmines correcter,
               And sundry Courtiers more then present were,
               That vnderstood it well saue here and there:
               Among the rest, one whom it least concerned,
               Askt me what I had at the Lecture learned?
               I that his ignorance might soone be guile▪
               
               Did say, I learned nothing all the while.
               Yet did the Reader teach with much facilitie,
               And I was wont to learne with some docilitie.
               What learn'd you, Sir, (quoth he) in swearing moode?
               I nothing learn'd, for nought I vnderstood,
               I thanke my Parents, they, when I was yong,
               Barr'd me to learne this Popish Romane tong,
               
                  And yet it seemes to me, if you say true,
               
                  
                     •
                   without learning learn'd the same that you,
               Most true, said I, yet few dare call vs Fooles,
               That this day learned nothing at the Schooles.
            
            
               
                  13 A Paradox of Doomes day.
               SOme Doctors deeme the day of Doome drawes neere:
               But I can proue the contrary most cleere,
               For at that day our Lord and Sauiour saith,
               That he on earth shall scant finde any faith,
               But in these daies it cannot be denyde,
               All boast of onely faith and nought beside:
               But if you seeke the fruit thereof by workes,
               You shall finde many better with the Turkes.

               For what he writes, I take no care nor heeding.
               For none of worth wil think them worth the reeding.

               Man, said the Priest, from coyne I cannot part,
               But I pray God blesse thee, with all my heart.
               O, said the man, the poore may liue with losse,
               Now Priests haue learn'd to Blesse without a crosse.

               When Iudges, who should heare both with equalitie
               By one side brib'd, to that shew partialitie.
               But Cosmus in this case doth well prouide,
               For euer he takes Bribes, of euery side:
               Wherefore on him complaine can no man rightly,
               But that he still may sentence giue vprightly.
               I first would chuse one that all Bribes doth loath,
               I next could vse him that takes bribes of both.

               His meate for that day, on the e'ue was drest.
               And lest the custome, that hee had to steale,
               Might cause him sometime to forget his zeale,

               ONe Lord, 2. Knights, 3. Squires, 7. Dames at least,
               My kind friend Marcus bade vnto his Feast,
               Where were both Fish and Flesh, and all acates,
               That men are wont to haue that feast great States.
               To pay for which, next day he sold a Nagge,
               Of whose pace, colour, Raine, he vs'd to bragge.
               Well, Ile ne're care for red, or fallow Deere,

                  38 Of an accident of saying grace at the Lady Rogers, who vsed to dine exceeding late. Written to his wife.
               MY Mall, in your short absence from this place,
               My selfe here dining at your mothers bord,
               Your little sonne did thus begin his grace;
               The eyes of all things looke on thee, ô Lord,
               And thou their foode doost giue them in due season.
               Peace boy, quoth I, not more of this a word,
               For in this place, this Grace hath little reason:
               When as we speake to God, we must speake true.
               And though the meat be good in taste and season,
               This season for a dinner is not due:
               Then peace, I say, to lie to God is treason.
               Say on, my boy, saith shee, your father mocks,
               Clownes, and not Courtiers, vse to goe by clocks.
               Courtiers by clocks, said I, and Clownes by cocks.
               Now, if your mother chide with me for this,
               Then you must reconcile vs with a kisse.

               SIr, I shall tell you newes, except you know it,
               Our noble friend Don Pedro, is a Poet.
               
                  His verses all abroad are read and showne,
               And he himselfe doth sweare they are his owne.
               His owne? tis true, for he for them hath paid
               Two crownes a Sonnet, as I heard it said.
               So Ellen hath faire teeth, that in her purse
               She keepes all night, and yet sleepes ne're the worse.
               So widdow Lesbia, with her painted hide,
               Seem'd, for the time, to make a handsome bride.
               If Pedro be for this a Poet cald,
               So you may call one hairie that is bald.

               Who call you beggers, you may call them lyers,
               Verses are growne such merchantable ware,
               That now for Sonnets, sellers are, and buyers.

               Seekes all he may to taint my reputation:
               Not with complaints, nor any haynous crimes,
               But onely saying in his scoffing fashion,
               These writers that still sauour of the schooles,
               Frame to themselues a Paradice of fooles.
               But while he scornes our mirth and plaine simplicitie,
               Himselfe doth sayle to Affricke and Ind.
               
               And seekes with hellish paines, yet doth not finde
               That blisse, in which he frames his wise felicitie.
               Now which of twaine is best, some wise men tell,
               Our Paradice, or else wise Paulus hell.

                  62 Of two Welsh Gentlemen.
               I Heard among some other pretty Tales,
               How once there were two Gentlemen of Wales,
               Of Noble bloud, discended of his House,
               That from our Ladies gowne did take a Louse.
               These two (thus goes the tale) vpon a day,
               Did hap to trauell vpon London way:
               
                  
                     •
                  nd for 'twas cumbersome to weare a boote,
               
                  
                     •
                  or their more ease, they needs would walke afoote.
               Their fare was dainty, and of no small cost,
               
                  
                     •
                  or euery meale they call'd for bak't and rost.

                  nd lest they should their best apparell lacke,
               Each of them bore his Wardrobe at his backe.
               Their Arrant was, but sore against their wils,

                  o maruell men of such a sumptuous Dyet,
               Were brought into the Star-chamber for a Ryot.
               These Squires one night arriued at a towne,
               To looke their lodgings, when the Sun was downe.
               And for the Inne-keeper his gates had locked,
               
                  
                     •
                  n haste, like men of some account they knocked.
               The drowsie Chamberlaine doth aske who's there.
               They told that Gentlemen of Wales they were.
               
                  How many, quoth the man, is there of you?
               Quoth they, Here is Iohn ap Rice, ap Iones, ap Hue;
               And Nicholas ap Steuen, ap Giles, ap Dauy.

                  63 To Master Maior of Bathe, that Bathe is like Paradice.
               SIr, if you either angry were or sory,
               That I haue lik'ned Bathe to Purgatory:
               Loe, to re-gaine your fauour in a trice,
               I'le proue it much more like to Paradice.
               Man was at first in Paradice created,
               Many men still in Bathe are procreated.
               Man liu'd there in state of Innocence,
               Here many liue in wit, like Innocents.
               There sprang the heads of foure most noble streames
               From hence flow springs, not matcht in any Realme

               Man, there was monylesse, naked and poore.
               Many goe begging here from dore to dore.
               Man there did taste the Tree he was forbidden.
               Here many men taste fruits, makes them be chidden
               Angels dwell there in pure and shining habit.
               Angels like faces, some this place inhabit.
               Angels let in all are admitted thither,

                  Many are said to goe to heauen from thence,
               Many are sent to heauen, or hell, from hence.

               Was so consum'd at last, as he did lacke
               Meate for his mouth, and clothing for his backe.

               May giue him all he hath, yet keepe his vow.

                  And sith that still the Curat was confuted,
               One said 'twas fit that they two changed functions.
               Nay, said the Iudge, that motion much I lothe,
               But if you will, wee'le make them Coblers both.

               WHen Lynus thinkes that he and I are friends,
               Then all his Poems vnto me he sends:
               His Disticks, Satyrs, Sonnets, and Exameters,
               His Epigrams, his Lyricks, his Pentameters.
               Then I must censure them, I must correct them,
               Then onely I must order, and direct them.
               I read some three or foure, and passe the rest,
               And when for answere, I by him am prest,
               I say, that all of them, some praise deserue,
               For certaine vses I could make them serue.
               But yet his rime is harsh, vneu'n his number,
               The manner much, the matter both doth cumber.
               His words too strange, his meanings are too mistic

               But at one word, I best indure his Disticke:
               And yet, might I perswade him in mine humor,
               Not to affect vaine praise of common rumor,
               Then should he write of nothing: for indeede,
               Gladly of nothing I his verse would reade.
            
            
               
               
                  68 Of one that seekes to be stellified being no Pithagorian.
               AN vse there was among some Pithagorians,
               If we giue credit to the best Historians:
               How they that would obserue the course of Starres,
               To purge the vapors, that our cleere sight tarres,
               And bring the braine vnto a settled quiet,
               Did keepe a wondrous strict and sparing dyet,
               Drinke water from the purest heads of springs,
               Eate Hearbs and Flowers, not taste of liuing things:
               And then to this scant fare, their bookes applying,
               They call'd this sparing Dyet, Stellifying.
               Then thinkest thou, professed Epicure,
               That neuer couldest vertuous paines endure,
               That eat'st fat Venson, bowzest Claret Wine,

               And in a Coach like Vulcans sonne dost ride,

               To leaue that greatest Vertue, for this Vice.

               And while my thought somewhat thereof deuiseth,
               A double doubt within my minde ariseth:
               As first, her skin or fanne which looketh brighter,
               And second whether those her looks be lighter,
               Thē that same Plume wherwith her looks were hidden,
               But if I cleer'd these doubts, I should be chidden.

               And lowring sate, and askt the reason why.
               Loue me, and loue my Dogge, thou didst reply:
               Loue as both should be lou'd. I will, said I,
               And seald it with a kisse. Then by and by,
               Cleer'd were the clouds of thy faire frowning sky.
               Thus small euents, great masteries may try.

               Be neuer dumbe, yet neuer speake too much.
            
            
               
               
                  78 Of a dumbe Horse.
               WHen you and I, Paulus once Hackneys hired,
               Rode late to Rochester, my Hackney tired:
               You that will lose a friend, to coine a iest,
               Play'd thus on me, and my poore tyred beast.
               Marke, in Misacmos Horse, a wondrous change,
               A sudden Metamorphosis most strange.
               His horseway lay at rising of the Sunne,
               And now you plaine may see his Horse is downe.
               Well, Paulus, thus with me, you please to sport,
               But thus againe, your scoffe I can retort.
               Your haire was blacke, and therein was your glory:
               But in two yeeres, it grew all gray and hoary.
               Now like my Hackney worne with too much trauell,
               Mired in the clay, or tired in the grauell.
               While two yeere more ouer your head are runne,
               Your haire is neither blacke, nor gray, 'tis dunne.
            
            
               
                  79 Of Leda that plaid at Tables with her Husband.
               IF tales are told of Leda be not Fables,
               Thou with thy Husband do'st play false at Tables.
               First, thou so cunningly a Die canst slurre,
               To strike an Ace so dead, it cannot sturre.
               Then play thou for a pound, or for a pin,
               High men are low men, still are foysted in.
               
                  Thirdly through, for free entrance is no fearing,
               Yet thou dost ouerreach him still at bearing:
               If poore Almes-ace, or Sincts, haue beene the cast,
               Thou bear'st too many men, thou bear'st too fast.
               Well, Leda, heare my counsell, vse it not,
               Else your faire game may haue so foule a blot,
               That he to lose, or leaue, will first aduenture,
               Then in so shamefull open points to enter.

                  82 Of a Precise Lawyer.
               A Lawyer call'd vnto the Barre but lately,
               Yet one that lofty bare his lookes, and stately,
               And how so e're his minde was in sinceritie,
               His speech and manners shew'd a great austeritie.
               This Lawyer hop'd to be a bidden ghest,
               With diuers others to a Gossips feast.
               Where though that many did by entercourse,
               Exchange sometimes from this, to that discourse:
               Yet one bent brow, and frowne of him was able,
               To gouerne all the talke was at the table.
               His manner was, perhaps to helpe digestion,
               Still to Diuinitie to draw each question:
               In which his tongue extrauagant would range,
               And he pronounced Maxims very strange.
               First, he affirmd, it was a passing folly,
               To thinke one day more then another holy.
               If one said Michaelmas, straight he would chide,
               And tell them they must call it Michaels tide.
               If one had sneezde to say (as is the fashion)
               Christ helpe, 'twas witchcraft, &amp; deseru'd damnation▪
               
               Now when he talked thus, you must suppose,
               The Gossips cup came often from his nose.
               And were it the warme spice, or the warme wether,
               At least he sneezed twice or thrice together.
               A pleasant ghest, that kept his words in minde,
               And heard him sneeze, in scorne said, Keepe behinde
               At which the Lawyer taking great offence,
               Said, Sir, you might haue vs'd saue reuerence.
               
                  I would quoth th' other, saue I fear'd you
               Would then haue cal'd saue reuerence witchcraft too.

               3 When land long quiet, held concealed, passes.
               4 When warre and truce playes passes and repasses,
               5 When Monopolies are giu'n of toyes and trashes:
               6 When courtiers mar good clothes, with cuts &amp; slashes,
               7 Whe Lads shal think it free to ly with Lasses,
               8 Whē clergy romes to buy, sell, none abashes,

               10 Whē prints are set on work, with Greens &amp; Nashes,
               
               11 When Lechers learn to stir vp Lust with lashes,
               When plainnesse vanishes, vainenesse surpasses,
               Some shal grow Elephants, were knowne but Asses.

               YOur seruant Payne, for Legacies hath sued
               Seuen yeeres. I askt him how his matter passes.
               He tels how his Testator left not assets.
               By which plea him th'executor would allude.

                   in this Lawyers French both dull and rude,
               Replide, the plea my learning farre surpasses.
               
                  Yet when reports of both sides I had view'd
               In Forma paper, this I did conclude;
               He was left Pauper, and all his Counsell asses:
               Yet you would giue a hundred crownes or twaine,
               That you could cleare discharge your seruant Paine.
               
            
            
               
                  84 Of one that is vnwilling to lend money.
               WHen I but buy two suites of rich apparrell,
               Or some faire ready horse against the running,
               Rich Quintus, that same Miser, slye and cunning,
               Yet my great friend, begins to pick a quarrell,
               To tell me how his credit is in perill;
               How some great Lord (whose name may not be spoken,
               With him for twenty thousand crownes hath broken.
               Then, with a fained sigh, and signe of sorrow,
               Swearing he thinks these Lords will quite vndoe him,
               He cals his seruant Oliuer vnto him,
               And sends to the Exchange, to take on vse
               One thousand poūds, must needs be paid to morrow.
               Thus would he blind mine eyes with this abuse,
               And thinks, though he was sure I came to borrow,
               That now I needs must shut my mouth for shame.
               Fie, Quintus, fie, then when I speak deny me.
               But to deny me thus, before I try thee,
               Blush and confesse that you be too too blame.

               But ah, such store is enemy to plenty,
               You waste for feare to want, I dare assume it:
               For, while to sell, spend, giue, you make such dainty,
               Keepe corne and cloth, till rat and rot consume it,

                  91 A Tale of a Bayliffe distraining for rent. To my Ladie Rogers.
               
               I Heard a pleasant tale at Cammington,
               There where my Lady dwelt, cald The faire Nun,
               How one that by his office was Deceiuer,
               My tongue oft trips) I should haue said Receiuer,
               Or to speake plaine and true, an arrant Baylie,
               Such as about the Country trauell daily,
               That when the quarter day was two daies past,
               Went presently to gather rents in hast.
               
                  And if, as oft it hapt, he brake good manner,
               He straight would plead the custome of the Mannor,
               Swearing he might distraine all goods and chattell,
               Were it in moueables, or else quick cattell.
               This Bayliffe, comming to a tenement,
               In the Tenants absence, straynd his wife for rent;
               In which the beast so pliable he found,
               He neuer needes to driue her to the pound.
               The Tenant, by intelligence, did ghesse,
               The Bayliffe taken had a wrong distresse:
               And to the Bayliffes wife he went complaining,
               Of this her husbands vsage in distraining;
               Requesting her like curtesies to render,
               And to accept such rent as he would tender.
               She, whether moued with some strange compassion,
               Or that his tale did put her in new passion,
               Accepts his payment like a gentle wench;
               All coyne was currant, English, Spanish, French:
               And when she taken had his sorrie pittance,
               I thinke, that with a kisse she seal'd the quittance.
               Whē next these husbands met, they chaft, they curst▪
               
               Happy was he that could cry Cuckold furst.
               From spightfull words, they fell to daggers drawing▪
               
               And after, each to other threatned lawing.
               Each party seekes to make him strong by faction,
               In seuerall Courts they enter seuerall action,
               Actions of Battery, actions in the Case,
               With riots, routes, disturbed all the place.
               Much bloud, much money had been spilt and spent,
               
                  About this foolish straining for the rent;
               Saue that a gentle Iustice of the Peace,
               Willing to cause such foolish quarrels cease,
               Preuail'd so with the parties by entreatie,
               Of concord both agreed to haue a treatie:
               And both refer'd the matter to the Iustice,
               Who hauing well obseru'd what a iest is:
               To thinke two Cuckolds were so fairely parted,
               Each hauing tane the blow, that neuer smarted,
               He charged each of them shake hands together,

                  2 Of the Bishopricke of Landaffe.
               A Learned Prelate late dispos'd to laffe,
               Hearing me name the Bishop of Landaffe:
               
                  You should say, he aduising well hereon,
               Call him Lord Aff: for all the land is gone.
            
            
               
                  3 Of Don Pedro's Dyet drinke.
               
                  DOn Pedro drinkes to no man at the boord,
               Nor once a taste doth of his cup affoord.
               Some thinke it pride in him: but see their blindnesse
               I know therein, his Lordship doth vs kindnesse.
            
            
               
                  4 Of Leda and Balbus.
               
               
                  LEda was Balbus queane, yet might shee haue denide it.
               She weds him, now what meanes hath Leda left to hide it?
            
            
               
                  5 Of Cinna his Gossip cup.
               WHen I with thee, Cinna, doe dine or sup,
               Thou still do'st offer me thy Gossips cup:
               And though it sauour well, and be well spiced,
               Yet I to taste therof am not enticed.
               Now sith you needs will haue me cause alledge,
               While I straine curt'sie in that cup to pledge:
               One said, thou mad'st that cup so hote of spice,
               That it had made thee now a widdower twice.
               I will not say 'tis so, nor that I thinke it:
               But good Sir, pardon me, I cannot drinke it.
            
            
               
               
                  6 Of Leda's Religion.
               MY louely Leda, some at thee repining,
               Askt me vnto what sect thou art inclining?
               Which doubts shall I resolue among so many,
               Whether to none, to one, to all, to any?
               Surely one should be deem'd a false accusant,
               That would appeach Leda for a Recusant.
               Her fault according to her former vsing,
               Was noted more in taking, then refusing.
               For Lent, or Fasts, she hath no superstition,
               For if she haue not chang'd her old condition:
               Be it by night in bed, in day in dish,
               Flesh vnto her more welcome is then Fish.
               Thou art no Protestant, thy fals-hood saith,
               Thou canst not hope to saue thy selfe by faith.
               Well, Leda, yet to shew my good affection,
               I le say thy sect is of a double section.
               A Brownist louely browne, thy face and brest,
               The Families of Loue, in all the rest.
            
            
               
                  7 That fauorites helpe the Church.
               OF late I wrote after my wanton fashion,
               That fauourites consume the Churches rents:
               But mou'd in conscience with retraction,
               Ile shew how sore that rashnes me repents.
               For noting in my priuate obseruation,
               
                  What rents and schismes among vs dayly grow:
               No hope appeares of reconciliation,
               By helpe of such as can, or such as know.
               My Muse must sing, although my soule laments,
               That Fauorites increase the Churches rents.
            
            
               
                  8 Of Cinna his courage.
               PVre Cinna saith, and proudly doth professe,
               That if the quarrell he maintaines be good:
               No man more valiant is to spend his bloud,
               No man can dread of death, of danger lesse.
               But if the cause be bad, he doth confesse,
               His heart is cold, and cowardly his moode.
               Well, Cinna, yet this cannot be withstood,
               Thou hast but euill lucke, I shrewdly gesse,
               That biding whereas brawles are bred most rife,
               Thou neuer hadst good quarrell all thy life.
            
            
               
                  9 Of a Lawyer that deseru'd his fee.
               
                  SExtus retain'd a Sergeant at the Lawes,
               With one good Fee in an ill-fauor'd cause.
               The matter bad, no Iudge nor Iury plyent,
               The verdit clearely past against the Clyent.
               With which he chaft, and swore he was betray'd,
               Because for him the Sergeant little said:
               
                  And of the Fee, he would haue barr'd him halfe.
               Whereat the Sergeant wroth, said, Dizzard Calfe,
               Thou would'st, if thou hadst wit, or sence to see,
               Confesse I had deseru'd a double Fee,
               That stood and blushed there in thy behalfe.

               For euer more thou sai'st, my Lord, my Father.
            
            
               
                  11 Against Lynus a writer.
               I Heare that Lynus growes in wondrous choller,
               Because I said, he wrote but like a scholler.
               If I haue said so, Linus, I must grant it,
               What ere I speake thy scholler-ship concerning,
               I neuer thought, or meant, that thou hast learning:
               But that hereof may grow some more recitall,
               I'le teach thee how to make mee full requitall.
               Say thou to breed me equall spight and choller,
               
                  Misacmos neuer writes, but like a scholler.
            
            
               
                  12 Of Don Pedros bonds.
               
                  DOn Pedro cares not in what bonds he enter.
               Then I to trust Don Pedro soone will venter.
               
                  For no man can of bonds stand more secure,
               Then he that meanes to keepe his paiment sure.

               Why? If one names a Iax, your lips doe water.
               There was the place of your first loue and meeting,
               There first you gaue your Mistris such a greeting,
               As bred her scorne, your shame, and others lafter,
               And made her feele it twenty fortnights after:
               Then thanke their wit, that make the place so sweet,
               That for your Hymen you thought place so meet.
               But meet not Maids at Madam Cloacina,

               THat heau'ns are voide, &amp; that no gods there are,
               Rich Paulus saith, and all his proofe is this:

               Oh, how he beates his brests, and wring his hands!
               How feruently for Cosmus health he pray'd!
               What worthy Almes he vow'd, on that condition:
               But when his pangs a little were allayd,

                  18 Of the corne that rained.
               I Handled, tasted, saw it with mine eyes,
               The graine that lately fell downe from the skies:
               Yet what it tok'ned could I not deuise,
               And many doubts did in my minde arise.
               At last, I thus resolu'd, it signifies
               That this is our sole meane, to mend this dearth,
               To aske from heau'n, that we doe lacke on earth.
            
            
               
                  19 To his wife, at the birth of his sixt Child.
               THe Poet Martiall made a speciall sute
               Vnto his Prince, to grant him vnder seale,
               Right of three children, which they did impute
               A kinde of honour, in their Common-weale.
               But for such sute, my selfe I need not trouble,
               For thou do'st seale to me this Patent double.

               KInde Marcus, me to supper lately bad,
               And to declare how well to vs he wishes,
               The roome was strow'd with Roses and with Rushes,
               And all the cheere was got, that could be had.
               Now in the midst of all our dainty dishes,
               Me thinke, said he to me, you looke but sad,
               Alas (said I) 'tis to see thee so mad,
               To spoile the skies of Fowles, the seas of fishes,
               The land of beasts, and be at so much cost,
               For that which in one houre will all be lost.
               That entertainment that makes me most glad,
               Is not the store of stew'd, boyl'd, bak't and rost.
               But sweet discourse, meane fare; &amp; then beleeue me,
               To make to thee like cheere, shall neuer grieue me.

                  COsmus, when I among thine other vices,
               That are in nature foule, in number many,
               Aske thee what is the reason thee entices,
               To be so basely pinching for thy penny?

               Not to enioy the wealth that thou hast wonne:
               But saue, as if thy soule were in thy purse?
               Thou straight reply'st, I saue all for my sonne.
               Alas, this re-confirmes what I said rather:

               IF men ought those in dutie to commend,
               That questions of Religion seeke to end,
               Then I to praise our Vintners doe intend.
               For Question is twixt Writer old and latter,
               If wine alone, or if wine mixt with water,
               Should of the blessed Sacrament be matter?
               Some ancient Writers wish it should be mingled,
               But latter men, with much more zeale in kindled,
               Will haue wine quite and cleane from water singled.
               Our zealous Vintners here, growne great Diuines,
               To finde which way antiquitie enclines,
               For pure zeale mix with water all our wines.
               Well, plainly to tell truth, and not to flatter,
               I find our wines are much the worse for water.

               MAdam, I read to you a little since,
               The story of a Knight that had incurd
               The deep displeasure of a mighty Prince:
               For feare of which, long time he neuer sturd,
               Till watching once the King that came frō Chappel,
               His little sonne fast by him, with his Gardon,
               Entic'd the Infant to him with an apple;
               So caught him in his armes, and su'd for pardon:
               
                  Then you shall turne your angry frown from lafter,
               As oft as in mine armes you see your daughter.

               COncerning th' wiues hold this a certaine rule,
               That if at first, you let them haue the rule,

                  38 Why Paulus takes so much Tobacco.

               At euery Boothe, and Alehouse that they come,
               They call for Herring straight, they must haue some.

               Herring they aske, they praise, they eate, they buy;
               No price of Herring can be held too hie.
               But, when among them i

               Those Herring
                     •
                   that they bought, to sell are 
                     •

               Then giue them Herring, Poh, away with these:
               Pree dee good Hostis, giue's some English Cheese.
               Hence I haue learn'd the cause, and see it clearely,
               Why Paulus takes Tobacco, buyes it 
                     •
                  earely,
               At Tippling-houses, where he eates and drinks,
               That euery roome straight of Tobacco stinks,
               He swears tis salue for all diseases bred,
               It strengthens ones weake back, comforts the head,
               Dulls much flesh-appetite, tis cordiall durable,
               
                  It cures that ill, which some haue thought incurable▪
               
               Thus while proud Paulus hath Tobacco praised,
               The price of eu'ry pound, a pound is raised.
               And why's all this? because he loues it well?
               No: but because himselfe hath store to sell.
               But hauing sold all his; he will pronounce
               The best in Cane not worth a groat an ounce.

               Suffiseth me, thou think'st I doe not lye.
               For, let her husband write so, for my life,
               He flattereth himselfe more then his wife.
            
            
               
                  45 Sir Iohn Raynsfords confession.
               
                  RAynsford, a Knight, fit to haue seru'd king Arthu
                        •
                     ,
               
               And in Queene Maries dayes a demy Martyr:
               
                  For though both then, before, and since he turn'd,
               (Yet sure, per ig
                        ••••
                      hanc, he might be burn'd.)
               This Knight agreed with those of that profession,
               And went, as others did, to make confession:
               Among some P
                        •
                     ccadilios, he confest,
               That same sweet sinne, that some but deeme a Iest,
               And told, how by good help of bawdes and varlets,
               Within 10. months he had sixe times twelue harlots▪
               
               The Priest, that at the tale was halfe astonished,
               With graue &amp; ghostly counsell him admonished
               To fast, and pray, to driue away that diuell,
               That was to him causer of so great euill,
               That the lewd spirit of Lecherie, no question,
               Stird vp his lust, with many a lewd suggestion:
               A filthy Fiend, said he, most foule and odious,
               Nam'd, as appeares, in holy writs, Asmodius.
               
               Thus, with some Pennanto that was ne're performed,
               Away went that same Knight, smally reformed.
               Soone after this, ensued religions change,
               That in the Church bred alteration strange,
               And Raynsford, with the rest, follow'd the streame.
               The Priest went rouing round about the Realme.
               This Priest, in clothes disguis'd himselfe did hide,
               
                  
                     •
                  et Raynsford, three yeers after him had spyde,
               And layd vnto his charge, and sorely prest him,
               To tell if'twere not he that had confest him.
               The Priest, though this Knights words did sore him daunt,
               Yet what he could not wel deny, did grant,
               And prayd him not to punish, or controul
                     •
                  
               
               That he had done for safety of his soule.
               
                  No, knaue, quoth he, I will no harme procure thee,
               Vpon my Worship here I doe assure thee:
               I onely needs must laugh at thy great folly,
               That would'st perswade with me to be so holy;
               To chastise mine owne flesh, to fast, and pray,
               To driue the spirit of Lechery away.
               'Sownds, foolish knaue, I fasted not, nor prayd,
               Yet is that spirit quite gone from me, he said:
               If thou couldst helpe me to that spirit againe,
               Thou shouldst a hundred pound haue for thy paine.
               That lustie Lord of Lecherie Asmodius,
               
               That thou cal'st odious, I doe count commodious▪
               
            
            
               
                  46 A pretty question of Lazarus soule well answered.
               ONce on occasion two good friends of mine
               Did meete at meate, a Lawyer and Diuine:
               Both hauing eaten well to helpe digestion,
               To this Diuine, the Lawyer put this question:
               When Lazarus in graue foure dayes did stay,
               Where was his soule? in heauen, or hell I pray?
               Was it in hell? Thence no redemption is.
               And if in heauen: would Christ abate his blisse?
               Sir, said the Preacher, for a short digression,
               First, answere me one point, in your profession:
               If so his heyres and he had falne to strife,
               Whose was the land, if he came backe from life?
               This latter question mou'd them all to lafter,
               And so they drunke one to another after.

               And going for supplyes into the West,
               My hoast to whom I was a welcome ghest,
               Makes me great cheere, but when I parted thence,
               My trustie seruant William tooke offence:
               (Though now God wot, it was too late to spare)
               That in the shot things too high prized are.
               And namely for two Rabbets twenty pence.

               New kill'd, and newly come from Alborne chase:
               For that good fare, good paiment is most meete.
               I willing to make short their long debate,
               Bade my man pay the reck'ning at his rate:
               Adding, I know, a miser of his money,

               MEn talking, as oft times it comes to passe,
               How dangerous 'tis now to heare a Masse;
               A valiant Knight swore for a thousand pound,
               He would not present at a Masse be found.
               A Noble Lord stood by, and hearing it▪
               
               Said, Sir, I then should much condemne your wit.

                  56 Of a Preacher that sings Placebo.
               
               A Smooth-tong'd Preacher that did much affect
               To be reputed of the purest sect.
               Vnto these times great praises did afford,
               That brought, he said, the sunne-shine of the Word.
               The sunne-shine of the Word, this he extold,
               The sunne-shine of the Word, this still he told.
               But I that well obseru'd what slender fruits
               Haue growne of all their preaching and disputes,
               Pray God they bring vs not, when all is done,
               Out of Gods blessing, into this warme sunne.
               For sure, as some of them haue vs'd the matter,
               Their sunne-shine is but moone-shine in the water.

               And in your foreheads your faults be written.

                  59 Of Don Pedroe's threats.
               
                  DOn Pedro thinkes I scorne him in my Rime,
               And vowes, if he can proue I vse detraction,
               Of the great scandall he will haue his action:
               I that desir'd to cleere me of the crime,
               When I was askt, said, No, my Lord, I haue not.
               Then sweare, said he, Not so, my Lord, I cannot.
               Since that I neuer heard newes of this action:
               Wherefore, I thinke, he hath his satisfaction.

               The seruant killed, to the Masters terror:
               What time his eye deceiu'd with rich apparell,

               Both for his safety, and his reputation:
               Remou'd the fire, and stay'd that execution:
               And for his sake, made peace with all his Nation.

               Though 'tis too true, yet say not so for shame,
               For I would wish to cleere me of the blame:
               That each time cost you but a hundred pence.

               To make all Saints after his pype to daunce:
               
                  It speaking, which as he himselfe aduances,
               To act his speech with Iestures, lo, it chances,
               Downe fals the Pulpit, sore the man is brused,
               Neuer was Fryer, and Pulpit more abused.
               Then beare with me, though yet to you a stranger,
               To warne you of the like, nay greater danger.
               For though none feare the falling of those sparkes,

               With Female Planets, sore your foote may trip,
               That in your lofty Caprioll and turne,
               Their motion may make your dimension burne.

               TO loue you, Paulus, I was well enclin'd:
               But euer since you honour did require,
               I honor'd you, because 'twas your desire:

                  70 Of the commodities that men haue by their Marriage.
               A Fine yong Clerke, of kinne to Fryer Frappert,
               
               Prompt of his tongue, of person neat and dappert▪
               
               Not deepely read, yet were he put vnto it,
               One that could say his seruice, and would doe it.
               His markes &amp; haire, show'd him of excellent carriage
               This man one day hap'ned to talke of marriage,
               And prou'd not onely, that 'tis honorable,
               But that the ioyes thereof are admirable.
               He told the tale to me, and other friends,
               And straight I learn'd it at my fingers ends.
               Which ioyes that you may better vnderstand,
               
                  
                     
                        〈1 paragraph〉
                     
                  I'le place on each finger of my hand.
               Foure ioyes, he said, on married Priests he casts,
               A wife, and friends, and coyne, and children last.
               And first the wife, see how at bed, at boord,
               What comfort, and what ioyes, she doth affoord.
               Then for her friends, what ioy can be more deare,
               Then louing friends, dwell they farre off or neare.
               A third ioy then it is, to haue the portion,
               Well got, and void of strife, fraud or extortion.
               And fourthly, those sweet Babes, that call on Dad,
               Oh, how they ioy the soule, and make it glad!
               But now, Sir, there remaines one obseruation,
               That well deserues your due consideration.
               Marke then againe, I say, for so 'twere meete,
               Which of these ioyes are firme, and which doe fleet
               
                  First, for the wife, sure no man can deny it,
               That for most part, she stickes most surely by it.
               But for thy friends, when they should most auaile you,
               By death, or fortunes change, oft times they faile you.
               Then for the portion, without more forecast,
               Whiles charge encreaseth, money failes as fast.
               And last the children, most of them out-liue you,
               But ill brought vp, they often liue to grieue you.
               Now marke vpon the fingers,
                     
                        〈1 paragraph〉

                  71 To Marcus that would borrow.
               YOu sent to me, Marcus, for twenty marke:
               But to that sute, I would by no meanes harke:
               But straight next day, you sent your man in post,
               To tell me how a Lord with you would host.
               And I must lend, to entertaine this State,
               Some Basons, Ewres, and some such other plate.
               Are you a Foole? Or thinke you me a foole,
               That I should now be set againe to schoole?
               Were not my wisedome, worthy to be wondred,
               Denying twenty markes, to lend one hundred?
            
            
               
                  72 To his wife after they had beene married foure yeere.
               TWo Prētiships with thee I now haue been,
               Mad times, sad times, glad times, our life hath seen,
               
                  Souls we haue wroght 4. payre since our first meeting
               Of which, 2. soules, sweet soules, were to be fleeting,
               My workemanship so well doth please thee still,
               Thou wouldst not graunt me freedome by thy will:
               And Ile confesse such vsage I haue found,
               Mine heart yet ne're desir'd to be vnbound.
               But though my selfe am thus thy Prentice vow'd,
               My dearest Mall, yet thereof be not proud,
               Nor claime no Rule thereby; ther's no such cause:
               For Plowden, who was father of the Lawes
               Which yet are read and rul'd by his Enditings,
               Doth name himselfe a Prentice in his writings,
               And I, if you should challenge vndue place,
               Could learne of him to alter so the case:
               I plaine would proue, I still kept due priority,
               And that good wiues are still in their minority:
               But far from thee, my deare, be such Audacitie:
               I doubt more thou dost blame my dul Capacitie,
               That though I trauaile true in my vocation,
               I growe yet worse and worse at th'occupation.
            
            
               
                  73 Of a Bequest without a Legacy.
               IN hope some Lease or Legacy to gaine,
               You gaue old Titus yeerely ten pound pension.
               Now he is dead, I heare thou dost complaine,
               That in his will of thee he made no mention.
               Cease this complaint that shewes thy base intention.
               He left thee more, then some he lou'd more deerely,
               For he hath left thee ten pound pension yeerely.
            
            
               
               
                  74 Of one that lent money on sure band.
               WHen Lynus little store of coyne is spent,
               And no supply of office or of Rent,
               He comes to Titus knowne a wary spender,
               A pleasant wit, but no great money-lender,
               And prest him very hard for twenty pound,
               For which small kindnesse he were greatly bound,
               And lest (quoth he) you deeme it might presumption,
               If I should offer you my bare assumption,
               I sweare All-hallows, I wil make repayment,
               Yea though I pawne mine Armour and my Rayment,
               And for your more assurance, you shall haue
               What Obligation you your selfe will craue,
               Or Bill or Bond your payment to performe,
               Recognizance, Statute or any forme.
               Now Titus by report so well did know him,
               That he might scant trust him so far as throw him,
               And said he should haue so much at his hands,
               Forthwith if he might poynt the forme and bands.
               Agree'd, quoth Lynus straight, and doth him thanke.
               But Titus brings a Foorme of foure Inch-Plancke,
               Two of the Gard might scantly well it lift,
               And ere that Lynus well perceiu'd the drift,
               
                  
                     •
                  ast to that Foorme he bindes him hands and feete:
               Then brought the mony forth and let him see't,
               And sware till, he his fashions did reforme,
               None other bands could serue nor other forme.
            
            
               
               
                  75 Of light Merchandize.
               IN Rome a Cryer had a Wench to sell,
               Such as in common Stewes are wont to dwell,
               Her name, nor his, I shall not neede to tell.
               But hauing held her long at little price,
               And thinking that some chapman to entice,
               He clipt her in his armes as nothing nice,
               And so he kist her more then once or twice.
               What might he gaine, thinke you, by this deuice?
               One that before had offered fifty shilling,
               To giue one fift part, seemed now vnwilling.

               And hauing, with oathes, his speeches bound:
               Thus would he speak: I would at twelue score pricks,
               Haue shot all day an arrow of a pound,
               Haue shot the flight full fortie score and sixe,
               
                  
                     •
                   would haue ouer-lifted all the Gard,
               Out-throwne them at the barre, the sledge, the stone,
               And he that is in wrestling held most hard,
               
                  
                     •
                   would in open plaine haue ouerthrowne.
               Now, say some by, Was Titus e're so strong?
               Who he? the weakest man a hundred among.
               Why tels he then such lyes in serious sort,
               What he could do? Nay, sure 'twas true, though sport.
               He said not he could doe. That were a fable.

               TO liue in Lust I make not my profession,
               Nor in my Verse, my vices to defend:
               But rather by a true and plaine confession,
               To make men know my meaning is to mend.
               I hate, and am my selfe that most I hate,
               I load my selfe, yet striue to be discharged,
               Like sterelesse ship vnstai'd, runnes my estate,
               Bound by my selfe, I sue to be enlarged.
               No certaine shape, my fancies doth enflame:
               A hundred causes kindle my affection,
               If sober looke doe show a modest shame,
               Straight to those eyes my soule is in subiection.
               A wanton looke, no lesse my heart doth pierce,
               Because it showes a pleasant inclination.
               If she be coy like Sabines sharpe and fierce,
               I thinke such coynesse, deepe dissimulation.
               If she be learn'd, I honour gifts so rare,
               If ignorant, I loue a milde simplicitie.
               If she doe praise my writings, and compare
               Them with the best, in her I take felicitie.
               If she dispraise my Verses, and their Maker,
               To win her liking, I my loue would lend her.
               Goes she well grac't? Her gate would make me take her▪
               
               If ill, perhaps to touch a man, would mend her.

               And dance Carantoes with a comely grace,

               Yet comlier sports are found in statures small,
               Thus long and short haue aye my liking bred.
               If she goe plaine, then what a piece were this?
               Were she attyr'd, if braue, I loue her brauery,

               Sweet Lady, you must sweat, or else, I sweare it,

               Why should one sell, say they, that lets to vse?
               The Broker driuen to seeke some new excuse,
               Did study first, and smyling, thus replide,
               His Worships beasts, and sheepe, and Hindes there dyde;
               Since which, he neuer could the place abide.
               Now though in this the foolish Broker lyde,
               Yet the report thereof did so much harme,
               That now, poore Marius cannot sell his Farme.

               Well, sith encountring, he so faire doth misse,
               He sets not till he nine and fortie is.
               And thinking now his rest would sure be doubled,
               He lost it by the hand, with which sore troubled,
               He ioynes now all his stocke, vnto his stake,
               That of his fortune, he full proofe may make.
               At last both eldest hand and fiue and fifty,
               He thinketh now or neuer (thriue vnthrifty.)

               Now must he seeke new spoile to set his rest,

               His land, his plate he pawnes, he sels his leases,
               To patch, to borrow▪ and shift, he neuer ceases.
               Till at the last, two Catch-poles him encounter,
               And by arrest, they beate him to the Counter.
               Now Marcus may set vp, all rests securely:
               For now he's sure to be encountred surely.

               Hunts after youthfull company, entycing
               Them to the sports of bowling, carding, dycing:

                  Marcus, by one and one sell all his horses.

                  8 Of a Lady that sought remedy at the Bathe.
               A Lady that none name, nor blame none hath,
               Came the last yeere with others to the Bathe:
               Her person comely was, good was her feature,
               In beauty, grace and speech, a louely creature.
               Now as the Lady in the water staid,
               A plaine man fell a talking with her maid,
               That lean'd vpon the rayle, and askt the reason,
               Why that faire Lady vs'd the Bathe, that season?
               Whether 'twere lamenesse, or defect in hearing,
               Or some more inward euill, not appearing?
               No, said the Maid to him, beleeue it well,
               That my faire Mistris sound is as a Bell.
               But of her comming, this is true occasion,
               An old Physician mou'd her by perswasion.
               These Bathes haue power to strengthen that debility,
               That doth in man or woman breed sterrilitie.
               
                  Tush, said the man, with plaine &amp; short discourse,
               Your Mistris might haue tane a better course.
               Let her to Oxford, to the Vniuersitie,
               Where yong Phisicians are, and such diuersitie
               Of toward spirits that in all acts proceede,
               Much fitter then the Bathe is for the deede.
               No, no, that will not serue, the Maid replide,
               For her, that Physike hath already tride.

                  10 Of Faustus the Fault-finder.
               OF all my Verses, Faustus still complaines,
               I writ them carelesly: and why forsooth?
               Because, he saith, they goe so plaine and smooth.
               It showes that I for them ne're beat my braines.
               I, that mens errors neuer loue to sooth,
               Said, they that say so, may be thought but noddies.
               For sample marke, said I, your Mistris bodies,
               That sit so square, and smooth down to her raines.

               Then with old Ellens double-welted frock,
               That sits like an old felt on a new block.
               Who cannot write, ill iudge of Writers vaines.
               The worke of Taylers hands, and Writers wits,
               Was hardest wrought, when as it smoothest sits.
            
            
               
                  11 Of an ill Physician for the body, that became a worse Surgeon for the soule.
               A Certaine Mountebanke, or paltry Leach,
               Finding his Physick furdred not his thrift,
               Thought with himselfe to find some further drift.
               And though the skill were farre aboue his reach,
               He needs would proue a Priest, and falls to preach.
               But patching Sermons with a sorry shift,
               As needs they must that ere they learne will teach:
               At last, some foes so neerely doe him sift,
               And of such words and deeds did him appeach,
               As from his Liuing quite they did him lift,
               And of the Patron straight they begd the gift:
               And so the Mountebanke did ouer-reach.
               Who when he found he was pursu'd so swift,
               Gaue place vnto so sharpe and fierce a breach:
               Shutting vp all with this shrewd muttering speach,
               Well, though, said he, my Liuing I haue lost,
               
                  Yet many a good mans life this losse shall cost.
               A stander by, that would be thought officious,
               Straight, as an heynous matter of complaint,
               Doth with his speech the Iustices acquaint:
               Alleaging, as it seem'd, indeed suspicious,
               That to the State his meaning was pernitious.
               The Leech thus touched with so shrewd a Taint,
               Yet in his looke nor answer did, nor faint;
               Protesting, that his mind was not malicious.
               But if the course that he must take be vicious,
               He flat affirmed it was curst constraint:

               BEcause a witty Writer of this time,
               Doth make some mention in a pleasant rime,
               
                  Of Lepidus and of his famous dogge,
               Thou Momus, that dost loue to scoffe and cogge,
               Prat'st amongst base companions and giue'st out,
               That vnto me herein, is meant aflout.
               Hate makes thee blinde, Momus, I dare be sworne,
               He meant to me his loue, to thee his scorne,
               Put on thy enuious spectacles and see,
               Whom doth he scorne therein, the dogge or mee:
               The Dogge is grac't, compared with great Bankes,
               Both beasts right famous, for their pretty prankes,
               Although in this, I grant, the dogge was worse,
               He onely fed my pleasure, not my purse:
               Yet that same Dogge, I may say this and boast it,
               He found my purse with gold when I haue lost it.
               Now for my selfe, some fooles like thee may iudge,
               That at the name of Lepidus I grudge,
               No sure: so farre I thinke it from disgrace,
               I wisht it cleare to me and to my race:

               For sure the Gudgen is the better meat.

               For beauty much, for loue to be more wondred,
               Su'd for his Spouse, and told she was his wife.
               The Tyrant pleasant to see so faire a suter,
               Doth kisse her, and imbrace her, and salute her.
               Then makes, nay mocks, a loue too kinde, too cruell
               She must, to saue her husband from proscription,
               Grant him one night, her husbands chiefest Iewell:
               And what he meant, he shewd by lewd description:
               Vowing, except he might his pleasure haue,
               No meanes would serue, her husbands life to saue.
               Oh motion! louing thoughts, no thoughts, but thorn

                  Or she her selfe subiect to thousand scornes.
               Both feares doe touch a Noble Matron neerely.
               Loe, yet an act, performed by this woman,
               Worthy a woman, worthy more a Romane:
               To show more then her selfe she lou'd her Spouse,
               She yeelds her body to this execution.
               Come, Tyrant, come, performe thy damned vowes,
               Her single heart hath doubled thy pollution.
               Thou pollute her? No, foole, thou art beguiled:
               She in thy filthy lap lies vndefiled.
               Honour of Matrons, of all wiues a mirror!
               He sweare with thee, thy husband weares no horne:
               Or if this act, conuince mine oath of error,
               Twas a most precious one, an Vnicorne.
               If ought I know by hearing or by reading,
               This act Lucretias deed is farre exceeding.
            
            
               
                  36 Of the Lady that lookt well to her borders.
               A Lady of great Birth, great reputation,
               Clothed in seemely, &amp; most sumptuous fashion:
               Wearing a border of rich Pearle and stone,
               Esteemed at a thousand crownes alone,
               To see a certaine Interlude, repaires,
               Through a great prease, vp a darke paire of staires.
               Her Page did beare a Torch that burnt but dimly.
               Two cozening mates, seeing her deckt so trimly,
               Did place themselues vpon the stayres to watch her,
               
                  And thus they laid their plot to cunny-catch her:
               One should as 'twere by chance strike out the light;
               While th'other that should stand beneath her, might
               Attempt, (which modestie to suffer lothes)
               Rudely to thrust his hands vnder her clothes.
               That while her hands repeld such grosse disorders,
               His mate might quickly slip away the borders.
               Now though this act to her was most displeasant,
               Yet being wise (as womens wits are present:)
               Straight on her borders both her hands she cast,
               And with all her force she held them fast.
               Villaines, she cryde, you would my borders haue:
               But I'le saue them tother it selfe can saue:
               Thus, while the Page had got more store of light,
               The coozening mates, for feare slipt out of sight.
               Thus her good wit, their cunning ouer-matcht.
               Were not these conycatchers conycatcht?

               WHen first my mother bore me in her wombe,
               She went to make inquirie of the gods,
               First of my birth, and after of my tombe.
               All answerd true, yet all their words had ods.
               
                  Phoebus affirm'd, a Male childe should be borne:
               
                  Mars said it would be female, Iuno neither:
               But I came forth, alas, to natures scorne,
               
                  Hermaphrodite, as much as both together.
               Then for my death, Iuno foretold the sword:
               
                  
                  Phoebus assign'd me drowning for my fa

               A Tree fast by a brooke I needs would clime,
               My sword slipt out, and while no heede I tooke,
               My side fell on the point, and at that same time,
               My foote in boughs, my head hang'd in the brooke:
               That I thus borne a Male, a Female neither,

               I tooke it of him onely for a tryall,
               And finde it too high prised for a Royall.
               Thus neuer changing countenance, she doth rise▪
               
               With outward silence, inward anger choking.
               And going to her closer, she espies
               
                  Tobacco in a pype, yet newly smoking.
               She takes the pype, her malice her prouoking,
               And laps it in his linnen, comming backe,
               And so the Pedler put it in his packe,
               And packes away, and ioyes that with his wyle,
               He had regayn'd the stuffe, yet gayn'd his pleasure.
               But hauing walked scarcely halfe a mile,
               His packe did smoke, and smell so out of measure,
               That opening it vnto his great displeasure,
               He found by that Tobacco pype too late,
               The fiery force of feeble female hate.
               And seeking then some remedy by lawes,
               Vnto a neighbour Iustice he complaines:
               But when the Iustice vnderstood the cause,
               In her examination taking paines,
               And found 'twas but a fetch of womens braines:
               The cause dismist, he bids the man beware,
               To deale with women that could burne his ware.

               And liue so when they list, at seuerall rate;
               But I'le endure thee, Mall, on no condition,
               To sue with me a writ of such partition.
               Twice seuen yeeres since, most solemnly I vow'd,

               I Prays'd the speech, but cannot now abide it,
               That war is sweet, to those that haue not try'd it:
               For I haue prou'd it now, and plainely see't,
               It is so sweet, it maketh all things sweet.

               Heere viler meat, worse cookt, ne're makes me sicke.

               A hedge the Curtaine, Canopy a Willow.
               There if a child but cry, oh what a spite!
               Heere we can brooke three larums in one night.
               There homely roomes must be perfum'd with Roses:
               Here match and powder ne're offends our noses.
               There from a storme of raine we run like Pullets:
               Heere we stand fast against a showre of bullets.
               Lo then how greatly their opinions erre,
               That thinke there is no great delight in warre:

               YOu wisht me to a wife, faire, rich and young,
               That had the Latine, French and Spanish tongue.
               I thank't, and told you I desir'd none such,
               And said, One Language may be tongue too much.
               Then loue I not the learned? yes as my life;
               A learned mistris, not a learned wife.

               MArke here (my Mall) how in this dozen lines,
               Thus placed are the twelue celestiall Signes:
               And first, the Ram beares rule in head and face,
               The stiffe-neckt Bull in neck doth hold his place,
               And Twins mine armes and hands do both imbrace.
               Then Cancer keepes the small ribs and the brest,
               And Leo back and heart hath aye possest.
               Then Virgo claimes the entrailes and the panch,
               
                  Libra the nauell, reynes, and either hanch.
               
                  Scorpio pretends power in the priuy parts,
               Both thighes are pierst with Sagitaries darts.
               Then Capricorne to knees his force doth send,
               
                  Aquarius doth to legges his vertue lend.
               
                  Pisces beneath vnto the feet discend.
               Thus each part is possest; now tell me, Mall,
               
               Where lies thy part? in which of these? In all.
               In all? content. Yet sure thou art more iealous
               Of Leo's part and Scorpio's, then their fellowes.
            
            
               
                  9 Against Swearing.
               IN elder times an ancient custome was,
               To sweare in weighty matters by the Masse.
               But when the Masse went downe (as old men note)
               They sware then by the crosse of this same grote.
               
                  And when the Crosse was likewise held in scorne,
               Then by their faith, the common oath was sworne.
               Last, hauing sworne away all faith and troth,
               Only God dam'n them is their common oath.
               Thus custome kept decorum by gradation,
               That losing Masse, Crosse, Faith, they find damnation.
            
            
               
                  10 Of little pitie.
               WHen noble Essex, Blount and Danuers died,
               One saw them suffer, that had heard them tried:
               And sighing, said; When such braue souldiers dye,
               Is
                     •
                  t not great pitie, thinke you? No, said I:
               There is no man of sense in all the citie,
               Will say, 'Tis great, but rather little pitie.
            
            
               
                  11 Of a Booke called the Gentle Craft.
               I Past this other day through Pauls Church-yard,
               And heard some reade a booke, and reading laught,
               The title of the booke was Gentle Craft.
               But when I markt the matter with regard,
               A new-sprung branch that in my minde did graft,
               And thus I said, Sirs, scorne not him that writ it:
               A gilded blade hath oft a dudgeon haft,
               And well I see, this writer roues a shaft
               Neere fairest marke, yet happily not hit it.
               For neuer was the like booke sold in Poules,
               If so with Gentle Craft it could perswade

                  12 Of the games that haue beene in request at the Court.
               I Heard one make a pretty Obseruation,
               How games haue in the Court turn'd with the fashion
               The first game was the best, when free from crime,
               The Courtly gamesters all were in their prime:
               The second game was Post, vntill with posting
               They paid so fast, 'twas time to leaue their boasting.
               Then thirdly follow'd heauing of the Maw,
               A game without Ciuility or Law,
               An odious play, and yet in Court oft seene,
               A sawcy knaue to trump both King and Queene.
               Then follow'd Lodam, hand to hand or quarter,
               At which some maids so ill did keep the Quarter,
               That vnexpected, in a short abode
               They could not cleanly beare away their load.
               Now Noddy follow'd next, as well it might,
               Although it should haue gone before of right.
               At which I saw, I name not any body,
               One neuer had the knaue, yet laid for Noddy.
               The last game now in vse is Bankerupt,
               Which will be plaid at still, I stand in doubt,
               Vntill Lauolta turne the wheele of time,
               And make it come about againe to Prime.

               VNto a stately great outlandish Dame,
               A Messenger from our King Henry came,

                  pli'de, I humbly thanke the King, your Master,
               And would, (such loue his fame in me hath bred,)

                  15 Two witty answers of Bishop Bonner.
               
               
                  BOnner, that late had Bishop beene of London,
               Was bid by one, Good morrow Bishop quondam:
               He with the scoffe, no whit put out of temper,
               Reply'd incontinent, Adieu knaue Semper.
               
               Another in such kinde of scoffing speeches,
               Would beg his tippet, needs, to line his breeches.
               Not so (quoth he) but it may be thy hap,
               To haue a foolish head to line thy cap.
            
            
               
                  16 Of Lynus borrowing.
               
                  LYnus came late to me, sixe crownes to borrow,
               And sware God damn him, hee'd repai't to morrow.
               I knew his word, as currant as his band,
               And straight I gaue to him three crownes in hand;
               This I to giue, this he to take was willing,
               And thus he gaind, and I sau'd fifteene shilling.
            
            
               
                  17 A good answere of the Poet Dant to an Atheist.
               THe pleasant learn'd Italian Poet Dant,
               
               Hearing an Atheist at the Scriptures iest,
               Askt him in iest, which was the greatest beast?
               He simply said; he thought an Elephant.
               
                  Then Elephant (quoth Dant) it were commodious,
               That thou wouldst hold thy peace, or get thee hence,
               Breeding our Conscience scandall and offence
               With thy prophan'd speech, most vile and odious.
               Oh Italy, thou breedst but few such Dants,
               
               I would our England bred no Elephants.
            
            
               
                  18 Of Quintus almes.
               WHen Quintus walketh out into the street,
               As soone as with some begger he doth meete,
               Ere that poore soule to aske his almes hath leasure,
               He first doth chafe and sweare beyond all measure,
               And for the Beadle all about he sends,
               To beare him to Bridewell, so he pretends.
               The Begger quickly out of sight doth goe,
               
                  
                     •
                  ull glad in heart he hath escaped so.
               Then Quintus laughes, and thinks it is lesse charges,
               To sweare an oath or two, then giue a larges.
            
            
               
                  19 Of Marcus his drunken feasting.
               WHen Marcus makes (as oft he doth) a feast,
               The Wine still costs him more then all the rest.
               Were water in this towne as deare as hay,
               His horses should not long at liuery stay.

               Will proue an eating to thy wit and wealth.
            
            
               
                  20 A good iest of a Crow.
               A Baron and a Knight, one day walking
               On Richmond greene, &amp; as they were in talking,
               A Crow, that lighted on the raile by Fortune,
               Stood becking, and cry'd kaw with noise importune.
               This bird, the Baron said, doth you salute,
               Sir Knight, as if to you he had some sute,
               Not vnto me, the Knight reply'd in pleasance,
               'Tis to some Lord he makes so low obeysance.
            
            
               
                  21 Of kissing the foote.
               A Courtier, kinde in speech, curst in condition,
               Finding his fault could be no longer hidden,
               Went to his friend to cleere his hard suspition,
               And fearing lest he might be more then chidden,
               Fell to a flattering and most base submission,
               Vowing to kisse his foote, if he were bidden.
               My foote? (said he) that were too submisse,
               But three foote higher you deserue to kisse.
            
            
               
               
                  22 Of a sawcy Cator.
               A Cator had of late some wild-fowle bought,
               And when vnto his Master them he brought,
               Forthwith the Master smelling nigh the rump,
               Said, Out, thou knaue, these sauour of the pump.
               The man (that was a rude and sawcy Lout)
               What Sir, said he, smell you them thereabout?
               Smell your faire Lady there, and by your fauour,
               Your fortune may meete with a fulsome sauour.
            
            
               
                  23 Of a certaine Man.
               THere was (not certain when) a certaine preacher,
               That neuer learn'd, and yet became a Teacher,
               Who hauing read in Latine thus a Text
               Of erat quidam homo, much perplext,
               He seem'd the same with study great to scan
               In English thus; there was a certaine man.
               
               But now (quoth he) good people, note you this,
               He saith there was, he doth not say there is:
               For in these daies of ours, it is most certaine,
               Of promise, oth, word, deed, no man is certaine:
               Yet by my text you see it comes to passe,
               That surely once a certaine man there was.
               But yet I thinke, in all your Bible no man
               Can finde this text; there was a certaine woman.

               OLd widdow Lesbia, after husbands fiue,
               Yet feeleth Cupids flames in her reuiue.
               And now she takes a gallant youth and trim.
               Alas for her, nay, nay, alas for him.

                  -apace.
               WHo wishes, hopes, and thinks, his wife is true,
               To him one horne, or vnicorne is due.
               Who sees his wife play false, and will not spy it,
               He hath two hornes, and yet he may deny it.
               The man that can indure when all men scorne,
               And pardon open faults, hath treble horne;
               Who brings fine Courtiers oft to see his bride,
               He hath one paire of hornes on either side.
               But he that sweares hee did so happy wiue,
               He can be none of these, let him haue fiue.
            
            
               
                  26 Of cursing Cuckolds.
               A Lord that talked late in way of scorne,
               Of some that ware inuisibly the horne,
               Said he could wish, and did (as for his part)
               All Cuckolds in the Thames, with all his heart.
               But straight a pleasant Knight reply'd to him,
               I hope your Lordship learned hath to swimme.
            
            
               
               
                  27 Of the pillars of the Church.
               IN old time they were the Churches pillars,
               That did excell in learning and in piety,
               And were to youth examples of sobriety,
               Of Christs faire field the true and painefull tillers:
               But where are now the men of that society?
               Are all those tillers dead? those pillars broken?
               No, God forbid such blasphemy be spoken;
               I say, to stop the mouthes of all ill-willers,
               Gods field hath harrowers still, his Church hath pillars,

               OLd Caius sold a wench, to buy a barke.
               Yong Titus gaue the ship, to haue the slut.
               Who makes the better mart, now let vs marke,
               Th' one loues to roue, the tother goes to rut.
            
            
               
                  29 Of Lesbias kissing craft.
               
                  LEsbia with study found a meanes in th' end,
               In presence of her Lord to kisse her friend,
               Each of them kist by turnes a little Whelpe,
               Transporting kisses thus by puppies helpe.
               And so her good old Lord she did beguise:
               Was not my Lord a puppy all the while?
            
            
               
               
                  30 Of sixe sorts of Fasters.
               SIxe sorts of folkes I find vse fasting dayes,
               But of these sixe, the sixt I onely praise.
               The sicke man fasts, because he cannot eate.
               The poore doth fast, because he hath no meate.
               The miser fasts, with mind to mend his store.
               The glutton, with intent to eate the more.
               The hypocrite, thereby to seeme more holy.
               The vertuous, to preuent or punish folly.
               Now he that eateth fast, and drinkes as fast,
               May match these fasters, any but the last.
            
            
               
                  31 Of Cinna.
               
               PVre Cinna gets his wife a maiden Cooke
               With red cheeks, yellow locks, &amp; cheerfull looke.
               What might he meane hereby? I hold my life,
               She dresseth flesh for him, not for his wife.

                  CLaudia, to saue a noble Romans blood,
               Was offred by some friends that wisht his good,
               A iewell of inestimable price;
               But she would not be won by this deuice:
               For she did take his head, and leaue the iewell.
               Was Claudia now more couetous, or cruell?
            
            
               
               
                  33 A rule to Play.
               LAy down your stake at play, lay down your passion:
               A greedy gamester still hath some mis-hap.
               To chafe at play, proceeds of foolish fashion.
               No man throws still the dice in fortunes lap.

               WHen Marcus hath carrowst March Beere and Sack,
               And that his brains grow dizzy therewithall,
               Then of Tobacco he a pipe doth lacke,
               Of Trinidade in cane, in leafe, or ball,
               Which tane a little, he doth spit and smacke,
               Then laies him on his bed for feare to fall,
               And poore Tobacco beares the name of all.
               But that same pipe which Marcus braine did lade.
               Was of Medera, not of Trinidade.
            
            
               
                  35 Tristis es &amp; foelix, sciat hoc fortuna Caueto. To a Lady.

               Beleeue me, Madam, she would make you rue it.
            
            
               
               
                  36 A Salisbury tale.
               FAire Sarum's Church, beside the stately tower,
               Hath many things in number aptly sorted,
               Answering the yeere, the month, weeke, day &amp; houre,
               But aboue all (as I haue heard reported,
               And to the view doth probably appeare)
               A piller for each houre in all the yeere.
               Further, this Church of Sarum hath beene found,
               To keepe in singing seruice so good forme,
               That most Cathedrall Churches haue beene bound,
               Themselues ad vsum Sarum to conforme:
               I am no Cabalist to iudge by number,
               Yet that this Church is so with pillers fill'd,
               It seemes to me to be the lesser wonder,
               That Sarums Church is euery hower pill'd.
               And sith the rest are bound to Sarums vse,

               Were it not mingled with one foule infection?
               I meane, so proud a heart, so curst a tongue,
               As makes her seeme, nor faire, nor rich, nor yong.

               ONe that had farm'd a fat Impropriation,
               Vs'd to his neighbours often exhortation,
               To pay to him the tithes and profits duely,
               Affirming (as he might affirme most truely)
               How that the tithes are God Almighties part,
               And therefore they should pay't with all their heart.
               But straight replyed one amongst the rest,
               (One that had crost him oft, but neuer blest.)
               It is Gods part indeed, whose goodnes gaue it;
               But yet oft times we see the Diuell haue it.

               Doth not beleeue the bodies resurrection,
               But holds them all in scorne and deepe derision,
               That talke of Saints or Angels apparision:
               And saith, they are but fables all, and fansies
               Of Lunaticks, or folkes possest with frensies.

                  ell, Paulus, this I now beleeue indeed,
               That who in all, or part, denyes his Creed;
               Went he to sea, land, hell, I would agree,
               A Fiend worse then himselfe, he could not see.
            
            
               
                  76 Of double Fraud.
               A Fellow false, and to all fraud inured,
               In high Starchamber court was found periured,
               And by iust sentence iudg'd to lose his eares:
               A doome right fit for him that falsly sweares.
               
                  Now on the Pillory while he was preaching,
               The Gaolor busie for his eares was searching:
               But all in vaine, for there was not an eare,
               Onely the places hid with locks of haire.
               Thou knaue, said he, I will of thee complaine
               Vnto the Lords, for cousonage againe.
               Why so, said hee? their order me doth binde
               To lose mine eares, not you mine eares to finde.
            
            
               
                  77 Of taking a Hare.
               VNto a Lawyer rich, a Client poore
               Came early in the morning to his doore,
               And dancing long attendance in the place,
               At last, he gat some counsell in his case;
               For which the Lawyer look't to haue beene paid:
               But thus at last the poore man to him said,
               I cannot giue a fee, my state's so bare:
               But will it please you, Sir, to take a Hare?
               He that tooke all that came, with all his hart,
               Said that he would, and take it in good part.
               Then must you runne apace (good Sir) quoth he:
               For she this morning quite out-stripped me.
               He went his way, the Hare was neuer taken.
               Was not the Lawyer taken, or mistaken?
            
            
               
               
                  78 The Author to his Wife.
               YOur maid Brunetta you with newes acquaints,
               How Leda, (whom, her husband wanting issue,
               Brought erst to Bath, our pilgrimage of Saints)
               Weares her gowne veluet, kirtle, cloth of tissue,
               A figur'd Sattin petticote Carnation,
               With sixe gold parchment laces all in fashion,
               Yet neuer was Dame Leda nobler borne,
               Nor dranke in Gossips cup by Sou'raigne sent,
               Nor euer was her Highnes woman sworne,
               Nor doth her husband much exceed in rent.
               Then Mall, be proud, that thou maist better weare them.
               And I more proud, thou better dost forbeare them.
            
            
               
                  79 Of too high commendation in a meane person.
               A Scholler once, to win his Mistresse loue,
               Compar'd her to three Goddesses aboue,
               And said she had (to giue her due desarts)
               
                  Iuno's, Minerua's, and faire Venus parts.
               
                  Iuno so proud, and curst was of her tongue,
               All men misliked her both old and yong.
               
                  Pallas so soule, and grim was out of measure,
               That neither gods nor men in her tooke pleasure.
               
                  Venus vnchaste, that she strong Mars entices,
               With yong Adonis, and with old Anchises.
               
               How thinke you, are these praises few or meane,
               Compared to a shrow, a slut, or queane?
            
            
               
               
                  80 Of trusting a Captaine.
               AN Alderman, one of the better sort,
               And worthie member of our worthiest Citie;
               Vnto whose Table diuers did resort,
               Himselfe of stomake good, of answeres witty,
               Was once requested by a Table friend,
               To lend an vnknowne Captaine forty pound.
               The which, because he might the rather lend,
               He said he should become in statute bound.
               And this (quoth he) you need not doubt to take,
               For he's a man of late growne in good credit,
               And went about the world with Captaine Drake.
               
               Out (quoth the Alderman) that ere you sed it,
               For forty pounds? no nor for forty pence.
               His single bond I count not worth a chip:
               I say to you (take not hereat offence,)
               He that hath three whole yeeres been in a ship,
               In famine, plagues, in stench, and storme, so rife,
               Cares not to lye in Ludgate all his life.
            
            
               
                  81 In Cornutum.
               WHat curld-pate youth is he that sitteth there
               So neere thy wife, and whispers in her eare,
               And takes her hand in his, and soft doth wring her,
               Sliding his ring still vp and downe her finger?
               Sir, tis a Proctor, seene in both the Lawes,
               Retain'd by her, in some important cause;
               
                  Prompt and discreet both in his speech and action,
               And doth her busines with great satisfaction.
               And thinkest thou so? a horne-plague on thy head:
               Art thou so like a foole, and wittoll led,
               To thinke he doth the businesse of thy wife?
               He doth thy businesse, I dare lay my life.
            
            
               
                  82 A Tragicall Epigram.
               WHen doome of Peeres &amp; Iudges fore-appointed,
               By racking lawes beyond all reach of reason,
               Had vnto death condemn'd a Queene anointed,
               And found, (oh strange!) without allegeance, treason;
               The Axe that should haue done that execution,
               Shunn'd to cut off a head that had beene crowned,
               Our hangman lost his wonted resolution,
               To quell a Queene of noblenesse so renowned.
               Ah, is remorse in hangmen and in steele,
               When Peeres and Iudges no remorse can feele?
               Grant Lord, that in this noble Ile, a Queene
               Without a head, may neuer more be seene.
            
            
               
                  83 Of reading Scriptures.
               THe sacred Scriptures treasure great affoords,
               To all of seuerall tongues, of sundry Realmes.
               For low and simple spirits shallow Foords,
               For high and learned Doctors deeper streames,
               
                  In euery part so exquisitely made,
               An Elephant may swimme, a Lambe may wade.
               Not that all should with barbarous audacity,
               Read what they list, and how they list expound,
               But each one suting to his weake capacity:
               For many great Scriptureans may be found,
               That cite Saint Paul at euery bench and boord,
               And haue Gods word, but haue not God the word.
            
            
               
                  84 The Author to his wife: a rule for praying.
               MY deare, that in your closet for deuotion,
               To kindle in your brest some godly motion,
               You contemplate, and oft your eyes doe fixe
               On some Saints picture, or the Crucifixe;
               Tis not amisse, be it of stone or mettle,
               It serueth in thy mind good thoughts to settle;
               Such images may serue thee as a booke,
               Whereon thou maist with godly reuerence looke,
               And thereby thy remembrance to acquaint,
               With life or death, or vertue of the Saint.
               Yet doe I not allow thou kneele before it,
               Nor would I in no wise you should adore it.
               For as such things well vs'd, are cleane and holy,
               So superstition soone may make it folly.
               All images are scorn'd and quite dis-honoured,
               If the Prototype be not solely honoured.
               I keepe thy picture in a golden shrine,
               And I esteeme it well, because 'tis thine;
               
                  But let me vse thy picture ne're so kindly,
               'Twere little worth, if I vs'd thee vnkindly.
               Sith then, my deare, our heauenly Lord aboue
               Vouchsafeth vnto ours to like his loue:
               So let vs vse his picture, that therein,
               Against himselfe we doe commit no sinne;
               Nor let vs scorne such pictures, nor deride them,
               Like fooles, whose zeale mistaught, cānot abide them.
               But pray, our hearts, by faith's eyes be made able
               To see, what mortall eyes see on a Table.
               A man would thinke, one did deserue a mocke,
               Should say, Oh heauenly Father, to a stocke;
               Such a one were a stocke, I straight should gather,
               That would confesse a stocke to be her Father.
            
            
               
                  85 Poenitentia poenitenda: Of a penitent Fryer.
               BOund by his Church, and Trentin Catechisme,
               To vow a single life, a Cloystered Frier,
               Had got a swelling, call'd a Priapisme,
               Which seld is swag'd, but with a femall fire.
               The Leach (as oftentimes Physicians vse)
               To cure the corps, not caring for the soule,
               Prescribes a cordiall med'cine from the Stewes,
               Which lewd prescript, the Patient did condole:
               Yet strong in Faith, and being loth to dye,
               And knowing that extremes yeeld dispensation,
               He is resolu'd, and doth the med'cine trie:
               Which being done, he made such lamentation,
               
                  That diuers thought he was fall'n in despaire,
               And therefore for his confirmation praid.
               But when that they had ended quite their prayer;
               After long silence, thus to them he said:
               I waile not, that I thinke my fact so vicious;
               Nor am I in despaire: no, neuer doubt it;
               But feeling female flesh is so delicious,
               I waile, to thinke I liu'd so long without it.
            
            
               
                  86 Of a picture with a Ferriman rowing in a tempest, with two Ladies in his boate, whereof he loued one, but she disdained him, and the other loued him, but he not her: now a voice came to his eare, that to saue his boate from beeing cast away, hee must drowne one of the Ladies: in which perplexitie hee speaketh these passions.
               IN troublous seas of loue, my tender bote,
               By Fates decree, is still tost vp and downe,
               Ready to sinke, and may no longer flote,
               Except of these two Damsels one I drowne.
               I would saue both: but ah, that may not be:
               I loue the tone, the tother loueth me.
               Heere the vast waues are ready me to swallow.
               There danger is to strike vpon the shelfe.
               Doubtfull I swim betweene the deepe and shallow,
               To saue th'vngrate, and be vngrate my selfe.
               Thus seeme I by the eares to hold a wolfe,
               While faine I would eschue this gaping gulfe.
               
                  But since loues actions, guided are by passion,
               And quenching doth augment her burning fuell,
               Adieu, thou Nimph, deseruing most compassion,
               To merit mercy, I must shew me cruell.
               Aske you me why? oh question out of season!
               Loue neuer leisure hath to render reason.

               And farre remouing all eye-blinding passion,
               Censure the due desert with iudgement cleere,
               And say, The cruell merit no compassion.
               Liue then, kind Nimph, and ioy we two together:
               Farewell th'vnkind, and all vnkind goe with her.

                  90 Of two that were married and vndone.
               A Fond yong couple, making haste to marry,
               Without their parents will, or friends consent,
               
                  After one month their marriage did repent,
               And su'd vnto the Bishops Ordinary,
               That this their act so vndiscreetly done,
               Might by his more discretion be vndone.
               Vpon which motion he awhile did pause:
               At length, he for their comforts to them said,
               It had beene better (friends) that you had staid:
               But now you are so hampered in the Lawes,
               That I this knot may not vntye (my sonne)
               Yet I will grant you both shall be vndone.
            
            
               
                  91 In commendation of a straw, written at the request of a great Lady, that ware a straw Hat at the Court.
               I Vowd to write of none but matters serious,
               And lawfull vowes to breake, a great offence;
               But yet, faire Ladies hests are so imperious,
               That with all Vowes, all Lawes they can dispence:
               Then yeelding to that all-commanding Law,
               My Muse must tell some honour of a straw.
               Not of Iack Straw, with his rebellious crew,
               That set King, Realme, and Lawes at hab or nab,
               Whom Londons worthy Maior so brauely slew,
               With dudgeon daggers honorable stab,
               That his successors for that seruice loyall,
               Haue yet reward with blow of weapon royall.
               Nor will I praise that fruitlesse straw or stubble,
               Which built vpon most precious stones foundation:
               
                  When fiery tryalls come, the builders trouble,
               Though some great builders build of such a fashion,
               To learned Androes, that much better can,
               I leaue that stubble, fire, and straw to scan.
               Now lift I with Philosophers to range,
               In searching out, (though I admire the reason)
               How simpathising properties most strange,
               Keepe contraries in straw, so long a season.
               Yee, snow, fruits, fish, moist things, &amp; dry &amp; warme,
               Are long preseru'd in straw, with little harme.
               But let all Poets my remembrance wipe,
               From out their bookes of Fame, for euer during,
               If I forget to praise our Oaten pipe,
               Such Musicke, to the Muses all procuring:
               That some learn'd eares preferr'd it haue before
               Both Orpharyon, Violl, Lute, Bandore.
               Now if we lift more curiously examine,
               To search in straw some profitable points,
               Bread hath beene made of straw in time of famine,
               In cutting off the tender knotted ioynts:
               But yet remaines one praise of straw to tell,
               Which all the other praise doth farre excell.
               That straw, which men, &amp; beasts, &amp; fowles haue scorned,
               Hath beene by curious Art, and hand industrious
               So wrought, that it hath shadowed, yea adorned
               A head and face of beauty and birth illustrious.
               Now praise I? No, I enuy now thy blisse,
               Ambitious straw, that so high placed is.
               What Architect this worke so strangely matcht?
               
                  An yuory house, dores, rubies, windowes touch
               A gilded roofe, with straw all ouerthatcht.
               Where shall pearle bide, when place of straw is such?
               Now could I wish, alas, I wish too much,
               I might be straw-drawne to that liuely Tuch.
               But herein we may learne a good example,
               That vertuous Industry their worth can raise,
               Whom slanderous tongs tread vnder foot &amp; trample.
               This told my Muse; and straight she went her waies:
               Which (Lady) if you seriously allow,
               It is no toy, nor haue I broke my vow.
            
            
               
                  92 In Romam.
               HAte, and debate, Rome through the world hath
               Yet Roma Amor is, if backward read.
               Then is't not strange Rome hate should foster? No: spread,
               For out of backward loue, all hate doth grow.
            
            FINIS.
