            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The Prologue.
            
               
                  THe hush'd contentment of two silent howres,
               Breath pleasing ayres on these attentiue eares;
               And since wee see in this well furnish'd roome,
               All our best neighbours are so kindely me
                     •
                  ,
               Wee would deuise some pleasing talke to spend:
               The lazie howres of the tedious night:
               But for our owne inuention, 'twas too weake,
               Whereon our young Muse durst wholly leane.
               We heere present for to reuiue a tale,
               Which once in Athens great Eurypedes
               In better phrase at such a meeting told
               The learn'd Athenians with much applause:
               The same we will retell vnto your eares,
               Whose Atticke iudgement is no lesse then theirs:
               We here as builders which doe oft take stones,
               From out old buildings, then must hew and cut,
               To make them square, and fitting for a new;
               So from an old foundation we haue ta'n,
               Stones ready squar'd for our new aedifice,
               VVhich if in pleasing our weake skill offends
               In making corners disproportionate,
               Some roome too narrow or some loft too high;
               Yet we will hope, if the whole structure fall,
               Your bands like props will serue to beare vp all.

                  That your departure pierc'd my tender soule,

                  Did make a sea, when you should goe to sea,

                  I that last night thought all the world a sea,
                  As if our common mother earth, had now
                  Shot her selfe wholly into Neptunes armes,
                  And the strong hindges of the world had crackt,
                  Letting the moone fall into th' swelling waues,
                  Such watry mountaines oft did seeme to rise,
                  And quite o'rwhelme vs, all the winds at warre,
                  Banded the sea one to the others coasts,
                  
                     Ioue thinking Neptune gan to striue for heauen,
                  Sent a new sea from thence, and with his thunder,
                  Bad silence to the waues, they vncontrold,
                  Kept on their noyse, and let their fury swell,
                  Turning heauen, earth, sea, clouds, and all to hell,
                  Such Troian that was saued then' gan to cry,
                  Happy were they that did with Priam die.
                  It glads mee now to thinke, that that night was
                  No starre, no, not Orion there appear'd,
                  But this night's turnd to day, and heere doth shine,

                     Venus, I see thou art a woman now,
                  Which here are like to take a double foyle,
                  For me, that whilome reueld in thy campe
                  In the sweet pleasures of incestuous sheets
                  Must leaue our lou'd vnsatiate desires:
                  But now begin, thou blacke Eumenides,
                  
                  You hand-mayds of great Dis, let such a flame
                  Of anger burne mee, as doth Etna's forge,
                  On fury, on, our hate shall not die thus:
                  I'll draw my poysonous arrow to the length,
                  That it may hit the marke and fly with-strength.

               Enter Orestes: Pylades:
               
                  Orest.
                  COme now my dearest friend, my other selfe,
                  My empty soule is now fild to the top,
                  Brimfull with gladnesse, and it must runne o'r
                  Into my deare friends heart: those siluer hayres,
                  Which Time hath crown'd my Fathers brow withall,
                  Doe shine within mine eyes, and like the Sunne,
                  Extract all drossie vapors from my soule,
                  Like as the earth, whom frost hath long benumb'd,
                  And brought an Icie drinesse on her face,
                  Her veines so open at a sudden thaw,
                  That all plants, fruits, flowers, and tender grafts,
                  Kept as close prisoners in their mothers wombe,
                  Starts out their heads, and on a sudden doth
                  The sad earths countenance with a summer looke,
                  
                     So in this brest, here in this brest, deare friend▪
                  
                  Whiles Annus ten times circled in the world
                  Ten clumzie winters, and ten lagging springs
                  Hath with my Fathers absence frozen beene
                  All thoughts of ioy, which now shall make a spring
                  In my refreshed soule;
                  " Things that wee daily seeth' affections cloy,
                  " Hopes long desired bring the greatest ioy:
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Nay, but deare Cousin, giue not the reines too much
                  To new receiued ioyes, lest that they runne
                  With so much speed, that they out-Breath themselues;
                  Your Father is come home; but being come
                  Should now some wilfull afterclap of fate
                  (Which Omen Ioue forbid should come to passe)
                  But take him hence againe, and crosse your ioy:
                  Each sparke of gladnesse which you now conceiue,
                  Would turne a flame, for griefe still on extreme
                  Altring his course, turnes to the diuers theame.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Tush Pylades, talke not of what may be,
                  Wee may, indeed i'th' clearest afternoone
                  Expect a storme.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Yes, and such stormes oft come,
                  And wet shrewd too, before we get at home.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  O, but I'll be above all fatall power;
                  I that have such a Father new come home,
                  I that have such a friend, such too rare gifts,
                  Who gave mee these gifts, thought no scowling frowne
                  Of angry fortune e'r should throw mee downe:
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Call them not gifts Orestes, th'are but lent,
                  Meere lendings friend, and lendings we must pay,
                  When e'r the owner shall appoint his day.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  True, Pylades, but owners vse to warne
                  Their debters when they must bring in their summes,
                  But heauens tell mee with fauouring aspects,
                  I still must keepe their lendings, and possesse,
                  With fro like ioy, all their happinesse.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Trust not the heavens too much, although they smile,
                  Good looks doe mortall hearts too oft beguile:
                  The heauens are vsurers; and as oft 'tis seen
                  A full poucht churle giue a most faire good Euen
                  To his poore Creditor: who trusting that
                  
                     Hath slackt his payment: on the morrow next
                  He hath beene rooted out by the tusky boare,
                  Which gaue thee faire good Euen the day before:
                  The heauens can doe thus too —
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Tush: mortalls must
                  Leane on the sacred Heauen with greater trust;
                  But it growes farre in night, come let vs in
                  To morrow shall our ioyes a fresh begin.
Exeunt.
                  
               
            
            
               SCEN. IV.
               Enter Aegist. Clyt. with naked daggers, Agam. lying in his bed.
               
                  EGyst.
                  Night, now onely spred thy sable wings
                  Ouer this climate, gather all thy fogs
                  That they may meet, and make thy face more blacke;
                  Let horrid murder take thee by the hand
                  And come along: I haue a prodigie
                  Equall to all the murders, all the blood
                  That hath been shed in all Troyes ten yeeres seige
He draws the curtaine.
                  
                  So, snore returned King; good Morpheus hang
                  Thy leaden weights vpon his drowsie eyes
                  Let him not wake till he shall see himselfe,
                  Drencht in a sea of his vermilian goare:
                  Thou doest no Troian, now no Hector feare,
                  But yet I'll shew thee a new Hector here.
               
               
                  Clyt.
                  See, I'll turne man too now, and to the hate
                  Which women beare, I'll adde a manly strength,
                  My minde does tremble, what I meane to doe
                  Breath forth your vapors, O ye stygian powers,
                  And listen to hatefull womans prayers.
                  
                     Pluto stand by me, for to aide my hand▪
                  
                  I may strike home now, and performe an act
                  May make Medea blush, she thought not of▪
                  
                  Could the old dry bon'd dotard euer dreame,
                  Now he had drawn forth all his strength abroad,
                  He could be welcome to lye bedred here
                  And supple his numbe ioynts in my fresh armes?
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  Spoke like a queene, spoke like Aegysteus loue,
                  
                     Now great Thyestes Genias, which didst prompt
                  Mee to this act, come, be spectator now,
                  And see reuenge for Athens bloody feast.
                  And thou wrong'd Clytemnestra call to minde
                  How his vnsatiate, lustfull, loath'd desire
                  Doted on euery female face he saw,
                  Rap't the Priests daughter, and so brought a plague
                  On all the Grecian host:
               
               
                  Clytem.
                  yes, yes, Aegysteus, ye
                        •
                     
                  
                  And rap't yong Briseis from Achilles bed;
                  Crowd all reuengefull thoughts into this houre,
                  Now let thy sword let out that lustfull blood
                  Wound him Aegisteus, kill him not at once,
Aegist, stabs him,
                  
                  Wee'll be true Tyrants, let him feele he dies
               
               
                  Agam.
                  Helpe Clytemnestra, helpe me my deare Queene.
               
               
                  Clytem.
                  Yes dotard I will helpe thee, thus, yes thus:
                  Remember the Priests daughter: this for her,
She stabs him.
                  
                  And this for Briseis:
                  
               
               
                  Agam.
                  see, my Grecians, see,
                  Your King which you so gladly entertain'd:
                  
                     Sol hide thy selfe in euerlasting night,
                  Or when thou risest let thy blushing face,
                  Make these to blush;
               
               
                  Clytem.
                  I, so, curse on, curse on:
               
               
                  Agam.
                  O Clytemnestra, O my once deare wife,
                  Is this the entertainment that thou giu'st;
                  Thy new come husband, gratulat'st thou thus
                  My ten yeers absence? see these frosty haires
                  Would euen mooue Hecuba to pittie me,
                  Looke on these aged armes which in this bed
                  Thought to haue beene blessed with thy kinde imbrace,
               
               
                  Clytem.
                  Yes, mine or Cassandra's, old adulterer?
               
               
                  Agam.
                  Kinsman Aegisteus; O my dearest wife
                  Whom shall I call; me thinkes you both are mine,
                  What Titius, what Megaera hath put on
                  
                     Aegysteus and my Clytemnestra's shapes?
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  Calst thou vs friends?
Stabs him againe.
                  
               
               
                  Agam.
                  O be not so, and I'll not call you so:
                  Let not your coward weapons wound this head;
                  That earst did scorne to shrinke at Priams blow.
                  O hew me not downe thus for my sonns sake,
                  Deare Clytemnestra for Orestes sake.
                  Is this the Troian tale how I should tell!
                  
                     That here great Hector slew Antiochus,
                  
                  And here that Meontiades was slaine,
                  And poore Prothesilaus deare to Laodamie:
                  
                  I thought to tell how these men lost their blood;
                  And see my blood is thus let forth at home.
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  Is your hot blood yet cold!
               
               
                  Clyt.
                  breath dotard, do?
                  You shall haue gapes inough to let your soule
                  Finde a free passage to his deserued flames.
               
               
                  Agam.
                  No pitty yet? O then, no pitty light
                  On you, nor yours; but let dire reuenge
                  Come learne how she may after handle you:
                  O, I am drown'd in blood, and now must yeeld
                  To murderers weapons; treason win's the field;
                  Alas this comming home hath had small ioy,
                  
                     Argos hath worser foes then euer Troy.
               
               
                  Clyt.
                  Now I am Clytemnestra right, now I deserue
                  To adde one more to the three Furies, now
                  Doe I count this more then my nuptiall night
                  'Tis mine, tis thine Egystheus, and none else
                  Shall share a minute of this right, but we.
               
               
                  Egyst.
                  Me thinks I now goe equall with the starres
                  And my proud head toucheth the highest pole,
                  Harke, Hell applauds me, and me thinkes I heare
A noyse.
                  
                  
                     Thyestes tell me I haue done enough:
                  And now I kisse my hands, whilst yet they beare
                  This tincture on them, and embrace my Queene,
                  
                  Now made my loue; lets in, this night the Fates
                  Haue amply fed vs with reuengefull cates.
Exeunt,
                  
               
            
            
               SCEN. V.
               Enter Orestes, as from his bed, vnbuttoned in slippers, a torch in his hand.
               WHat horrid dreams affright me? I see naught
               That I should feare, and yet me thinks I feare.
               Mine eyes scarce clos'd, my busie fancy saw
               A sight that dasht all comforts of the day:
               Me thought my Father lying in his tent,
               Hatefull Achilles for his wronged loue
               Comes in with Briseis, and they two let forth
               Streames of fresh blood from out his aged side,
               
                  With that his Eccho'd schrieke did make me wake;
               But I remembred then he was come home,
               And yet I'll see him, still me thinks I quake,
               Doe I still dreame? are not mine eyes vnclos'd?
he drawes the curtaine.
               
               Is this a torch? yes, 'tis, it burnes, I see
               I am awake, doe not delude me night!
               Now stand on tiptoes Atlas, lift heauen higher,
               I may haue ayre inough to breath my woes,
               O let me yet recall thy posting soule
               If Charon haue not hurried thee too fast
               If yet thou hast not drunk on lethes poole,
               Come backe, and tell mee who it is this night,
               Hath don this deed farre blacker then the night?
               Ha! art thou fled past call? why thou wert old
               Me thinkes thou shouldst not haste so fast away:
               Was it for this thou swe'rst so oft in Armes!
               Was it for this that the froth swelling foame
               When thy ships top toucht Heauen, and deepe plac'd hell,
               That thou must yet escape curl'd Neptune's waues
               To be a Palinurus in thy shoare
               There drowne thy aged locks in crimson goare.
               O if one sparke yet of thy Princely Soule
               Remaine within this trunke, now let it shine
               And light my ignorant eyes to reade the names
               Of these night vultures, whose deuouring bills
               Haue made a Titius of thy royall corps:
               Who did not feare great Agamemnons sleepe?
               Arme, arme your selues all you, all potent Gods
               You which we terme Iust ministers of Heauen,
               Shoote forked lightning from the marble poale
               Let the all-seeing eye of heauen shoote flames
               Which may parch vp the marrow from their bones
               Should they lye coucht i'th brest a'th Thunderer,
               Or be entrencht with guards of Furies,
               Heauen, earth, nor hell should keepe them from my sword
               Dost thou sleepe Ioue? O couldst thou snore so fast,
               And let thy great vicegerent thus be torne?
               Some of th'immortall powers haue had fathers,
               And know what'tis to haue them murdered thus.
               But I turne woman now, O I raue out
               
                  My passions; doe griefe, poure out thy selfe,
               That thou mayst make roome in my empty heart
               To fill it with reuenge.

                  What bloody Troian followed thee from thence
                  To kill thee here, could he not one night
                  Haue let me rested in thy sweet embraces?
                  Must he for surenesse make so many holes

                  Now thou'ldst be glad to haue lost so many sons,

                  Let vs ioyne words then now, and Swan-like sing,
                  The dolefull dirge to a departed King:
                  Thou friend didst of this misery diuine,
                  Therefore the burthen of the song is mine:
                  Words Orators for woe, which plead the cause,
                  When griefe's the Iudge, and sighs are all the lawes,
                  Each one a sob, for Diapason beares,
                  Our tunes shall drowne the musique of the spheares:
                  O what Hirudo with vnsatiate thirst,
                  Could draw the blood from out those Princely veynes,
                  From whence flowes comfort to so many soules.

                  Hath griefe conceiu'd for her late husbands death,

                  Great Agamemnon: whose diuiner soule
                  Fled from thy corps, exil'd by buchers hands,
                  His friend still sought to keepe his dying life
                  With words of comfort, that it should not rush
                  Too violently vpon the hands of Fate.
                  He deafe as sea, to which he made his plaints,
                  Still cryed out, Agamemnon, I will come,
                  And finde thy blessed soule where e'r it walke,
                  In what faire Tempe of Elisium
                  
                  So e'r it be, my soule shall find it out;

                  And gathered all his waters to one place,

                  Great mindes must not esteeme what small tongues say.
                  All things in state must euer haue this end,
                  The vulgar should both suffer, and commend,
                  If not for loue, for feare; great maiesty
                  Should doe those things the vulgar dare not see.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  O, Sir, but those that doe commend for feare,
                  Doe in their hearts a secret hatred beare.
                  Euer learne this; the truest praise indeed,
                  Must from the heart, and not from words proceed.
                  I feare some foule play: doth Aegystheus meane,
                  Then totally for to inuest himselfe
                  In Agamemnons seat? Where's young Orestes?
               
               
                  Mis.
                  Why my Lord? hee for the great griefe conceiu'd,
                  Being young, not knowing well to rule himselfe
                  With sway of reason, ranne vpon his death,
                  And threw himselfe with my Lord Strophius sonne,
                  Into the midst of Alpheus, so was drown'd.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  How took my daughter that?
               
               
                  Mis.
                  Why, wisely too,
                  And like her selfe; not being in despaire:
                  
                     Her royall wombe will bring forth many more,
                  Shall be as deare as e'r Orestes was.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  I feare heauen cannot looke with equall eyes
                  Vpon so many deaths, but meanes to send
                  Plague after plague; for in a wretched state,
                  One ill begets another dismall Fate:
                  But goe and tell my daughter I will come,
                  And helpe to solemnize her nuptiall night:
                  Her hasty wedding, and the old Kings neglect,
                  Makes my coniecturall soule some ill suspect.
Exeunt.
                  
               
            
            
               SCEN. II.
               Enter Orestes, and Pylades.
               
                  Orest.
                  IF euer God lent any thing to earth,
                  Whereby it seem'd to symphatize with heauen,
                  It is this sacred friendship: Gordian knot
                  Which Kings, nor Gods, nor Fortune can vndoe.
                  O what Horoscopus, what constellation,
                  Held in our birth so great an influence,
                  Which one affection in two mindes vnites?
                  How hath my wo beene thine, my fatall ill
                  Hath still beene parted, and one share beene thine!
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Why, dearest friend, suppose my case were thine,
                  And I had lost a father, wouldst not thou
                  In the like sort participate my griefe?
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Yes, witnesse heauen I would.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  So, now thou hast lost a father,
               
               
                  Orest.
                  True, Pylades, thou putst me well in mind,
                  I haue lost a father, a deare, deare father,
                  A King, a braue old King, a noble souldier,
                  And yet he was murdered: O my forgetfull soule;
                  Why should not I now drawe my vengefull sword,
                  And strait-way sheath it in the murderers heart?
                  
                     Minos should neuer haue vacation,
                  Whilst any of our progeny remain'd.
                  Well, I will goe, and so massacre him,
                  I'll teach him how to murder an old man,
                  A King, my Father, and so dastardly
                  To kill him in his bed.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Alas, Orestes!
                  
                     Griefe doth distract thee▪ who ist thou wilt kill?
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Why, he, or she, or they that kill'd my father.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  I, who are they?
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Nay, I know not yet,
                  But I will know.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Stay thy vengefull thoughts,
                  And since thus long we haue estrang'd our selues
                  From friends and parents, lets thinke why it is,
                  And why we had it noysed in the Court,
                  We both were dead; the cause was thy reuenge,
                  That if by any secret priuate meanes,
                  We might but learne who'twas, that drench'd their swords
                  In thy deare fathers blood, wee then would rouze
                  Blacke Nemesis in flames from out her caue,
                  And shee should be the vmpire in this cause.
                  Mans soule is like a boystrous working sea,
                  Swelling in billowes for disdaine of wrongs,
                  And tumbling vp and downe from day to day,
                  Growes greater still in indignation,
                  Turnes male content, in pleaselesse melancholly,
                  Spending her humours in dull passion, still
                  Locking her senses in vnclosed gins,
                  Till by reuenge shee sets at liberty.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  O, now my thirsty soule expects full draughts
                  Of Ate's boyling cup: O, how two'ld ease
                  My heart, to see a channell of his blood,
                  Streaming from hence to hell, that killd my father,
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  I, but deare friend, thou must not let rage loose,
                  And like a furious Lyon, from whose denne
                  The forrester hath stolne away his young,
                  Hee missing it, strait runnes with open iawes
                  On all he meets, and neuer hurting him
                  That did the wrong; wise men must mix reuenge
                  With reason, which by prouidence will prompt,
                  And tell vs where's the marke, whereat we ayme.
                  Till then in Cinders wee'll rake vp our griefe,
                  Fire thus kept, still liues, but opened dies,
                  From smallest sparks great flames may one day rise.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  True, friend, but, O, who euer will reueale
                  This hideous act! what power shall wee inuoke?
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Yes, harken friend, I haue bethought a meanes;
                  Not distant farre from this place where we liue,
                  
                     There stands a caue hard by a hollow oake,
                  In a low valley where no Sun appeares,
                  No musique euer was there heard to sound;
                  But the harsh voyce of croking ominous rauens.
                  And sad Nyctimine the bird of night,
                  There's now a shed vnder whose ancient roofe,
                  There sometimes stood an Altar for the Gods,
                  But now slow creeping time, with windy blasts
                  Hath beaten downe that stately Temples walls,
                  Defac't his rich built windows, and vntil'd
                  His battlemented roofe, and made it now
                  A habitation, nor for God, nor men:
                  Yet an old woman, who doth seem to striue
                  With the vast building for antiquity,
                  In whose rough face time now hath made such holes,
                  As in those vncouth stones she there hath made
                  Her selfe a cell, wherein to spend her age;
                  Her name's Canidia; great in Magique spells,
                  At whose dire voyce, the gods themselues would quake,
                  To heare her charme the second time pronounc't.
                  One that can know the secrets of Heauen,
                  And in the ayre hath flying ministers,
                  To bring her news from earth, from sea, from hell:
                  Which, when thick night hath compas't in the world,
                  Then doth she goe to dead mens graues and tombs,
                  And sucks the poysonous marrow from their bones,
                  Then makes her charme, which she nere spent in vaine,
                  Nor doth she comes as suppliant to the Gods,
                  But making Erebus, and Heauen to quake,
                  She sends a spell drowning infernall thunder,
                  By which all secrets that were euer don,
                  In faire white parchment writ in lines of blood,
                  Lockt in the inmost roome of hell it selfe
                  Is brought vnto her: and by her we may
                  Haue leaue to looke in Pluto's register,
                  And read the names of those most loathed Furies,
                  Which rent thy Fathers soule from out his truncke,
                  But she must see thy Fathers dead bones first,
                  Them we must bring her, for by them she works:
                  This if thou dar'st assay, I'll goe along.
               
               
                  
                  Orest.
                  If I dare assay? yes, yes, deare friend,
                  Were it to burst my Fathers sepulchre,
                  And wake his Manes, shew them Radamanth,
                  
                  Their iterated sight will burne my soule
                  With such a sparkling flame of dire reuenge,
                  As Nessus shirt did burn great Hercules,
                  
                  If that the scrowle which did containe their names,
                  Were in a lake of flaming brimstone drencht,
                  I'd take it out, or fetch't from Pluto's armes:
                  But come; I fea
                        •
                     th haue such a creature as can tell,
                  Twill saue a iourney for this once from hell.
               
            
            
               SCEN. III.
               Enter Aegyst. Clytem. Tynd. Msiander Strophius, Electra, cum caet. with a crown. Aegyst ascends the throne, Miander crownes him: Clytem▪great with child.
               
                  Mys.
                  ALL yeares of happy dayes, all houres of Ioy
                  So circle in thy state, as doth this crown
                  Wreath and combine thy princely temples in,
                  
                     All speak! Ioue still protect Aegystheus.
                  
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  Thanks to my Fathers subiects:
                  Now Argos swell vp to the brim with ioy,
                  And streams of gladnes flow on Tyndarus,
                  
                  Now made our Father; see old King, see here's
                  My Queene doth meane to make thee a grandfather,
                  See how thy royall blood shall propagate,
                  Whose Kingly drops like heauen distilling dew
                  Shall adde fresh life vnto thy withered roote.
               
               
                  Tyn.
                  Yes, but Aegystheus, there were armes before
                  Grew on this tree; but the Fates enuious axe
                  Hath cut them off before th'ad time to sproute:
               
               
                  Clyt.
                  O Sir, the Fates needs must haue leaue to make
                  Wayes for themselues to mannage what they doe:
                  Had Agamemnon and Orestes liu'd,
                  They could not then haue blest me with these gifts:
                  Still when the heauens and Fates doe worke their will,
                  They intend good, though sometimes there come ill.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  O but pray Ioue the Fates now were not forc't,
                  But deeds like words no man can e're recall,
                  Bee't good or ill; once don, we must beare all.

They set to the feast.

                  O let my latter age not liue to see

                  Elect.
                  Feare not good vncle, there wil be a time
                  To pull him downe, although he yet doth climbe:
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  Who euer trusted much on fortunes gifts,
                  On wife, on state, on health, on friends, on lands,
                  May looke on Agamemnons comming home:
                  Fortune me thinks ne're shew'd her power more,
                  How quickly could she turn her Fatall sword
                  Vpon his brest, that thought himselfe past harme,
                  She that had vs'd death like an angry dogge,
                  Holding him vp, when that he should haue bit,
                  When al the game was past, and's fury laid,
                  The King being past all danger, safe at home,
                  Then he slip's coller, neuer vntill then;
                  And fortune she stood hissing of him on,
                  Till he had torne the good Kings soule away.

                  Nay but good Father let passe elegies,
Clyt. seems to weep
                  
                  You draw fresh tears now from your daughters eies,
                  Who shed enough before at's funerall,
                  Let's talke who are to liue, not who are dead;
                  And thinke what progeny shall spring from vs
                  May beare your Image stampt vpon the face,
                  This we must talke of now, not what griefs past
                  But of the ioy to come:

                  My Queen not well?
                  Now good Electra looke vnto your mother,
Clyt. riseth from the table.

                  Why, will not now a young Aegystheus be,
                  As gratefull as an old Orestes was?
                  Thou times good lengthener, age, posterity,
                  Spread thy selfe still vpon Aegistheus line,
                  Helpe me to treasure vp antiquity,
                  And from Thyestes loyns let spring an heire,
                  Shall euer sit in great Thyestes chaire.
Exeunt.
                  
               
            
            
               
               SCEN. IV.
               Enter Pylades &amp; Orestes, with his arme full of a dead mans bones and a Scull.
               
                  Pylad.
                  Neare to this shady groue, where neuer light
                  Appeares, but when `tis forced with som charm,
                  
                     Canidia dwells, in such a dusky place,
                  That the night goblins feare to come too neare it,
                  Here let vs knocke.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Nay, Pylady, see here,
                  O giue me leaue to descant on these bones:
                  This was my Fathers scull; but who can know
                  Whether it were some subiects scull, or no:
                  Where be these Princely eyes, commanding face,
                  The braue Maiesticke looke, the Kingly grace,
                  Wher's the imperious frowne, the Godlike smile,
                  The gracefull tongue, that spoke a souldiers stile?
                  Ha, ha, worms eate them: could no princely looke,
                  No line of eloquence writ in this booke,
                  Command, nor yet perswade the worms away!
                  Rebellious worms! could a King beare no sway?
                  Iniurious worms! what could no flesh serue,
                  But Kings for you? By heauen you all shall sterue:
                  Had I but known't; what must my father make
                  A feast for you? O ye deuouring creatures!
               
               
                  Pyla.
                  Now some Archilocus to helpe him make
                  Vengefull Iambiques, that would make these worms
                  To burst themselues; Passion must please
                  It selfe by words, griefe told it selfe doth ease.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  You cowardly bones, would you be thus vncloth'd
                  By little crawling wormes! by Ioue I neuer thought
                  My Fathers bones could e're haue beene such cowards:
                  O you vngratefull wormes how haue you vs'd him;
                  See their ingratitude: O ambitious creatures,
                  How they still domineere, or`e a Kings carcasse,
               
               
                  Pyla.
                  How could they thinke Orestes, when thou cam'st to the crown
                  That thou shouldst beare, that these should eate thy father,
               
               
                  Orest.
                  True? Pylades, should not I rend their maws,
                  Deuise some new tortures? O most horrible treason,
                  That worms should come vnto a great Kings face,
                  
                     And eate his eyes: why, I would vndertake
                  But at one stampe to kill a thousand of 'em,
                  And I will kill these:
Stamps upon them.
                  
                  Goe you Kings-eating creatures: I will marre
                  All your digestion.
               
               
                  Pylad.
                  Alas, where be his wits?
                  He stands declaming against senselesse worms,
                  And turnes more senslesse then the worms themselues;
                  Wher's now the oracle you should consult,
                  The great Magician, now the Centaurs thought
                  Shall be example to all future yeers,
                  And now transcend Proserpina's inuention,
                  Ha, hast thou found them out, ha, were they worms?
               
               
                  Orest..
                  O prethe laugh not at me me, call her, call her;
Pyl. knocks.
                  
                  Whilst I stand gathering vp my Fathers bones,
                  His deare disiected bones; O, I remember, here
                  Ran the strong sinews, twixt his knitting ioynts,
                  Here to this bone was ioyn'd his Princely arme,
                  Here stood the hand that bare this warlike shield,
                  And on this little ioynt was place't the head,
                  That Atlas-like bare vp the weight of Greece,
                  Here, here betwixt these hollow yawning iaws
                  Stood once a tongue, which with one little word
                  Could haue commanded thousand souls to death:
                  Good hands indure this your weighty taske,
                  And good eyes striue not to make moyst his bones
                  With weeping teares:
                  What sin's our Procustes euer could
                  Haue hackt a King into such things as these;
                  Alas her's euery part now so deform'd,
                  I know not which was his, yet all was his.
               
               Sound infernall Musique.
            
            
               SCEN. V.
               Enter Canidia, like an Enchauntresse.
               
                  Orest.

                  His humane function, at this hellish sight.

                  Who is't disturbs our caue, what messenger

                  Prompt vs some Ghost,
                  Great feare of earth, and gouernesse of nature,
                  In whose deepe closet of that sacred heart
                  Are written the characters of future Fate;
                  And what is done, or what must be thou knowst:
                  Whose words make burning Acheron grow cold,
                  And Ioue leaue thundring, when he heares thy name,
                  To thee we come: O turne thy secret booke,
                  And looke whose names thou there shalt see inscrib'd
                  For murderers, reade or'e all the catalogue,

                  Which kild the King of Greece, great Agamemnon.
                  
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Yes, he that did owe these bones which worms haue eate;
                  It is not now one of the meaner sort
                  That craues this boone, but 'tis the heire of Greece,
                  Heire onely now but to my Fathers graue;
                  I not command, but my astonisht soule
                  Entreats to know.
                  If in thy booke it be not yet put downe,
                  Command the Gods to vnlocke the gates of Heauen;
                  And fetch forth death, command him to relate
                  Who 'twas put Agamemnon in his hands,
                  This is our businesse, this, great prophetesse,
                  Made vs approach to thy most hallowed cell.

                  Ho, ho, ho, I tell thee fond young Prince!
                  A lesser power thou mightst haue implor'd,
                  Which might haue vrg'd th'vnwilling fiends to this:
                  Our dire enchantments carry such a force,
                  That when the stars, and influence of heauen,
                  Haue suckt the liuely bloud from out mens veyns,

                  I knew each houre in the Troian fight,
                  What Grecian, or what Phrygian should die,
                  And fierce Achilles had no sooner pierc't
                  Great Hectors side, but fate did send me word:
                  Earth, Sea, deepe Chaos, all the stony hills,
                  Will ope themselues to shew me prodigies;
                  Night will vnmaske her brow, to let me see
                  What blacke conceptions teeme within her wombe.

                  Shew to my rites thy greatest power.
                  
                     Erictho when my torch shall twinkle,
                  Auernall water thou shalt sprinckle
                  About the roome, now let vs kneele,
                  Our heauy burthen Hell shall feele:
                  Lets all coyn words, now we may see
                  Who 'twas did worke this prodigie.
               
               
                  Omnes.
                  
                     Pluto, great Pluto, we command,
                  Thou send vnto vs out of hand,
                  The shapes of those that kild the King,
                  Great Agamemnon.
                  
               
               Infernall Musique.
               Enter in a dumbe shew Aegystheus, and Clytem. with their bloody daggers, looke vpon the bed, goe to it, and stab, and then make a shew of gladnes and depart.
               
                  Or.
                  O 'tis aboue my bearing, were I linkt here with chains,
                  
                     I would like Cerberus draw Alcides backe:
                  Stay, stay, by heauens, reuenge shall 
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
                  Nay, I will follow you, should they take 
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
                  Where Aetna vomits fire, I would in:
                  My mother, Clytemnestra, Aegystheus, was it they?
                  Nay, I will o'rtake them.
               
               
                  Can.
                  O sonne, remember what I told you sonne,
                  Many a rockie hill and stony mount,
                  Many a sea, and vast Charybdis gulfe,
                  Stands betwixt them and thee, though they seeme neere.
               
               
                  Ore.
                  O piety! O most prodigious nature!
                  What creatures hast thou made to liue on earth?
                  How hast thou cloath'd blacke darknesse with a scarfe
                  Of vnstain'd purity, and put a godly face
                  Vpon portentuous diuells? Oh, how my mother wept!
                  How Clitemnestra! how that Hiena wept!
                  No more my mother, I abiure the name,
                  She did not bring me forth, I know she did not:
                  But I'll o'rtake 'em; shew mee Canidia where,
                  Which way they went, where haue they hid themselues.
                  Should they mount vp to the chariot of the Sunne,
                  And in his Carre fly to the Antipodes,
                  
                  Or in the farthest nooke of yonder spheare:
                  Get vp and place themselues betwixt Taurus hornes,
                  The fire-breathing bull, nor Lerna's Hydra,
                  
                  Were there no entrance but ten Lyons iawes,
                  I'd runne through all, and make my way my selfe:
                  I'd fix them to the Axell tree of heauen,
                  Where their infectious Carcasses shauld hang,
                  Abait for flying spirits in the Ayre.
                  
                     Canidia, I thanke thee for thy paines;
                  Still may thy sacred Act reueale such deeds,
                  Still keepe the gates of Orcus yawning ope,
                  Make the darke powers ready at command.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  But let vs haste deare friend, this vast worlds roome▪
                  
                  Allowes vs none, but thy dead fathers Tombe:
                  Here's naught but ayres of death, no bed but stones
                  Our pillow's a dead scull, companions bones,
                  Thi's all our comfort, if wee needs must die,
                  We haue a graue prepar'd wherein to lie.
               
               
                  
                  Orest.
                  Now pale Tisiphone, O for thy Snakes!
                  O that renonw'ned spirit, that more then man,
                  Whom all the Troian host could not o'rwhelme,
                  Murdred; but what braue warrier wore a crown,
                  By guilding a dire sword in his deare blood?
                  
                     Hector, nor Priam, no, nor Mars himselfe,
                  Onely his wife was his Bellona now.
                  O miserable valour, to scape foes,
                  And come for to be murdred of his friends:
                  O shamefull conquest! O most coward Fate,
                  That a weake woman was competitor
                  In Agamemnons death: had it beene any, yet
                  It should haue beene a Goddesse at the least,
                  And yet snee's but a Queene, a mortall woman.
                  Were she a Goddesse, I would make he mortall;
                  Dull coward that I am, and, worse then all,
                  After so many wrongs, yet vnreueng'd,
                  Their Palace now should fire o'r their heads,
                  And the huge beams dash out their guilty brains:
                  The roofe, should fall on me, so't fell on them.
                  Begin reuenge, and now performe an act,
                  May giue a theame to all posterity,
                  Euer to talke of, fraught so full of horrour,
                  
                     Aegystheus and my mother, may with their's,
                  Yet none was euer greater, yes, my deed.
                  Reuenge is lost, vnlesse we doe exceed.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  But a bad mother, friend, thou shouldst not hurt,
                  The law of nature doth forbid such thoughts.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Nor Gods, nor nature shall keepe mee inawe,
                  Why towards my mother, by heauens Parliament,
                  Who is most guilty, is most innocent.
               
               
                  Can.
                  Shall I thus by some magique Art, my sonne,
                  Take both their pictures in pure virgin waxe?
                  And wound the place where that the hurt should stand,
                  And so wound them?
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Tush, this is too little.
               
               
                  Can.
                  Shall I breed them hate?
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Too little too.
               
               
                  Can.
                  Shall I consume their children?
               
               
                  Ore.
                  All this too little.
                  Hell and the furies shall stand all amaz'd,

                        cto shall come there for to behold
                  New kinds of murthers which she knew not yet:
                  
                     And nature learne to violate her selfe,
                  I'll instantly to th'Court, and what I doe,
                  My selfe will see done, yes, and act it too.
                  Thanks great Canidia, this blacke night being done,
                  Reuenge now knowes her game whereat to runne.

            ACT. IIII.
            
               SCEN. I.
               Enter in state, Aegystheus: Clytemnestra: Tyndarus: Strophius: Electra: Nutrix: cum nouo partu:
               
                  Aegyst.
                  NEuer but when a royall off-spring comes
                  From a Kings loynes, can hee be truly King,
                  Then doth he sit firme, rooted in his state,
                  Then is he truly man, and then the Gods
                  He knowes doe loue him, which when Kings doe want,
                  The curse of nature doth deny them fruit,
                  And brands their bed with loath'd sterility.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  
                     Aegystheus, since the Gods haue bless'd you so,
                  Haue care their blessings turne not to your woe.
                  Your ioy, my daughters ioy, and my ioy too,
                  Haue care it be preseru'd, and brought vp well:
                  And take heed, sonne, of Agamemnons blood,
                  Pierce not with enuy the Babes tender heart.
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  Tush father, now not without griefe I speake
                  All brookes which from the Princely Ocean ranne,
                  Are quite dry'd vp, onely Electra here,
                  Our deare Electra, whose great weight of loue
                  Is in our ballance equally so poys'd,
                  That shee shall euer thinke her father liues,
                  Our heart shall be so parallell with hers.
               
               
                  El.
                  Yes, great Aegystheus, wer't but our mothers will,
                  What she thinkes good of, I must not thinke ill:
                  Besides, your loue e'r since my fathers death,
                  As 
                        〈…〉
                     ame from his departing soule,
                  And 
                        〈◊〉
                      with had reuiu'd againe in you,

                      prospectiu for me, to see
                  
                     
                        〈…〉
                     oubled, though the obiect's chang'd,
                  
                     
                        〈…〉
                      a brother, if you please,
                  
                     That I may challenge in your royall blood,
                  Here doe I tie with all affections bands,
                  My selfe vnto this Babe, which is as deare
                  Vnto my soule, as were Orestes here.
               
               
                  Clyt.
                  Daughter, your heart now with obedience strung,
                  Makes a sweet musique sounding from your tongue.
                  Nurse, bring the Babe, giue it Electra, so,
                  You daughter shall haue ouersight of it.
               
               
                  Nutr.
                  O, shall I part from't then?
               
               
                  Clyt.
                  No, good Nurse, no,
                  
                     Electra with her care, you with your paines.
               
               
                  Nutr.
                  Now by Lucina, had it gone away,
                  I should haue sit, and sob'd away my heart;
                  'Tis the sweetest Babe that euer Nurse did kisse.
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  Looke here good father, looke my nobles here,
                  Vpon this Babe scarce crept yet out of earth,
                  For you shall grow an Autumn of ripe yeeres,
                  When time hath brought it to maturity,
                  Looke on thy Grandchilde, Tyndarus, see, 'tis thine,
                  This came from thee, old man, see how it smiles
                  Vpon the Grandsire, as if wise nature had
                  Taught him his kindreds names fore he came forth.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  I see't Aegystheus, and my ag'd blood grows warme,
                  As if my selfe were a new father made,
                  And all the blessings I can render it,
                  Shal drop like golden showers on the head:
                  Me thinks it doth recall my sliding age,
                  And makes swift time retire backe againe:
                  It doth vnfold those wrincles in my face,
                  Which griefe and yeeres had fixed as their signes
                  Vpon my brow, and now it shall be seene,
                  Althoug my hayres are gray, my ioyes are greene.
               
               
                  Clyt.
                  Long may our father his opinion hold,
                  And you, our daughter, let not sinister thoughts
                  Wrong your suspicious minde, though this being young,
                  It makes our Lord, and me to speake our ioyes,
                  Yet our affection and our naturall loue,
                  Is not a whit to you diminished.
                  A mother can be mother vnto many,
                  And as from one roote hid within the ground,
                  Springs many flowers, that lends sap to all:
                  
                     So from a parents heart runne veines of loue;
                  Which, though to many, they without doe flow,
                  Yet from one heart, one root, they all doe grow.
               
               
                  Elect.
                  I hope our gracious mother cannot thinke
                  We doe suspect her loue, witnesse this charge,
                  Which you haue bless'd my armes and soule withall,
                  And as your loue committed it with care,
                  My care shall still defend it with my loue.
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  We thanke our daughter, come Lord Strophius, come,
                  Griefe still sits heauy on your sighing heart,
                  Be frolike, learne of vs, in all the grace,

                  I thanke my gracious Lord, time hath by this▪
                  
                  Almost eate out the memory of our sonne,
                  And since the heauens let fall their dew on you,
                  And watred Argos with such springing hopes,
                  I will not seeme a stocke, vncapable
                  Of such a generall comfort, but reuiue
                  My buried thoughts, and for my Souerignes sake,
                  Old Strophius will a young mans person take.
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  We thanke old Strophius, and if honour can
                  Keepe thee still young, our Princely hand is wide,
                  And freely shall extend all graces on thee,
                  And you all our subiects, which beare part
                  Thus in our ioy; and here I doe proclaime,
                  And personally from my owne mouth pronounce,
                  Sealing it with the signet of my State,
                  A generall immunity to all
                  Murders, rapes, treasons, thefts, conueyances,
                  Which haue beene from the birth of our deare childe,
                  In all the confines of our Empire done;
                  Nor shall your licence date be quite expired,
                  Till the slow yeere seuen times runnes out his course.
                  Our selfe thus speake it; vntill then all's free,
                  Kings win their subiects by immunity.
Exeunt omnes.

                  I'll onely with my Vncle change a word.
                  Nurse sings.
                  
                     Lullaby, lullaby Baby,
                     Great Argos ioy,
                     The King of Greece thou art borne to be,
                     In despight of Troy.

                     Of Deities.
                     O, how this brow will beseeme a crowne!
                     How these lockes will shine!
                     Like the raies of the Sun on the ground,
                     These lockes of thine.

                     On these rubie lips
                     May thy minde like a Lambe be meeke,

                  You neuer heard from my brother, Vncle,

                  In troth, Electra, I am in despaire,
                  Almost of euer seeing them againe;
                  Sure if Orestes liue, and euer heare,
                  Vnto what passe Aegystheus brings his state,
                  Seated him in the throne of his mothers bed,
                  And like to leaue Argos hereditary
                  To his posterity, it cannot e'r be borne,
                  
                     Orestes spirit will endure no scorne.
               
               
                  Elect.
                  Vncle, his long delayes make mee surmise,
                  Or he will neuer come, or come with prize;
                  Hee, if now come, hee must not shew himselfe,
                  But liue vnknowne, vnnam'd, or change his name.

                     Which I doe feare me hee will hardly doe.
                  But if we hear not from them now e're long,
                  I'll listen by some meanes about the land,
                  To heare of them; meane time you to your charge,
                  Officious duty must our liues enlarge.

               SCEN. II.
               Enter Orestes, and Pylades.
               
                  Orest.
                  O, here's the Palace vnder whose kinde roofe
                  My tender yeeres were gently fostered:
                  But now the sight on't seemes to strike my soule,
                  When I but thinke it holds within the walls,
                  The patrons of such lust incarnate diuells,
                  Mere Pythonists, that fascinate the world.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Nay, but Orestes, thinke now of your selfe,
                  Complaine not of your wrongs, but seeke to right them.
                  We might haue liu'd i'th woods still to complaine,
                  And to that purpose wee may turne againe.
                  Whet vp your former thoughts, and spend not time,
                  To raue, but to reuenge this odious act.
                  We know they were their shapes, and no Chymera's.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  O, Pylades, knew I thou art my friend?
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  I hope you thinke it.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  I doe, I dare sweare it,
                  So I dare sweare it was Aegystheus, and
                  The dumbe witch, the O, what things enough
                  To be an attribute to terme her by.
                  The Clytemnestra, O, wee saw her do't.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  'Twas a blacke deede indeede, and past all thought.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  O, hell it selfe has not the patterne to't:
                  Some stench, some fogs, vapours stop their breath,
                  Exhald from out the dampish wombe of Styx,
                  Did euer foule, disastrous, friendlike hands,
                  Cast vp so huge a heape of hell-bred mischiefe.
                  Were I to diue to'th depth of Phlageton,
                  
                  Or fetch young Ganimed from the armes of Ioue,
                  
                  To rend Proserpina from Pluto's bed,
                  Or take the vulture from off Titius heart,
                  And set it on my mothers, I'd do't;
                  
                     I'll breake ope doores, and nayle'em to their bed;
                  Harka, reuenge calls mee, I, I come, I come,
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Nay, still outragious friend, good now containe
                  Your heady fury in wisedomes reyne:
                  Harken to my aduice.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  I will, deare friend,
                  Thou hast plaid musique to my dolefull soule;
                  And when my heatt was tympaniz'd with griefe,
                  Thou lauedst out some into thy heart from mine,
                  And kepst it so from bursting; thou hast tide
                  With thy kinde counsell, as these loosned strings,
                  They should not cracke asunder with their weight.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Then listen now, the best plot I can thinke,
                  Is this: wee here will liue a while vnknowne:
                  
                     Orestes, thy profession shall be physicke,
                  I as your friend t'company you at Court;
                  Carry it neatly, learne a few strange words,
                  Palliate your woe a while, and coope vp griefe,
                  You may in time so minister to the King,
                  Physiques occasion fit reuenge may bring.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Rarely inuented, I'll speake Amphorismes,
                  Sublim'd purgations, Quintessence distill'd.
                  Each dose I giue shall make a heart to bleed,
                  And proue a true Physician so indeed.
               
               Enter Misander, hauing o'r-heard their talke.
               
                  Mis.
                  'Twas my good Genius guided me here now,
                  To heare conspiracie; wherefore I'll attach them.
                  Saue you Gentlemen.
               
               
                  Ore.
                  Saue you too, if you please.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Sir, 'twas small manners to interrupt our talke,
                  And giue no warning of your being neere.
               
               
                  Mis.
                  Warning? you shall haue warning, yes, I know
                  I heard you both, and vnderstood your plot,
                  You'll turne Physician, Sir, and giue rare glisters,
                  Shall worke like Stibium, to purge out hearts,
                  You thought to act well true Physicians parts.
               
               
                  Ore.
                  Therefore on thee our medicine first shall worke.
               
               
                  Mis.
                  Help, murder.
               
               
                  Ore.
                  Nay Parasite I'll gag you,
Stabs him.
                  
                  You shall not fawne againe, or wag your tayle,
                  When the King nods.
               
               
                  Mis.
                  O help me, I am slaine.
                  Stop his breath quickly, if but he be dead,
                  
                     We may escape the danger of the treason,
                  Nay he is silent; O but we are beset.
               
            
            
               SCEN. III.
               Enter a Lord and others at the out-cry.
               
                  Lor.
                  LOoke out, me thought I heard one cry out murder,
                  Some voyce I am sure did disturbe the court,
                  It was Misanders voyce me thought that cried,
Spies him dead.
                  
                  And see hee's slaine; one whom the Kings esteeme
                  Did ranke among the best; there are the murderers,
                  Fellowes, how durst you thus abuse the court?
                  Goe, haste to'th' Kings tell him the men be here.
               
               
                  Pylad.
                  Gentlemen, we as louers to the court,
                  Came here as strangers, for to see the King,
                  This man being comming out, too soone for vs;

                  So thinking much to be strooke againe,
                  He grew so hot, he drw and made a Stab;
                  At which encounter both inclosing him
                  'Twixt vs, he tooke a wound worse then we thought
                  To giue, for we did thinke to haue giuen none;
                  But since 'tis thus, we must appeale to th' King.

                  Committed in the date of such a time,

                     Hearing acute Philosophers dispute
                  'twixt life and death, and of a future state

                  But this is so transcendant, and so great,
                  It must not be slipt without impunity,
                  To doe a haynous murder, and i'th court,

                  The greatest crime that Nature doth abhorre,
                  Not being, is abominable to her,

                  My gracious soueraigns, this strange spectacle
                  Renues the memory of my once great losse,
                  And my deare Queens, we once were blest with two,
                  Which so had link'd themselues in bands of Loue,
                  As these men now doe seeme to me they haue.
                  One streame of loue did in two hearts so glide,
                  One with the other liu'd, with other dide.
                  And would my Queene be my competitor,
                  For our sons sake my suits should ioyne with her,
                  Since Iustice craues but one, and both will goe,
                  Euen saue them both, and right wrong iustice so.
               
               
                  Clytem.
                  I, good my loue, let iustice come and looke,
                  If she can finde in all her statute booke,
                  Two men for the same crime should rightly die;
                  She will not say so, iustice cannot lie.
                  And since they both will die, let ones loue saue
                  The others life, and so both life shall haue.

                     Well, since your loues are both so strongly tide,
                  And friendship like an old acquaintance sends
                  To her friend, Iustice, that she should be milde,
                  And looks with eyes of mercy, on your fault,
                  Considering our immunity proclaim'd,
                  And such petitioners as you both haue got,
                  Death in our sentence now shall haue no part,
                  Whilst who should haue done worst confession striues,
                  Too much confession thus saues two mens liues:
                  But now we must demand what you made here,
                  What busines or condition you professe.

                  Great King, our duty owes to thee our liues,
                  And were we men that striu'd to set a cloud
                  Before these gifts, Art hath instructed vs:
                  Or we haue purchac't at a most deare rate,
                  Of cost and labour, yet thy clemency
                  Commands vs to lay open all to thee,
                  Yet for my selfe I rather count my state,
                  Blest that I lighted on this happy man,
                  Whose accurate and watchfull indagation,
                  Hath taught him for to heale the wounds of Nature,
                  By his exceeding skill in wholesome hearbs,
                  One that when I did thinke my thred of life
                  Had beene quite cut, did tie it vp againe,
                  And make it last: recald my youthfull dayes,
                  And made me Aeson-like becom thus yong,
                  For which great practises I did owe my life,
                  And thence proceeded our late pious strife.

                  Nay then I'me glad our mercy did extend
                  On men whom such rare vertues doe commend;
                  Or loue shall then grow greater, and our court
                  Shall entertaine you, and't may chance we will,
                  My queene and I make triall of your skill.

                  That Nature hath been too vnkind to vs,
                  Yet we would plant each corner of our Realme,
                  With springing branches of our royall selfe,

Stabs the child.

                  O turne thy bloody weapon on my brest▪
                  
                  'Twas this wombe that brought forth this Babe and thee▪
                  
                  If that be guilty, I haue made it so.
                  Rip vp this place which first did bring thee forth▪
                  
                  'Tis I'intreat thee, 'tis the mother, she
                  Which gaue thee house-roome here within this brest,
                  Vpon whose dugs thy infant lips did hang.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  It was my father, he intreated you,
                  Who many a time had clipt you in his armes,
                  Who made you Queene of Greece, yes, it was hee▪
                  
                  
                     Good Agamemnon, he did plead for life.
               
               
                  Aegyst.
                  Bathe not thy hands in a poore infants blood,
                  Nor in thy mothers, I deserue to die:
                  And yet remember how my doome sau'd thee,
                  How easily mercy did obtaine her suit.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Nay, but Aegystheus, you can aggrauate▪
                  
                  To doe a haynous murther, and i'th Court;
                  I'th place of Iustice, where the King might heare,
                  Vpon a chiefe attendant of the Kings.
                  Murther it selfe is past all expiation,
                  A crime that nature most of all abhorres,
                  And looke how manhood and ciuility,
                  Stand at the barre of Iustice, and there plead,
                  How much they'r wrong'd, and how much defac'd,
                  When man doth dye his hands in blood of man.
                  Now harken King, I'll vse thy Rhetorique,
                  Thou didst a haynous murther in the Court,
                  Not which the King did heare, but which he felt;
                  When no petition could (good man) preuaile,
                  Therefore this dies, this first shall haue his due.
Stabs it againe, that the blood spirts in his face. Turnes it to her.
                  
                  This mischiefe done, reuenge shall prompt a new:
               
               
                  Aeg.
                  O, the Gods blush, and heauen looks pale at this,
                  A fathers face besmear'd with his owne blood.

                  My haste deceiues my wil; tush, al this yet,
                  May be call'd piety, you shall taste too mother.
               
               
                  Cly.
                  O, why dos't banish nature from his place?
                  Looke on thy mothers teares' worse then those grones,
                  And pangs she had, when she first brought thee forth,
                  When of thy friends or parents thou hast wrong,
                  Patience, not fury doth to thee belong.
                  Is this the blessing that thy knee should aske?
                  Repay'st thou thus my kisses and my teares,
                  Which flow'd from mee to thee in tender yeeres.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  O why did you so banish woman-hood,
                  When you and this damn'd villaine, base adulterer,
                  Made in my fathers side so many wounds,
                  And brought a braue old King into this state:
Pulls bones from his pocket.
                  
                  See, here's his bones, my pocket can containe
                  Great Agamemnon; and repayd you thus
                  His kind embraces? all his louing signes?
                  
                     
                     Aegysteus, you are thirsty, you shall drinke,
Fills two cups with the Heniochus childs blood: giues it them.
                  
                  Yes, you shal cleare your throat, by heauen you shal.

                  O mischief aboue mischief! what
                  Bred on a stony rock, could e'r endure
                  To see a fathers thirst quench'd with such blood?
                  Hast thou no measure? hath reuenge no end?

                  Who first doth mischiefe, may keep mean i'th deed,
                  But who reuengeth, must all meane exceed.
                  Nay, mother, wee'll not barre you of your draught.

                  O Nature, see here all thy lawe infring'd
                  A mothers prayers preuaile not with her sonne.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Pray with Thyestes, it shall neuer moue me:
                  But first, Aegystheus, do thou haste reuenge.

Stabs her.
                  
                  So now I'll stand and looke, and on hell call,

                  One more for thee. Aegystheus; onely let out,

                  Aegyst.
                  O, my heart feeles it,
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Now mother you, and your loue the same.
               
               
                  Clyt.
                  O kill me quickly, time prolongs my woe,
                  And since I must die, let me quickly goe.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  You know your sentence, let him feele hee dies.

                  This brings ten deaths.
               
               
                  Or.
                  Would't would a hundred bring,
                  One death's too little to reuenge a King.

                  Thy fathers? but on whom? vpon thy mother!
                  On her which brought thee forth, which took most care,

                  Of rotten earth can doe as much to corne,
                  
                     As you to me, beare it, and bring it forth,
                  But Agamemnon he that seed did sow,
                  And onely vnto him my selfe I owe:
                  And for him thou shalt die.

                  O, I confesse,
                  My conscience tells mee, I deserue no lesse:
                  And thus thy mother from thee doth depart,
                  Leauing vexation to torment thy heart:
She dies.

                  My mothers father, did not see her dye.
                  Ile in and tell him, my thoughts must reueale

                  Still would the spots of murder sticke on them.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Why Grandsire, I goe not about to wash,
                  By heauen, 'twas all the fruit thought to win,
                  To thinke all mischiefe here could be no sinne.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  See, see, thy mother, looke vpon her now,
                  On her, whose eyes thou hast for euer clos'd,
                  Which eyes haue often wakned at thy cry,
                  And hush'd thee with a lullaby to sleepe:
                  See, see, these hands, which oft with so much care,
                  Wrapt gently vp thy vnset tender limbs:
                  See, see, this face, wont at thy signes to smile,
                  When nature gaue not leaue vnto thy tongue.
                  To vtter thy childs meaning.
               
               
                  Ore.
                  See, see these bones, these nasty rotten bones,
                  Which had so often lock'd his hands in hers;
                  Here stood the tongue which oft had call'd her sweet,
                  Deare Glytemnestra, and then stopt his speech,
                  And told his loue in a more speaking signe.
                  Here stood those eyes, which fed vpon her face,
                  And made her of thy daughter, a great Queene,
                  And thee made him a dish for loathed wormes.
               
               
                  Tyn.
                  Suppose she did, there was but one yet dead,
                  And with ones death againe should be repaid.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  No, Tyndarus, had I desir'd but one,
                  I should haue thought I had desired none.
                  Why, me thinks, I should too haue kill'd thee,
                  The number is too little yet of three.
               
               
                  Tyn.
                  Into what land, what country wilt thou fly?
                  All earths, all lands, all countries will flie thee:
                  The heauens will look with a more cherefull brow
                  On Cerberus.
                  
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Why, let heauen looke as 'twill, it is my crowne,
                  That I haue done an act shall make heauen frowne:
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  O, what earth loues so much a guilty soule,
                  That it can beare thee?
               
               
                  Ore.
                  Why, Sir, this is mine,
                  And this shall beare mee. Am I not righ heire?
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  Thou heire to kingdomes! thou a subiect rather,
                  To helpe to make a Players Tragedie.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Why, that will make me swell with greater pride,
                  
                     To thinke my name shall drop in lines of blood;
                  From some great poets quils, who well shall paint
                  How brauely I reueng'd my fathers death,
                  That is the thing I wish'd, and 'tis my glory,
                  I shall be matter for so braue a story.
                  But where's my Crowne?
               
               
                  1 Lord.
                  
                  No murderers, wee'll rather ioyne with him,
                  This old man here to take away thy life,
                  Then such an homicide shall frame vs lawes,
                  Who hath himselfe rac'd out the lawes of Nature.
               
               
                  2 Lord.
                  
                  Yes, and wee'll set here Argos Crowne on him,
                  Who shall enact some punishment for thee;
                  Which although none can equalize this deed,
                  Yet what our griefes can thinke, all shall be done,
                  And wee'll forget thou'rt Agamemnons sonne.
               
               
                  Ore.
                  Why, thinke you vpon your worst, I scorne to craue.
                  I had three liues, you but my one shall haue.
               
               
                  Tyn.
                  Then since vile wretch thou hast committed that,
                  Which while there is a world, throughout the world
                  VVill be pronounc'd for the most horrid deede
                  That euer came into the thought of man;
                  A thing which all will talke of, none allow;
                  I here disclaime that name of Grandfather,
                  And I must quite forget that in thy veynes,
                  My blood doth flow, but thinke it then let out,
                  VVhen thou letst out my daughters; and since you
                  Kinde Lords commit the state vnto my yeeres,
                  Yeeres too vnfit, heauens know, to beare a state:
                  My mind, me thinks, contends for to decree
                  Somewhat, which to my selfe I dare not tell:
                  Iust conceiu'd wrath, and my affection striues,
                  Hate forbids pitty, pitty forbids hate,
                  And exile is but barren punishment:
                  Yet let me banish thee from out these eyes,
                  O neuer let thy sight offend me more,
                  All thy confederates, and all thy friends.
                  You, Pylades, wich did so smoothly cloake,
                  The damnde profession hee did vndertake:
                  You, Strophius.
                  
               
               
                  Stroph.
                  My Lord, I know not ought,
                  Yet, since one foot is now in Charons boat,
                  
                     If it please you, let tother too afloate.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  Not so, but I will banish you the court,
                  And you Electra, come, I must forget
                  Affection too towards you, you gaue the child,
                  Which you had charge of to the murderers sword.
               
               
                  Elect.
                  Why Grandsire, I herin no wrong do finde,
                  Since all these goe, I would not stay behinde.
               
               
                  Tyn.
                  Nay, but no one shall company the other,
                  Hence thou Cocytus streame of this offence,
                  
                     Strophius &amp; Pylades, Electra, hence:
Exeunt Stroph. Pyl. Elect.
                  
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Why farewell Grandsire, since thou bidst, I flie,
                  And scorn companions for my misery.
Exit Orest.
                  
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  Vnto this punishment this one more I adde,
                  That none shall dare to giue Orestes foode,
                  And this decree shall stand; I speake with griefe,
                  And here pronounce Orestes no reliefe.
                  Hence with these corps; poore child what hadst thou don?
                  Thy Nurses prayers, that there might spring a rose,
                  Where e're thou trod'st could not keepe backe thy foes.
                  Some plague he hath, but such a matricide
                  Should neuer die, although he euer dide.

                  And sole partaker of our miseries,
                  Why doe we liue, when now 'tis come to passe,
                  It is scarce knowne that Agamemnon was,
                  He dies far easier, who at first doth drowne,
                  Then he which long doth swim, and then sinks down.

                  Nay Neece, me thinks I now doe see the Hauen.
                  Where my ag'de soule, must leaue this tossed barke,
                  Made weak with yeeres and woes, yet I commend
                  Vnto my Son the heart of a true friend,
                  That's all the will I leaue, and let him know
                  Friendship should euer be, but most in woe.
                  
                     And so I leaue thee Neece, I first must die,
                  To haste a periode to this Tragedy.
He dies.

                  O enuious Fates could you not vse me thus?
                  Haue not I griefe inough to burst my heart?
                  Was my life's thred twisted and knit so strong?
                  That the keen edge of all these miseries
                  Can neuer cut it off; Must I beare more?
                  'Tis all my safety now not to be safe,
                  Are there so many wayes to rid ones life?
                  And can I hit on none? they say that death
                  Is euery where, and yet I finde him not:
                  Tush, but I seeke him not, why my owne hand
                  Might graspe him to me, if I did but striue.

Stabs her selfe

                  And let Andromacha my sister see,
                  What Agamemnons race is come to be.
                  Now Troy gratifie that most sad doome,
                  Conquered by those that thus themselus or'ecome,
                  Let Greece so florish still, let Argos be
                  Puft with the pride of their great victory.
                  Let it beare Souldiers, so withall it beare

                     Argos makes me to laugh, which made thee weep,

                  Their sorrow hath the end, now these begin
                  To ouerflow themselues with mutuall sin:
                  And after all, Orestes, we may see,
                  Hath lost his reason, mans sole propertie.

                  THus seeking others, I haue lost my selfe,
                  My friend and father banisht, and whilst I
                  Wander to seeke them for to ease their woe,
                  I heare more griefe proclam'd against my friend,
                  That none must succor, none must giue him foode,
                  And yet I'll seeke him, and should all the lawes,
                  That Tyranny should thinke vpon, restraine,
                  I'de draw my blood forth for let him drinke,
                  But O what's here? O I haue found too sonne,
Spies Stroph. dead.
                  
                  One which I sought, my Fathers wearied soule
                  In sighes hath now expired out it selfe.
                  Now O ye Sisters, your great taske is done,
                  You ne're vntwinde what you haue once begun.
                  Thus obuious to our Fates t'our selues vnkind,
                  We haste to seeke, that which too soone we finde.
                  Alas why doe our souls too greedy burn,
                  To hasten thither whence we ne're return,
                  We run to't of our selues, though death were slow,
                  Should he come tardy, we too soone should goe.
                  For the first day that giues vs our first breath,
                  Doth make vs a day nearer vnto death.

                  Yes, yes thou wert with me when I kild my mother

                  O Clytemnestra, hay, how the lion skips,
                  And Taurus he would tosse me on his hornes.
                  Looke on the Ramme, see the Beare roares at me,
                  And Charon he would fling me into Styx.
                  
               
               
                  Pylad.
                  He feares the heauenly signes, nay then now time
                  Hath brought true punishment on euery crime.

                  It bleeds, it bleeds; so, so Aegystheus, so.
               
               
                  Pylad.
                  O what a strange distemper stirs his braine,
                  Thou gentle Somnus, in whom care doth rest,
                  Kinde father of cold death, and son of peace,
                  Which comes to Kings and poore men all alike:
                  Binde his disturbed braine, tye vp his sense.
                  Let him but liue to die; now tis not long
                  Before we both shall sing our funerall song.

                  Ha, must I sinke, can I not keepe a loft?
Fals a sleepe.
                  
                  What is the streame so strong? why then I'll diue,
                  And come to hell the sooner.

                  So gentle sleepe,
                  Thou gather'st vp his wandring braines againe,
                  This is but halfe dead, yet halfe dead he lies,
                  But tis not long; before he wholly dies.
Musique within.
                  
                  Harke they play musike; O these sounds do harme,
                  Enticing woe with their melodious charme;
                  These please not men in woe; these time doe keepe,
                  But miseries best falling is to weepe.
                  
                     Or stops are nought but sobs, our hearts we bring.
                  Whereon we prickt the soulefa which we sing.
               
               A song within together with the musicke.

                  Where Kings are buried.
                  No heire, no heire is left,
                  But one that's mad,
                  See Argos, hast not thou,
                  Cause to be sad?
                  Sleepe, sleepe wild braine,
                  Rest rocke thy sence;
                  Liue if thou canst
                  To grieue for thy offence.

                  Peace Musique, peace, our plaints haue louder cries,
                  A heart that's sad can neuer harmonize.
                  Griefe cannot keepe his time, all time's too long,
                  Sighs are best sembriefes to his dolefull Song.
                  My ditties mournefull though thou sweetly play.
                  Thus doe we all euen blow our liues away.

                  Then others doe on life; come Tyndarus, see,
                  We scorne to liue when all our friends are dead,
                  Nor shall thy Fury make base famine be
                  The executioner to my dearest friend,
                  Whilst I can kill him, therefore spight of thee,
                  Wee'll free our selues past all calamity,
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Yes Pylades, we will beguile our time,
                  And make him search through euery nooke a'th world,
                  If he in all his race can euer spie,
                  Two that like vs did liue, like vs did die:
                  But we delay our death, now brauely come▪
                  
                  And the last parting word shallbe strike home.
they run at one another run again
                  
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  O brauely rstook deare friend yet once again.
               
               
                  Orst.
                  Yes at one thrust two friends must not be slain,
                  
                     O, how I loue these wounds, heauen dropping showers,
                  When the outragious dogge makes clouds of dust
                  Vpon the thirsty earth, come not more sweet,
                  Then the blest streames of blood, thy rapier raines.
                  Hence weapon: for my loynes now scorne all props,
                  But my friends armes, O, beare good leggs a while,
                  The weight of murder sits vpon my soule,
                  And bends my staggering ioynts vnto the earth.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Haste, haste, I faint, but O, yet let my strength
                  Be Atlas to sustaine the falling world;
                  Breath, breath sweet vapours of two trusty hearts,
                  And let our breaths ascend to heauen before,
                  To make a roome hard by the frozen pole,
                  Where that our winged soules shall mount and sit,
                  More glorious then the Concubines of loue,
                  
                  Wreath'd with a crowne of rich enamel'd starres,
                  Leauing all ages to deplore our death:
                  That friendships abstract perish with our breath:
               
               
                  Orest.
                  Fly thou best part of man, where Hecate
                  
                  Borne on the swarthy shoulders of the Euen,
                  Sits in agroue of oakes, till gray eye'd morne,
                  Bids her to throw off nights blacke Canopie.
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  Wil't die before me? Stay, stay, I come.
               
               
                  Orest.
                  O graspe me then, our names like Gemini,
                  
                  Shall make new starres for to adorne the skie.
                  Is thy breath gone?
               
               
                  Pyl.
                  O, yes, 'tis almost past,
                  Then both together, thus wee'll breath our last.
               
               They fall downe dead, embracing each other.
            
            
               SCEN. VIII.
               Enter in haste Tyndarus, Lords, with others.
               
                  Tynd.
                  WEnt they this way? my Lords, you moue mee much,
                  Could I find him now, I would seat him new,
                  In his right Kingdome, which doth weigh downe mee.
               
               
                  1 Lord.
                  
                  I see my Lord Orestes, and his friend,
                  Without your leaue haue made themselues an end.
               
               
                  Tynd.
                  Then now is Argos Court like to some stage,
                  
                     When the sad plot fills it with murdred Trunckes,
                  And none are left aliue but onely one,
                  To aske the kinde spectators (plaudite)
                  All else haue bid (valete) to the world,
                  The man reseru'd for that, is Tyndarus,
                  
                  Who thus hath seen his childrens childrens end,
                  His Grandchild, a bad sonne, a most deare friend;
                  The Scene must now be ouerflow'd with grones,
                  Each man sits downe to waile his priuate mones:
                  One for the Queen doth weep, one for the King,
                  All taste the bitter waters of this Spring:
                  The Nurse bewails the child, that part she beares,
                  All haue their subiects to bedew with teares;
                  Each one yet haue but one; but all of mee,
                  Challenge a part in griefes sad sympathy.
                  
                     Orestes, Clytemnstra, I must call,
                  These all for mine, thus must I weepe for all:
                  Let none belieue this deed, or if they doe.
                  Let them belieue this punishment then too.
                  'Tis vile to hate a Father, but such loue,
                  As breeds a hate to'th mother, worse doth proue:
                  Our life consists of ayre, our state of winde,
                  All things we leaue behind vs which wee find,
                  Sauing our faults; witnesse Orestes here,
                  VVho was his owne tormentor, his owne feare.
                  VVho flying all, yet could not fly him selfe,
                  But needs must shipwrack vpon murders shelfe:
                  And so his brest made hard with miserie,
                  He grew himselfe to be his enemy.
                  Thus griefe and gladnesse still by turnes do come,
                  But pleasure leastwhile doth possesse the roome.
                  Long nights of griefe may last, but lo, one day
                  Of shining comfort slideth soone away.
                  He, whom all feare on earth, must feare a fate,
                  For all our powers are subordinate:
                  Three howres space thus well can represent,
                  Vices contriu'd and murders punishment.
                  A Monarchs life can in this little space
                  Shew all the pompe that all the time doth grace
                  His risings and his falls, and in one span
                  
                     Of time, can shew the vanity of man.
                  For none of vs can so command the powers
                  That we may say, to morrow shall be ours.
                  Now Fortunes wheele is turn'd, and time doth call,
                  To solemnize this friendly funerall.
                  No force so great, no so disaster wrong,
                  As can vnknit the bands which holdeth strong
                  Vnited hearts: who since they thus are dead,
                  One roome, one tombe shall hold them buried:
                  And as these friends ioyn'd hands to beare their Fate;
                  So we desire you to imitate.
                  VVho since they all are dead, we needs must craue
                  Your gentle hands to bring them to their graue.
               
            
         
         THE END.
