            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the Right worshipfull and famous Gentleman, M. Thomas Candish Esquire, increase of honor and happie attemptes.
            
               IT is now aboue fiue and thirty yeares passed, right worshipfull, since that young sacred, and prudent Prince, king Edward the sixt of happie memorie, went about the discouerie of Cathaia and China, partly of desire that the good young king had to enlarge the Christian faith, and partlie to finde out some where in those regions ample vent of the cloth of England, for the mischiefs that grew about that time neerer home, aswel by contempt of our commodities, as by the arrestes of his merchantes in the Empire, Flanders, France, and Spaine: foreseeing withall how beneficiall ample vent would rise to all degrees throughout his kingdome, and specially to the infinite number of the poore sort distressed by lacke of worke. And although by a voyage hereuppon taken in hande for this purpose by Sir Hugh Willobie, and Richard Chauncellour a discouerie of the bay of Saint Nicolas in Russia fell out, and a trade with the Muscouites, and after another trade for a time with the Persians by way of the Caspian sea ensued, yet the discouerie of the principall intended place followed not in his time, nor yet since, vntill you tooke your happie and renowmed voyage about the worlde in hande, although sundrie attemptes, at the great charges of diuers honorable and well disposed persons, and good worshipfull merchants and others haue beene made since the death of that good king, in seeking a passage thither

both by the North-east, and by the Northwest. But since it is so (as wee vnderstande) that your worshippe in your late voyage hath first of our nation in this age discouered the famous rich Ilandes of the Luzones, or Philippinas, lying neare vnto the coast of China, and haue spent some time in taking good view of the same, hauing brought home three boyes borne in Manilla, the chiefe towne of the said Ilands, besides two other young fellowes of good capacitie, borne in the mightie Iland of Iapon, (which hereafter may serue as our interpretors in our first traficke thither) and that also your selfe haue sailed along the coast of China, not farre from the Continent, and haue taken some knowledge of the present state of the same, and in your course haue found out a notable ample vent of our clothes, especially our kersies, and are in preparing againe for the former voyage, as hee that would constantly perseuer in so good an enterprise: we are to thinke that the knowledge and first discouerie of the same, in respect of our nation, hath all this time beene by the Almightie to you onely reserued, to your immortall glorie, and to the manifest shew of his especiall fauour borne towards you, in that besides your high and rare attempt of sailing about the whole globe of the earth, in so short a time of two yeares and about two monethes, you haue shewed your selfe to haue that rare and especiall care for your countrie, by seeking out vent for our clothes, that ought vpon due consideration to moue many thousands of English subiects to pray for you, and to loue and honor your name and familie for euer. For as you haue opened by your attempt the gate to the spoile of the great and late mightie, vniuersall, and infested enimie of this realme, &amp; of al countries that profes
                  •
               e true religion: so haue you by your great care wrought a way to imploie the merchants of Englande in trade, to increase our Nauie, to benefite our Clothiers, and (your purpose falling out to your hoped effect) to releeue more of the poorer sort, then all the hospitals and almes houses can or may, that haue beene built in this realme, since the first inhabiting thereof.
            And Sir, if to this your late noble attempt, it might

please you, by your incouragement, and by the help of your purse to adde your present furtherance for the passage to be discouered by the northwest, (for proofe whereof there bee many infallible reasons, and diuerse great experiences to 
                  •
               e yeelded) our course with our commodities to the rich Iland of Iapon, to the mightie empire of China, and to the Ilandes of the Philippinas, for the vent that you haue found out, should be by the halfe way shortened, and you should double and manyfolde treble the credite of your fourmer late enterprise, and make your fame to mount, and your self to liue for euer in a much higher degree of glorie, then otherwise it might be, or that by any other mean you could possibly deuise: In which action so highly importing the generall state of this lande I haue perfect experience that many worshipfull and wealthie marchants of this citie and other places would most willingly ioyne their purses with yours: and to play the blabbe, I may tell you they attende nothing with greater desire and expectation, then that a motion hereof being made by some happie man, your selfe and they might friendly and seriously ioyne together for the full accomplishing of this so long intended discouerie. And to descende to 
                  •
               ome particulars, there is one speciall reason that giueth an edge vnto their desires, proceeding from the late worthie attemptes of that excellent and skilful pilot M. Iohn Dauis, made for the search of the aforesaid northwest passage these three late yeares, hauing entred into the same foure hundred leagues further than was euer hitherto thoroughly knowen, and returned with an exact description thereof, to the reasonable contentment for the time, of the aduenturers, and chiefely of the worshipfull M. William Sanderson, whose contributions thereunto, although they haue beene verie great and extraordinarie, yet for the certaine hope or rather assurance that he conceiueth vpon the report of the Captaine himselfe and all the rest of any skill employed in these voyages, remayneth still constant, and is readie to disburse as yet to the freshe setting on foote of this enterprise entermitted by occasion of our late troubles, euen this yeare againe for the finall perfection of so profitable and honorable a discouerie, a

farre greater portion then in reason would be required of any other man of his abilitie. And albeit sir, that you haue taken in your late voyage, besides the knowledge of the way to China, the intelligence of the gouernement of the countrie and of the commodities of the territories and prouinces of the same, and that at the full, according to the time of your short abode in those partes, yet neuerthelesse for that of late more ample vnderstanding hath beene in more length of time, by woonderfull great endeuour taken by certaine learned Portingals and Spaniardes of great obseruation, and not long agoe published in the Spanish tongue, I haue for the increase of the knowledge of the subiectes of Englande, and specially for the illuminating of the mindes of those, that are to take the voyage next in hande to Iapan, China, and the Philippinas, translated the same worke into english, and committed it to print, passing ouer Paulus▪ Venetus, and sir Iohn Mandeuill, because they wrote long agoe of those regions: which labour to say trueth, I haue vndertaken at the earnest request and encouragement of my worshipfull friend Master Richard Hakluit late of Oxforde, a gentleman, besides his other manifolde learning and languages, of singular and deepe insight in all histories of discouerie and partes of Cosmographie: who also for the zeale he beareth to the honour of his countrie and countrimen, brought the same first aboue two yeares since ouer into this court, and at this present hath in hande a most excellent and ample collection of the sundrie trauailes and nauigations of our owne nation, a matter long intended by him, and seruing to the like beneficiall and honorable purpose, which I hope will shortly come to light to the great contentation of the wiser sort. In the meane season, hauing nowe at length finished according to my poore skill and leasure this my translation, I thought best to dedicate and commende the same to your worshipfull patronage, as the man that I holde most worthie of the same, and most able of our nation to iudge aright of the contentes thereof, and to correct the errors of the author whensoeuer you shall meete with them: beseeching you to accept in good part the trauaile and good

meaning of the translator: and so wishing vnto you, health, increase of knowledge, with fortunate and glorious successe in your further couragious attempts, I leaue you to the protection of the almightie.

            The Printer, to the Christian reader.
            WHereas (good courteous Reader) in this historie describing the kingdome of China, with the countries there adiacent, thou shalt finde many times repeated, and that in some things too gloriously, the zeale of certaine Spanish Friers that laboured in discouerie of the saide China
               ▪ and the declaration of certaine myracles (but falsely reported) by them to haue beene wrought, togither with examples of diuerse their superstitious practises: which happily may giue offence vnto some in reading: thou must vnderstande that this is to be rather imputed vnto the first writer of this historie in spanish, than to any fault of mine: for the Spaniardes (following their ambitious affections) doo vsually in all their writinges extoll their owne actions, euen to the setting forth of many vntruthes and incredible things: as in their descriptions of the conquestes of the east and west Indies, &amp;c. doth more at large appeare. Notwithstanding all which, our translator (as it seemeth) hath rather chosen to be esteemed fidus interpres, in truely translating the historie as it was, though conteyning some errors, then to be accounted a patcher or corrupter of other mens workes.
            But howsoeuer, either our first authour, or the translator, haue shewed themselues affectioned, sure I am, that the knowledge of thi
                  •
                kingdome, will not onely be pleasant, but also verie profitable to our English nation: and by playing the good Bee, in onely accepting herein that which is good, I doubt not, but the reading of this historie will bring thee great contentment, and delight.

                  CHAP. I. The description of the kingdome and the confines that it hath belonging.
                  
                     THis great and mightie kingdome of China, which we do meane to treat of in this Historie, hath béene discouered by cléere and true notice, within this tenne yeares, by Spanyards that were dwellers in the Ilands Philippinas, that are three hundreth leagues distant from the said kingdome: Notwithstanding, that long time before, there was relation giuen, by way of the Portingall Indias, by such as dwelt in Macao, and did tra
                        ••
                     ke to Canton, a citie of the same kingdome of China. But this was by relation so, that the one nor the other could satisfie, for that there was founde varietie in that which was true, till the yeere of 1577. Frier Martin de Gorrada prouincial of the Augustine friers, who were the first discouerers of the said Ilands Philippinas, and ministred first the holy baptisme amongst them, with his companions, frier Hieronimo Martin, Pedro Sarmiento, and Myghell de Loarcha chéefe officers of the citie of Marrila in the said Ilands, by the order and commandement of Guido de Labassares gouernour thereof, did enter into the saide kingdome of China, Led and gouerned by a captaine belonging to the king of the said kingdome called Omoncon.
                  
                  Of the comming of this Omoncon, vnto the Ilands Philippinas, and of his hardines to carrie the aforesaid vnto the

firme land, he being commanded to the contrarie vpon paine of death, and how he was receiued, and great courtesie shewed, and of other things verie curious, you shall 
                        •
                     inde in the second part of this historie, where as is the substance and whole relation of all that was brought vnto the king of Spaine.
                  You shall vnderstande that this mightie kingdome is the Orientalest part of all Asia, and his next neighbour towards the Ponent is the kingdome of Quachinchina, whereas they doo obserue in whole all the customes and rites of China. The greatest part of this kingdome is watred with the great Orientall Ocean sea, beginning at the Iland Aynan, which is hard by Quachinchina, which is 19. degrées towards the North, and compassing towards the South, whereas their course is Northeast. And beyond Quachinchina towards the North, the Bragmanes do confine, which are much people and verie rich, of golde, siluer and pretious stones, but in especiall, Rubies: for there are infinit. They are proude and hawtie men, of great corage, wel made, but of browne colour: they haue had (but few times) warre with them of China, in respect for that betwixt both the kingdomes there are great and mightie mountaines and rockes that doth disturbe them. And harde vnto this nation ioyneth the Patanes and Mogores, which is a great kingdome, and warlike people, whose head is the Gran Samarzan: They are the true Scythas or Massagetas, of whom it is affirmed that they were neuer ouercome by any other nation: they are a people well proportioned, and white: by reason they dwel in a cold countrie. Betwixt the West and the South is the Trapobana, or Samatra, a kingdome very rich of gold, pretious stones &amp; pearles: and more towards the South, are the two Iauas, the great and the lesse, and the kingdome of the Lechios: and in equall distance, are the Iapones: yet notwithstanding those that are more indifferent to this kingdome are the Tartarians, which are on the selfe firme land or continent, and are alonely deuided by a wal, as shalbe declared in the 9 chapter of this booke. These Tartarians haue had many times wars with them of China: but at one time (as you shall perceiue) they got the whole kingdome of China, and did possesse the same for the

space of 93. yeares, till such time as they of China did rebell and forced them out againe. At this day they say that they are friends one with another, and that is, for that they bee all Gentiles, and do vse all one manner of ceremonies and rites. They doo differ in their clenes &amp; lawes, in the which the Chinas doth excéede them very much. The Tartarians are very yealow &amp; not so white: and they go naked from the girdlested vpwards, and they eate raw flesh, and do annoint themselues with the blood of raw flesh, for to make them more harder and currish, by reason whereof they doo so stinke, that if the aire doth come from that part where they be: you shall smel them afar off by the strong sauor. They haue for certainty, the truth of the immortalitie of the soule (although it be with error) for they say that the soule doth enter into other bodies, and that soule that liued well in the first bodie, doth better it from poore to rich, or from age to youth: and if it liued euill, to the contrarie in worse. The sons of the Tartarians do very much obserue and kéepe the commandement in obeying their parents, for that they doo wholly accomplish the same without failing any iot of their will, vnder paine to be seuerly and publikelie punished. They confesse one God, whom they worship, &amp; haue him in their houses carued or painted, and euery day they doe offer vnto it incense, or some other swéet smelles: they do call him the high God, &amp; do craue of him vnderstanding &amp; health. They haue also another God, which they say is son vnto the other: they do call him Natigay: this is their God of terestriall things. They haue him likewise in their houses, and euery time they go to eate, they doo annoint his face with the fattest thing they haue to eate: that being doone they fall to eating, hauing first giuen their gods their pitance. They are a kinde of people that verie seldome doo fable a lie, although their liues should lie thereon, and are verie obedient vnto their king: but in speciall in their warres, in the which euerie one doth that he is appointed to doo: they are led by the sound of a drome or trumpet, with the which their captaines do gouerne them with great ease, by reason that they are trained vp in the same from their youth. And many other things are amongst them, in the which they do resemble them of China,
                     
(who) if they did receiue the faith of our Lord Iesu Christ, it is to be beléeued that the Tartarians would do the same, for that they are taken for men very ducible, and do imitate verie much them of China.

                     e then 50. degrées, and yet they do vnderstand that beyond that, there bée more vpon the confines of Tartaria. It is a strange thing to be séene, the strange and great difference betwixt the colours of the dwellers of this kingdome. In Canton a mightie citie, whereas the Portingales had ordinarie traficke with them of China, for that it was nigh vnto Macao, where as they had inhabited long since, and from whence they do bring all such merchandise as is brought into Europe: There is séene great diuersities in the colours of such people as doo come thither to traficke, as the said Portingales do testifie.
                  Those which are borne in the citie of Canton and in al that cost are browne people, like vnto them in the citie of Fez or Barberie, for that all the whole countrie is in the said paralel that Barberie is in. And they of the most prouinces inwards are white people, some more whiter then others, as they draw into the cold countrie. Some are like vnto Spanyards, and others more yealow, like vnto the Almans, yelow and red colour. Finally in all this mightie kingdome, to speake generally, they cannot say that there is much cold or much heat, for that the Geographers do conclude and say it is temperate▪ and is vnder a temperate clime, as is Italy or other temperate countries, wherby may be vnderstood the fertilitie of the same, which is (without doubt) the fortresse in all the world, &amp; may compare with the Peru
                     ▪ and Nuoua Espannia, which are two kingdomes celebrated to be most fertill: and for the

verification, you shall perceius in this Chapter next folowing: wherin is declared such things as it doth yéeld and bring forth, and in what quantitie. And yet aboue all things (according vnto the sayings of fryer Herrada prouinciall and his companions, whose relation I will follow in the most part of this hystorie, as witnesses of sight) vnto whom we may giue certaine credite without any exception: They say that the countrie is so full of youth, that it séemeth the women are deliuered euerie moneth, and their children when they are little, are extreame faire: and the countrie is so fertill and fat, that it yeldeth fruit thrée or foure times in the yéere, which is the occasion that all things is so good cheape, that almost it séemeth, they sell them for nothing.
               
               
                  CHAP III. Of the fertilitie of this kingdome, and of such fruits and other things as it doth yeeld.
                  THe inhabitants in this countrie are perswaded of a truth, that those which did first finde and inhabite in this lande, were the Neuewes of Noe (who after they had traueiled from Armenia, wheras 
                        •
                     he Arke stayed▪ wherin God did preserue their grandfather from the waters of the flood) went séeking a land to their contentment: and not finding a countrie of so great fertilitie and temperature like vnto this, wherein was all things necessarie for the life of man, without comparison: they were compelled with the aboundance thereof for to inhabite therin, vnderstanding that if they should search throughout all the world they should not finde the like: and I thinke they were not deceiued, according as now it is to be séene, and what may be considered in the proces of this chapter, of such fruits as the earth doth yéeld. And although there is declared here of such as shall suffice in this worke, yet is there left behind a great number more: of whose properties, as well of herbes and beasts, which of their particulars may be made a great volume, and I doo beléeue that in time there will be one set forth.
                  The great trauell and continual laboure of the inhabitants

of this countrie, is a great helpe vnto the goodnes and fertilitie thereof, and is so much that they do neither spare nor leaue mountaines nor vallies, neither riuers, but they do sow and plant all such things as they perceiue that the place wil yéeld, according vnto the goodnesse thereof: as orchards with fruite, great fields of wheat, barlie, rice, flaxe and hempe, with many other things: all which traueile vnto them is verie easie, remembring with what great libertie they do inioy their goods, and the great &amp; infinit number of people that there is, as well for handie craftes as for to till and cultiuate the grounde. In all this mightie countrie they doo not suffer vacabunds nor idle people, but all such (ouer and aboue that they are gréeuouslie punished) they are holden for infamous: neither doo they consent nor permit any of them that are naturally borne there, to go out of their countries into other strange countries, neither haue they any wars at this present: which was the thing that in times past did consume much of their people. The king dooth content himselfe onely with his owne kingdome, (as one that is helde the wisest in all the world.) Beside all this they are naturally inclined to eate and drinke wel and to make much of themselues, in apparell, &amp; to haue their houses well furnished with houshold stuffe: and to the augmenting hereof, they doo put themselues in great labor &amp; trauaile, and are great dealers and trafickers: al which with the fertilitie of the countrie aboue said, is the occasion that iustlie it may haue the name to be the most fertilest in all the whole world.
                  This country doth yéeld all kind of herbs, as doth Spaine, and of many kindes mo: also all manner of fruites, like as in Spaine, with diuers other sorts: the names whereof are not yet knowne, for that they do differ very much from ours, but yet the one and the other are of a marueilous excellent tast, as they doo say. They haue thrée sorts of Orenges, the one verie swéete which doth excéede sugar in their swéetnesse: the other sort not so swéet as the first: the third sort are somewhat sower, but verie delightfull in the tast. Also they haue a kinde of plummes that they doo call Lechias,
                     Excellent 
                           •
                        lummes. that are of an excéeding gallant tast, and neuer hurteth any body although they should

eate a great number of them. It yeldeth great aboundance of great melons, and of an excellent sauour and tast, and verie bigge. Also a kinde of russet appels that be very great, of a good tast. I doo not heere declare of other fruites, nor of their names, because I will not séeme tedious vnto the reader, nor spende the time herein, but will treat of other things of more importance.
                  In all parts of this kingdome, there is great store of sugar,Excellent white sugar good cheape▪
                      which is the occasion that it is so good cheape: for you shall haue a quintall of verie excellent white and good sugar, when it is most déerest, for the value of sixe ryals of plate. There is great abundance of honie, for that their delight is in hiues,Honie &amp; wax. by reason whereof not only honie, but waxe is very good cheape: and there is so great quantity therof, that you may lade ships, yea fléetes thereof.Excellent good silke. They do make great store of silke and excellent good, and giue it verie perfite colours, which dooth exceed very much the silke of Granada, and is one of the greatest trades that is in all that kingdome.
                  The veluets, damaskes, sattens, and other sortes of webs which is there made, is of so small price, that it is a wonder to speake it, in especiall vnto them that doo know how their prises be in Spaine and in Italie: They do sell none of their silkes there by the yard, neither any other kinde of websterie, though it be lynnen: but by the waight, wherin there is least deceit. They haue great store of flaxe,Great store of flaxe and hempe. wherwith the common people doo apparell themselues: also hempe for the cawlking of their ships, and to make ropes and hasers. And on their drie and tough landes, although they be stonie, they gather great stoore of cotton wooll. They doo sowe wheate barlie, rye and oates▪ and manie other kindes of graine:Cottō, wool, wheat and barlie, rie, oates. and the one and the other doo yeelde great increase. In the marrish groundes, (of which there be many) by reason of moyst and great aboundance of riuers that be in this countrie, they doo sowe rice,Great abundance of rice. which is a common victuall or mantiniment vnto all people of the kingdome, and vnto them that dwell neere them: and they doo gather so greate aboundance, that when it is most dearest you shall haue a haneg for a ryall of plate: of the which and of all

other graines aforesaid, the countrie was woont to yéeld thrée and foure times in the yéere there increase.
                  On their high grounds that are not good to be sowne, there is great store of pine trées which yéelde fruit very sauorie: chestnuts greater and of better tast then commonly you shall

And of trueth almost in all the whole countrie you shall not finde any ground, that is barren or without profite, what by the naturall vertue of the country, and also by the manuring and helping of it.
               
               
                  CHAP. IIII. Here I do proceed in the fertiltie of this kingdome, and of such things as it doth yeeld.
                  BEsides the fertilitie of this countrie beforesaide, all the fields be verie faire to behold, and yeelde maruelous odoriferous smelles, by reason of the great quantitie of sweete flowers of diuers sorts. It is also garnished with the greene trees that he planted by the riues sides, and brookes: whereof there is great quantitie. And there is planted there, orchards and gardens, with banketing houses of great pleasure: the which they doo vse verie much for their recreation and auoyding the troubles of minde.All kind of beasts. The Loytias or Gentlemen doo vse to plant great forrests and thicke woods, whereas doo bréed many wilde boores, bucks, hares and conyes, and diuers other beasts: of whose skins they make very excellent furres,Excellent furres. Muske. but in especiall of Martas Ceuellinas, of which there is a great number. There is great aboundance of muske, the which they do make of a little beast that doth feede of nothing else but of a roote which is of a maruellous smell, that is called Camarus, as big as a mans finger. They do take them &amp; beat them with blowes till they be brused all to peeces: then they do put them in a place whereas they may soonest putri

There is great aboundance of goates, &amp; of other beasts that are to be eaten: which is the occasion that they are of little value.Great store of wildfoule▪
                      The flying foules that doo breed about the lakes &amp; riuers, are of so great quantitie, that there is spent daily in small villages in that countrie many thousands, and the greatest sort of them are Teales. The fashion how they do breed and bring them vp shalbe declared in a chapter particularly: for that which is said shal not séeme impossible. They be sold by waight,Foule so

                  There are also many herbs for medicines,

Of fish, both swimming and shell fish of all sorts, that they haue with them is to be wondred at: not onely vpon the sea coasts, but also in the remote places of that kingdome,

Great store of pearles. Besides all this it is verie rich of mines of golde and siluer, and other mettals, the which (gold and siluer excepted) they do sell it so good cheape that a quintal of Copper, yron or stéele is to be bought for eight rials of plate. Golde is better cheape there then it is in Europe, but siluer is more woorth. There is founde great store of pearles in all this kingdome: but the most part of them are not rounde, by the which you may gather and vnderstande the goodnesse and fertilitie of the same. And that the first that did discouer and inhabite that kingdome, were not deceiued for that they founde all things necessarie vnto the preseruing of the life of man, and that in aboundance: for the which with iust reason, the inhabitants may thinke themselues to possesse the best and fertilest kingdome in all the whole world.
               
               
                  CHAP. V. Of the antiquitie of this kingdome.
                  AS before is said, this kingdome is of so ancient antiquity that there is opinion, that the first that did inhabite this countrie, were the Neuewes of Noe. But the light which is found in the histories of China, is that from the time of Vitey, who was their first king, and did reduce their kingdome vnto an empire, and hath and doth indure vnto the king that now rayneth: as you shall vnderstand in the place where we shall make mention of the kings of that countrie, whereas you shal vnderstand by iust computation, that vnto this day, there hath reyned naturall and vsurped to the number of 243. kings.243. kings. The sonne doth succeede the father in the kingdome, and for want of a sonne, the next kinsman doth succéed: and for that they do take (after the vse of the emperors of Turkie) so many wiues as pleaseth them: it seldome falleth out to lacke heires, for that the first sonne that is borne of either of his wiues is right heire vnto the kingdome: and the rest of his sonnes he doth appoint them cities where as they do dwel priuately: and there they are prouided of all things necessarie for them, conformable vnto their degrées, with expresse commission

vpon'paine of death, neuer to go out of them, neither to returne vnto the court, except they be sent for by the king. So after this conclusion, all those that are kins
                        •
                     olke vnto the king, are resident and kept in a mightie and populous citie, called Causi,
                     The mightie city of Causie.
                      whereas those whome the king and his counsel do thinke and s

                     e to be men of great wisedome, or giuen to martiall affaires, they doo commande that they neuer goe forth of their houses, to auoide occasions of suspition whereby might grow alterations and treasons against the king. The dwelling places of these prouinces, are mightie and of a huge bignesse▪ for that within the compasse of them, they haue all manner of contentment necessary for them: as gardens, orchards, fishing ponds of diuers sorts, parkes and groues, in the which are all kinde of flying foules, fish and beasts, as are to be found in the mountaines and riuers. And it is walled round about with a stone wall, so that euery house of these séemeth to be a towne. They giue themselues much vnto musike, wherewith they doo passe away the time. And for that they are giuen to pleasure and ease, they are commonly corpulent and fatte, verie faire conditioned and quiet, liberall vnto strangers. These princes in what place so euer they are: the gouernours of the cities are bound to visite them euery festiuall day. Likewise if they doo passe on horsebacke by their doores, they must alight and walke on foote while they haue passed it: and if they be borne in a litle chaire, likewise to come out of the same, and to walke on foote with silence, till they be past. And for that they shall not plead ignorance, the gates of these princes houses are all painted red: so that they being brought vp from their youth, in this straight close and idle life, it is not vnto them tedious, but dooth rather reioyce in the same.
               
               
                  CHAP. VI. The bignesse of this kingdome of China, and of such measures as they do vse in trauaile.
                  THis mightie kingdome which we commonly call China, without knowing any cause or foundation wherefore we

should so cal it. Those countries neere ioyning vnto the same, do call it Sangley: and they in their naturall toonge do cal it Taybiner, the which is to be vnderstood, nothing but a kingdome: and is the most biggest and populous that is mentioned in all the world, as it shalbe apparant in the discourse of this hystorie, and in the wonderfull things that shalbe treated of in the next chapter following. All the which is taken out of the bookes and hystories of the said Chinos, whereas they do make mention of the mightinesse thereof, and of the 15. prouinces that are comprehended in the same: The which bookes and hystories were brought vnto the citie of Manilla, printed and set forth in China, and were translated into the spanish toong, by interpreters of the saide nations. And for that they were baptised and became Christians: they remaine as dwellers amongest vs in these Ilandes, the better to obserue and keepe the lawes of baptisme, and to flie the paine &amp; punishment the which they should receiue for dooing the same: for that they turned Christians and receiued the faith without the license of the king and counsell, which is forbidden vppon paine of death, and is executed with great violence, and without remission. This mightie kingdome is in circuit or compasse about 69516. Die, which is a kind of measure that they do vse: which being reduced into the spanish account, is almost 3000. leagues,The China is in compas 3000. leagues and 1800. 
                           •
                        eagues long. and in length 1800. leagues, this is to be vnderstood the whole 15. prouinces: the which are garnished with many cities and townes, besides a great number of villages, as you may plainely see in the chapter following. By the said booke it is found that the Chinos haue amongst them, but only three kind of measures: the which in their language are called Lii, Pu, and Icham, which is as much to say, or in effect, as a forlong, league, or iorney: the measure which is called Lii, hath so much space as a mans voice in a plaine grounde may bee hearde in a quiet day, halowing or whoping with all the force and strength he may: and ten of these Liis maketh a Pu, which is a great spanish league: and ten Pus maketh a dayes iourney, which is called Icham, which maketh 12. long leagues. By the which account it is founde that this kingdome hath the number of leagues

as a
                        •
                     ore is saide: Yet by the account of other bookes, they do finde it bigger and of more leagues. Yet frier Martin de Herrada, prouinciall of the austen friers in the Ilands Philippinas, who is an excellent Geometrician and Cosmographer, did cast the account with great diligence▪ by their owne descriptions, and doth finde it to amount vnto the sum aforesaid, to be 1800. leagues long, and 3000. leagues in compasse, beginning at the prouince of Olam, which is that towards the South, and nearest vnto Malacia, and so alongst the countrie towards the North east, for the space of 600. leagues.

The occasion why the king is alwayes resident or abiding in one of these two prouinces, which are two of the mightiest, and most popularst of people, is not for that in them he is most at his content, or receiue more pleasure in them then in any of the other: but onely for that they doo con

                     ine vpon the kingdome of Tartaria, with whom in times past they had ordinary and continuall wars: and for that the king might with more ease put remedie in such harmes receiued, and defend with better oportunitie the rage of his enimie, he did ordaine and situate his pallace and court in them two. And for that it hath béene of antiquitie many yeeres past, it hath remained hitherto, and appeareth to continue still the habitation of the kings of that kingdome, as by desert for the excellencie of the clime, and aboundance of all things necessarie.
                  The names of the fiftéene prouinces are as followeth: Pag

                        , Chequeam, Susuam, and Saxij. Almost all these prouinces, but in particular tenne of them which are alongst the sea costs, are full of déepe riuers of swéete water and nauigable, vpon whose branches are situated many cities and townes, whereof you may not onely haue the number of them, but also their names: for that these Chinos are so curious people, that in their books are named besides the cities and townes, the banketing houses and houses of pleasure, which the gentlemen haue for their recreation. And for that it will be more trouble then profite to inlarge any further in this matter, I will refer it vnto the next chapter, where I will intreate of the cities and townes, that either of these prouinces hath, and passe ouer all the rest, as not necessarie: for our intent is to set forth the bignes of this kingdome.
               
               
                  CHAP. VIII. Of the cities and townes that euery one of these prouinces hath in himselfe.

                     d of in al the whole world. The Chinos doe vse in their pronunciation to terme their cities with this sylable, Fu, that is as much to say, citie, as Taybin fu, Canton fu, and their townes with this sylable Cheu, They haue some villages that are so great; that it lacketh but onely the name of a towne. All their cities for the most part are situated by the riuers sides: such as are nauigable, the cities are moted rounde about, which make them to bee verie strong, not only the cities but townes are walled round about with high and strong wals of stone, one faddome high, and all the rest is of bricke, but of so hard a substance that it is not to be broken almost with pickaxes. Some cities hath their wals so broad, that 4. and 6. men may walke side by side on them: they are garnished with many bulworks and towers, a small distance the one from the other, with their battlements &amp; faire galleries, where as many times their vizroyes dooth goe to recreate themselues with the gallant sight of the mountaines and riuers, with their fields so odoriferous. There is betwixt the wals of their cities &amp; the mote of the same a broade space, that six horsemen may ride together, the like space is within, betwixt the walles and the houses, whereas they may walke without impediment. Their wals are kept in such good reparation, by reason of their great care and diligence, that they séeme to be but new made, &amp; yet in some cities there is founde mention of two thousand yeeres since the first foundation. In euery citie the king doth ordaine a Iustice, and giueth him great rents onely to visit them, and make them to be renewed and repaired where as is requisite, and is done vpon the kings cost: for out of his rents in such cities &amp; townes is giuen them all that is néedfull to be asked. The high waies in all this

kingdome are made &amp; kept plaine with great care &amp; diligence, and the entering into the cities and townes are very sumptuous and with great maiestie, they haue thrée or foure gates bound with yron very strong. Their streetes verie well paued, and so broad that 15. horsemen may ride together in them, and so straight, that although they be very long, yet you may discouer the end: On both the sides are portals, vnder which be their shops full of all sorts of merchandises very curious, and of all occupations that you will desire: In the streets a good space the one from the other, are made manie triumphall arkes of extreme bewtie: They are made of masons worke, verie curiously painted after the fashion of the old antiquitie of Rome: All their houses ordinarily haue three doores, that in the middest is great, the other be lesser, but of a maruellous gallant propotion: The king is alwayes resident in the citie of Suntien,
                     The mightie citie called Suntien, or Quinsay.
                      which in their language is as much to say, the citie of heauen. Of which citie the Chinos do declare many things which séemeth to be true, for that if you do talke with many of them, and at sundrie times and places, yet doo they not varie the one from the other: and according to their report, it should be greatest in all the worlde, in these dayes. They who do make it to be least, do affirme, that to goe from gate to gate leauing the suburbs, had néed of a summers day and a good horse to do it: it is also called Quinsay, as Marcus Paulus doth call it.
               
               
                  CHAP. IX. Of the wonderfull buildings in this kingdome, and of mightie wall or circuit in the same of 500. leagues long.
                  IN this kingdome in al places there be men excellent in architecture: and the necessaries that they haue to build with is the best that is in the world. For as it is said in the chapter past, they haue a kinde of white earth of the which they make brickes, of so great hardnesse and strength, that for to breake them, you must haue pickaxes, and vse much strength: and this is the cause that in all the kingdome there is mightie

buildings and verie curious. Putting apart the kings pallace where hee is resident in Taybin, (for of that you shall haue a particular chapter:) in all such cities that bee the heads of the prouinces, is resident a vizroy or gouernour, and dwelleth in the house that (in euery such citie) the king hath ordeined on his proper cost: all the which to conclude are▪ superbious and admirable, and wrought by marueilous art, and are as bigge as a great village, by reason that they haue within them great gardens, water ponds &amp; woods compassed about: in the which (as it is declared in the 4. chapter) is great quantitie of hunt and flying foules. Their houses commonly be verie gallant, and after the manner of Rome, and generallie at the doores and gates of them are planted trées in gallant order: the which maketh a gallant shadow and séemeth well in the stréets. All these houses are within as white as milke, in such sort that it séemeth to bee burnished paper. The floares are paued with square stones verie broad and smooth: their seelings are of an excellent kind of timber, verie well wrought and painted, that it séemeth like damaske and of the colour of gold, that sheweth verie well: euerie one of them hath three courts and gardens full of flowers and herbes, for their recreation. And there is none of them but hath his fish poole furnished, although it bee but small. The one side of their courts is wrought verie gallant: like as it is in counting houses, vpon the which they haue many idols carued, and wrought of diuers kinds ofmettals: the other thrée parts or angles of their courts, are painted with diuers things of verie great curiositie. But aboue all things they are marueilous cleane, not onely in their houses, but also in their stréetes: in the which commonly they haue thrée or foure necessarie or common places of ease, verie curiously ordained and placed, for that the people being troubled with their common necessitie shall not foule the streetes, and therefore they haue this prouision: the like is vsed in all wayes throughout the kingdome. Some cities there be, whose streets be nauigable, as in Bruxels in Flanders, Mexico in the Indians, and as in Venice in Italie: which is the occasion that they are better serued and prouided, for that their barkes and boates doo enter laden with all kinde of victuals harde to their doores.
                  
                     The highwayes throughout all this kingdome, are the best and gallantest paued, that euer hath béene discouered: they are verie plaine, yea vnto the mountaines, and they are cut by force of labour and pickaxes, and maintained with bricke and stone, the which by report of them which hath séene it, is one of the worthiest things that is in all the realme. There are many mightie bridges, and of a wonderfull making, &amp; some wrought vpon boats, as it is in Syuill: but in especiall vpon such riuers as are broad and déepe. In the citie of Fucheo, there is a towre right against the house of the kings chiefe receiuer, &amp; it is affirmed by those that haue séene it, to surmount any building that hath béene amongst the Romanes: the which is raised and founded vppon fortie pillars, and euerie pillar is of one stone, so bigge and so high that it is strange to tell them, and doubtfull to the hearers to beléeue it: for which cause I thinke it best not to declare it in particular, as I do in all things where as I doo finde it difficult to be beléeued, and where I haue no certaine author to verifie the truth.
                  There is in this kingdome a defence or wall that is fiue hundred leagues long,A wal of 500 leagues long. and beginneth at the citie Ochyoy which is vppon the high mountaines, and runneth from the West vnto East. The king of that countrie which made it was called Tzintzon, and it was for his defence against the Tartaries, with whome he had warres: so that the wall doth shut vp all the frontier of Tartaria. But you must vnderstande that foure hundred leagues of the saide wall is naturall of it selfe, for that they be high and mightie rockes verie nigh together: but the other hundred leagues is comprehended the spaces or distance that is betwixt the rockes, the which he caused to be made by mens handes of verie strong worke of stone, and is of seuen fathom brode at the foote of it, and seuen fathom high. It beginneth at the partes of the sea, in the prouince of Canton, and stretcheth foorth by that of Paguia and Causay, and doth firnish in the prouince of Susuan. This king for to finish this wonderful worke, did take of euerie thrée men one thorough his kingdome, and of 
                        •
                     iue two: who for that they trauailed in their labour so long a iourney, and into different clymes, (although that out of those prouinces that were nearest, there came great store of people) yet did they almost

all perish that followed that worke.
                  The making of this superbious and mightie worke, was the occasion that his whole kingdome did rise vp against the king, and did kill him, after that he had raigned fortie yeares, and also a sonne of his that was called Aguitzi. The report of this wall is helde to be of a verie truth, for that it is affirmed by all the Chinos that doo traficke to the Ilands Philippinas and to Canton, and Machao, and bee all confirmable in their declaration as witnesses, because they haue seene it: and it is the farthest parts of all the kingdome, whereas none of vs vnto this day hath béene.
               
               
                  CHAP. X. Of the dispositions, countenance, with apparell and other exercises of the people of this countrie.
                  BOth men and women of this countrie are of a good disposition of their bodies, well proportioned and gallant men, somewhat tall: they are all for the most part brode faced, little eyes and 
                        •
                     lat noses, and without bearde saue onely vppon the ball of the chinne: but yet there be some that haue great eyes and goodly beardes, and their faces well proporcioned, yet of these sorts (in respect of the others) are verie few: and it is to bée beléeued that these kinde of people doo procéede of some strange nation, who in times past when it was lawfull to deale out of that countrie, did ioyne one with another.
                  Those of the prouince of Canton (which is a whot country) be browne of colour like to the Moores: but those that be farther within the countrie be like vnto Almaines, Italians and Spanyardes, white and redde, and somwhat swart. All of thē do suffer their nailes of their left hande to grow very long, but the right hand they do cut: they haue long haire, &amp; estéeme it very much &amp; maintaine it with curiositie: of both they make a superstition, for that they say thereby they shalbe carried into heauen. They do binde their haire vp to the crowne of their heade, in calles of golde verie curious and with pinnes of the same.
                  
                     The garments which the nobles and principals do vse, bee of silke of different colours, of the which they haue excellent good and verie persite: the common and poore people doo apparell themselues with another kinde of silke more courser, and with linnen, serge and cotton: of all the which there is great aboundance. And for that the countrie for the most part is temperate, they may suffer this kinde of apparell, which is the heauiest that they doo vse: for in all the whole kingdome they haue no cloth,Great abundance of wool and good cheape. neither doo they suffer it to bee made, although they haue great aboundance of woolles, and very good cheape: they do vse their coates according vnto our old vse of antiquitie, with long skirts, and full of plaites, and a flappe ouer the brest to be made fast vnder the left side, the sleeues verie bigge and wide: vpon their coates they doo vse cassockes or long garments according vnto the possibilitie of either of them, made according as wee do vse, but only their sleeues are more wider. They of royall bloode and such as are constituted vnto dignitie, do differ in their apparell from the other ordinarie Gentlemen: for that the first haue their garments laide on with gold and siluer downe to the waste, and the others alonely garnished on the edges, or hem: they do vse hose verie well made and stitched,
                        Shooes and bus kines of veluet.
                        Great abundance of Marters furres.
                      shooes and buskins of veluet, verie curious. In the winter (although it be not verie colde,) they haue their garments furred with beasts skins, but in especiall with Martas Ceuellinas, of the which they haue great aboundance (as aforesaide) and generally they do vse them at all times about their necks. They that be not married doo differ from them that be married, in that they do kirrle their haire on their foreheade, and weare higher hattes. Their women doo apparell themselues verie curious
                        •
                     ie, much after the fashion of Spaine
                        •
                      they vse many iewels of gold &amp; pretious stones: their gownes haue wide sleeues, that wherwith they do apparell themselues is of cloath of gold and siluer and diuers sorts of silkes, whereof they haue great plentie, as aforesaid, and excellent good, and good cheape: and the poore folkes doo apparell themselues with veluet, vnshorne veluet and serge. They haue verie faire haire, and doo combe it with great care and diligence, as do the women of Genouay, and do binde it about their heade with a broad 
                        •
                     ilke lace, set full of pearles and pretious stones,

and they say it doth become them verie well: they doo vse to paint themselues, and in some place in excesse.
                  Amongst them they account it for gentilitie and a gallant thing to haue little féete,An il vse and custome. and therefore from their youth they do swadell and binde them verie straight, and do suffer it with patience: for that she who hath the least féete is accounted the gallantest dame. They say that the men hath induced them vnto this custome, for to binde their féete so harde, that almost they doo loose the forme of them, and remaine halfe lame, so that their going is verie ill, and with great trauell: which is the occasion that they goe but little abroad, and fewe times doo rise vp from their worke that they do: and was inuented onely for the same intent.A good custome to auoid inconueniences. This custome hath indured manie yeares, and will indure many more, for that it is stablished for a law: and that woman which doth breake it, and not vse it with her children, shalbe counted as euill, yea shalbe punished for the same. They are very secreat and honest, in such sort that you shall not sée at any time a woman at her window nor at her doores: and if her husband doo inuite any person to dinner, she is neuer séene nor eateth not at the table, except the gest be a kinsman or a very friende: when they go abroade to visite their father, mother, or any other kinsfolkes, they are caried in a little chaire by foure men, the which is made close, and with lattises rounde about made of golde wyre and with siluer, and curteines of silke: that although they doo sée them that be in the streete, yet they cannot be seene: they haue many seruants waiting on them. So that it is a great maruell when that you shall meete a principall woman in the streete, yea you will thinke that there are none in the citie, their keeping in is such: the lamenes of their feete is a great helpe thervnto, The women as well as the men be ingenious,Ingenious people. they doo vse drawne workes and carued workes, excellent painters of flowers, birds and beasts, as it is to be séene vpon beddes and bords that is brought from thence. I did sée my selfe, one that was brought vnto Lysborne in the yeare 1582. by captaine Ribera, chiefe sergant of Manilla, that it was to be wondred at the excellencie thereof: it caused the kings maiestie to haue admyration, and he is a person that little wondreth at things. All the people did wonder at it: yea the famous imbroderers

did maruaile at the curiousnesse thereof. They are great inuenters of things, that although they haue amongst them many coches and wagons that goe with sailes,Wagōs with sailes. and made with such industrie and policie that they do gouerne that with great ease: this is crediblie informed by many that haue séene it: besides that, there be many in the Indies, and in Portugall that haue séene them painted vpon clothes, and on their earthen vessell that is brought from thence to be solde: so that it is a signe that their painting hath some foundation. In their bying and selling they are verie subtill, in such sort that they will depart a haire. Such merchants as do kéepe shoppes (of whom in euery citie there is a great number) they haue a table or signe hanging at their doore, whereon is written all such merchandise as is within to be sold.Cloth of gold tissue &amp; silke. That which is commonly sold in their shops is cloth of golde and siluer, cloth of tissue, silkes of diuers sorts and excellent colours: others there be of poorer sort that selleth serges, péeces of cotton, linnen and fustian of all colours: yet both the one and the other is verie good cheape, for that there is great aboundance, and many workemen that do make it. The Apothecarie that selleth simples, hath the like table:Por
                           ••
                        an. there be also shops full of earthen vessels of diuers making: redde, gréene, yellow and gilt: it is so good cheape that for foure rials of plate they giue fiftie péeces: they make them of very strong earth, the which they doo breake all to péeces and grinde it, and put it into sesternes with water, made of lime and stone, and after that they haue well tumbled and tossed it in the water: of the creame that is vpon it they make the finest sort of them, &amp; the lower they go, spending that substance, that is the courser: they make them after the forme and fashion as they do here, and afterward they do gild them, and make them of what colour they please, the which will ne
                     
                        •
                     er be lost: then they put them into their killes and burne them. This hath béene séene and is of a truth, as appeareth in a booke set foorth in the Italian toonge, by Duardo Banbosa, that they doo make them of periwinkle shelles of the sea: the which they do grinde and put them vnder the ground to refine them, whereas they lie 100. yeares: and many other things he doth treat of to this effect. But if that were true, they should not make so great a number of them as is made in that kingdome,

and is brought into Portugall, and carried into the Peru, and Noua Espania, and into other parts of the world: which is a sufficient proofe for that which is said. And the Chinos do agrée to this to be true. The finest sort of this is neuer carried out of the countrie, for that it is spent in the seruice of the king, and his gouernours, &amp; is so fine and cléere, that it séemeth to be of fine and perfite cristall: that which is made in the prouince of Saxii is the best and finest.All occupations bee in streetes by themselues. Artificers and mechanicall officers doo dwell in stréets appointed, whereas none doo dwell amongst them, but such as be of the same occupation or arte: in such sort that if you doo come at the beginning of the stréet, looke what craft or art they are there, it is to be vnderstood that all that streete are of that occupation. It is ordayned by a law and statute, that the sonne shall inherite his fathers occupation,The son inherits his fathers occupation. and shall not vse any other without licence of the Iustice: if one of them bee verie rich and will not worke, yet he cannot let but haue in his shop men that must worke of his occupation. Therefore they that do vse it, by reason that they are brought vp in it from their youth, they are famous and verie curious in that which they do worke, as it is plainelie séene in that which is brought from thence to Manilla, and into the Indies, and vnto Portugall: Their currant monie of that kingdome is made of golde and siluer, without any signe or print, but goeth by waight: so that all men carrieth a ballances with them, and little péeces of siluer and golde, for to buy such things as they haue néede of. And for things of a greater quantitie they haue bigger ballances in their houses &amp; waights that are sealed, for to giue to euery man that which is theirs: for therein the iustices haue great care. In the gouernement of Chincheo they haue copper monie coyned, but it is nothing woorth out of that prouince.
               
            
            
               
               The history of the mighty kingdome of China, wherein shalbe declared, of the religion that is amongst the people, and of their idols that they do worship, and of other things touching that they do vse aboue nature. The second Booke.
               
                  CHAP. I. Of the number of gods that they doo worship, and of some tokens and paintings that is found amongst them that do represent a mysterie of our Christian religion.
                  
                     IN the two prouinces, Paguina an Tolanchia, wheras we haue said, the king of the countrie is ordinarily resident, for that they do bound vpon Tartary, with whom they haue had continuall warres: and againe the most principall and politike people be in those places, ouer and aboue all the other.
                  Amongst the figures of all their idols that they haue, the Chinos doo say that there is one of a strange and maruellous making,A strange image. vnto whom they do great reuerence: they doo paint him a bodie with thrée heads, that doth continually looke the one on the other: and they say that it dooth signifie, that all thrée be of one good will and essence, and that which pleaseth the one pleaseth the other: and to the contrarie, that which is grieuous and displeaseth the one, is grieuous and displeaseth the other two:A mysterie of the trinitie. the which being interpreted christianly, may be vnderstoode to be the mysterie of the holy trinitie, that wee that are christians doo worship, and is part of our faith: the which with other things séemeth somwhat to be respondent to our holy sacred and christian religion▪
                     S. Thomas preached in this kingdome. so that of verie truth we may presume that saint Thomas the Apostle did preach in this kingdome, who as it is declared in the lesson on his day. After that he had receiued the holy ghost, and preached the holy gospel vnto the Parthes, Medes, Persas, Brachmanes and

other nations, he went into the Iudias,The martyrdome of saint Thomas. whereas he was martyred in the citie of Calamina, for his faith and holy gospel that he preached.
                  It is verified that when this glorious apostle did passe into the Indies, hee trauelled through this kingdome of China, where as it appeareth he did preach the holy gospel and mysterie aforesaid, of the holy trinitie: whose picture in the manner aforesaid doth indure vnto this day, although those people, by the great and long blindnesse which they are in with their errors and idolatrie, doo not perfectly knowe what that figure with thrée heads doth represent or signifie. The better for to beléeue that which is said, or at least to vnderstande that it is so, is that it is found in the writings of the Armenians, that amongst them are in reputation and of great authoritie: &amp; there it saith that this glorious apostle did passe through this kingdome of China, when he went into the Indies, where he was martyred, &amp; that he did preach there the holy gospell, although it did profite verie little, for that the people were out of order, and occupied in their warres: and therefore this Apostle did passe into the Indies, and left some of the countrie (although but a few) baptised and instructed, that when it should please God, they might haue occasion to perseuer in that which was taught them.
                  They haue also amongst them (as it is said) certaine pictures after the fashion and with the ensignes of the twelue apostles, which is a helpe to the verifying of that aforesaide: although if you doo aske of the people who they are, they doo answere that they were men, and great philosophers that did liue vertuouslie, and therfore they are made angels in heauen. They doo also vse amongst them the picture of a woman verie faire with a man childe in her armes, whereof they say shée was deliuered and yet remained a virgine, and was daughter vnto a mightie king: they doo reuerence her verie much, and do make prayer vnto her: more then this, they cannot say of this mysterie, but that she liued a holy life and neuer sinned.
                  Frier Gaspar de la Cruz a Portugall of the order of saint Dominicke, was in the citie of Canton, where he did write many things of this kingdome, and with great attention, whom I do follow in many things in the proces of this hystorie,

and he saith, that he being vpon a small Iland that was in the middest of a mightie riuer, there was a house in manner of a monastery of religious people of that country, and being in it, he saw certaine curious things of great antiquitie: amongst them he saw a chappel like vnto an oratorie or place of prayer, verie well made, and curiouslie dressed: it had certaine staires to mount into it, and compassed about with gilte grates, and was made fast: and looking vpon the altar, the which was couered with a cloth verie rich: hee sawe in the midedst of the same an image of a woman of a meruailous perfection, with a childe hauing his armes about hir necke, and there was burning before her a lampe: he being amased at this sight, he did demande the signification: but there was none that could declare more thereof then that which is saide before. Of this which hath ben said, it is easily to be beléeued how that the apostle S. Thomas did preach in this kingdom, for that it is séene, these people haue conserued these traditions many yeares past, and doo conserue the same: which is a signe &amp; token that they had some notice of the true God, whose shadows they do represent. There is amongst them many errors, and without anie foundation, and is not of them to be séene nor perceiued til such time as by faith they shall knowe the right God: as may bee séene in the chapters, where we shall speake of these matters.
               
               
                  CHAP. II. I do prosecute the religion they haue, and of the Idols they do worship.
                  OUer and aboue that which is sai
                        •
                     e, these Idolaters and blind people (being men so prudent &amp; wise in the gouernement of their common wealth, and so subtill and ingenious in all arts) yet they do vse many other things of so great blindnes and so impertinent, that it doth make them to woonder, which attentiuelie doo fall in the consideration: yet is it not much to be meruailed at, considering that they are without the cléere light of the true Christian religion, without the which the subtilest and delicatest vnderstandings are lost and ouerthrowne. Generally amongst them they doo vnderstand that the heauen is the creator of all things visible and inuisible: and therefore

they do make a shew of it in the first caract or letter of the crosse row, &amp; that the heauen hath a gouernour to rule all such things as are comprehended there aboue: whom they call Laocon Tzautey, which is to be vnderstood in their language: the gouernour of the great and mightie God, this they do worship as the principall, next vnto the sun. They say that this gouernour was not begotten, but is eternal, and hath no body, but is a spirit. Likewise they do say that with this there is another of the same nature, whom they call Causay, and is like wise a spirit, and vnto this is giuen power of the lower heauen, in whose power dependeth the life and death of man. This Causay hath thrée subiectes whom he doth commande, and they say they bee likewise spirites, and they doo aide and helpe him in things touching his gouernement. They are called Tauquam, Teyquam, Tzuiquam, either of them hath distinct power the one ouer the other: they say that Tauquam hath charge ouer the raine, to prouoke water for the earth, and Teyquam ouer humane nature, to bring forth mankinde: ouer warres, sowing the ground and fruites. And Tzuiquam ouer the seas and all nauigators. They doo sacrifice vnto them, and doo craue of them such things as they haue vnder their charge and gouernement: for the which they do offer them victuals, swéete smels, frontals and carpets, for their altars: likewise they promise many vowes and represent plaies and comedies before their Idols, the which they do verie naturallie.
                  Besides this, they haue for saints, such men as haue surmounted other in wisedome, in valour, in industrie, or in leading a solitarie or asper life: or such as haue liued without doing euill to any. And in their language they cal them Pausaos, which be such as we do call holy men.
                  They likewise doo sacrifice vnto the diuell, not as though they were ignorant that he is euill, or condemned, but that he shoulde doo them no harme, neither on their bodies nor goods. They haue manie strange gods, of so great a number, that alonely for to name them, is requisite a large hystorie, and not to be briefe as is pretended in this booke: And therefore I will make mention but of their principals, whom (besides those which I haue named) they haue in great reuerence.
                  
                     The first of these they doo call Sichia, who came from the kingdome of Tranthlyco which is towards the west: this was the first inuenter of such religious people, as they haue in their countrie both men and women, and generally doth liue without marrying in perpetuall closenesse. And all such as doo immitate this profession do weare no haire, which number is great, as hereafter you shall vnderstand: and they greatly obserue that order left vnto them.
                  The next is called Quanina, and was daughter vnto the king Tzonton, who had thrée daughters, two of them were married, and the third which was Quanina, hee woulde also haue married, but she would neuer consent thereunto: saying, that she had made a vow to heauen to liue chast, whereat the king her father was verie wroth, and put her into a place like vnto a monasterie, whereas she was made to carrie wood and water, and to worke and make cleane an orcharde that was there. The Chinos do tell many tales of this maide, for to be laughed at: saying, that the apes came from the mountaines for to helpe her, and how that saints did bring her water: and the birds of the aire with their bylles did make cleane her orchard, and that the great beastes came out of the mountaines and brought her woode. Her father perceiuing that, imagining that she did it by witchcraft, or by some art of the diuell, (as it might well bee) commanded to set fire on that house whereas she was: then she séeing that for her cause that house was set on fire, she would haue destroyed her selfe with a siluer pinne, which she had to trim vp her haire, but vpon a sodaine at that instant there fel a great shower of raine and did put out the fire, and shee departed from thence and hid her selfe in the mountaines, whereas she liued in great penance and led a holy life. And her father in recompence of the great sinne and euill he committed against her, was turned to a lepar, and full of wormes, in such sort that there was no phisition that could cure him: by reason whereof hee was constrained to repaire vnto his daughter to séeke cure, (which being aduised of the same by reuelation of a deuine spirit) then her father being certified thereof, did craue pardon at her handes, and did repent him verie much of that which he had done, and did worshippe vnto her, the which she séeing, resisted her father therein, and

put a saint before him, that he should worship it and not her, and therewith shee straight waies returned vnto the mountaines, whereas she died in great religion. This they haue amongest them for a great saint, and doe pray vnto her to get pardon for their sinnes of the heauen, for that they do beleeue that she is there.
                  Besides this, they haue another saint which they call Neoma, and was borne in a towne called Cuchi, in the prouince of Ochiam. This they saye was daughter vnto a principall man of that Towne, and would neuer marrie, but left her owne naturall soyle and went vnto a little Iland, which is right ouer against Ingoa, whereas she liued a verie straight life, and shewed manie false miracles· The occasion why they haue her in reputation of a saint, is. There was a certaine Captaine of the king of China, whose name was Compo: he was sent vnto a kingdome not farre from thence to make warre against the king, It so chaunced that he with his nauie came to an anker at Buym, and being readie to departe, hee would haue wayed his ankers, but by no meanes he could not mooue them: being greatly amazed thereat, and looking foorth he sawe this Neoma sitting on them. Then the Captaine came vnto her and told her with great humilitie that hee was going to warres by commandement of the king. And that if so be she were holie, that she would giue him counsell what were best for him to do, to whom she answered and sayd, that if he would haue the victorie ouer them that hee went to conquer, that he should carrie her with him. He did performe that which she said and carried her with him vnto that kingdome, whose inhabitantes were great Magicians, and threw oyle into the sea, and made it séeme that their shippes were all on fire. This Neoma did worke by the same art, and did vndoe that which the other did practise or imagine, in such sort, that their magicke did profitte them nothing, neither could they doe anie harme vnto them of China. The which being perceiued by them of y• kingdome, they did yeeld themselues to be subiectes and vassales vnto the king of China. The Captaine beléeued this to be a myracle, yet notwithstanding he did coniure her (as one of good discretion) for that thinges might fall out to the contrarie, and the better to certifie his opinion,

whereby hee might the better giue relation thereof vnto the king,A false myracle. he said. Ladie turne me this rodde the which I haue in my hand drie, to become gréene and florishing, and if you can so do, I will worship you for a saint. Then she at that instant did not onely make it gréene, but also to haue an odoriferous smell. The which rod hee put vpon the poope of his ship for a remembrance, and for that he had a verie prosperous and good viage, he did attribute it vnto her. So that vnto this day, they haue her in reputation of a saint, and carrie her picture vpon the poope of their ships, and such as be traueilers to the sea doo offer vnto her sacrifices.
                  These aforesaide they doo estéeme for their principall saints, yet besides all these they haue an infinite number of carued idols, which they doo place vpon alters in their tempels: the quantitie of them is such (that in my presence it was affirmed by frier Geronimo Martin, he that entred into China, and is a man of great credite woorthy to giue credite vnto, that amongst many other things, he was in one of their temples in the cittie of Vcheo, where as hee did count one hundred and twelue idols: and besides this they haue manie in the high wayes and stréetes, and vppon their principall gates of the citie, the which they haue in small veneration, as you shall perceiue in this chapter following: whereby it is plainelie to be séene, in what subiection they are vnto errours and Idolatrie, such as doo lacke the trueth of true Christian religion.
               
               
                  CHAP. III. How little they doo esteeme their Idols whome they worshippe.
                  THese miserable Idolaters doo so little estéeme their Idols, that it is a great hope and confidence, that at what time so euer the gospel shal haue any entry into that country, straightwayes they will leaue off all their superstitions: in particular in casting of lots, which is a thing much vsed throughout all that kingdome: also this will be a great helpe thereunto, for that they are generally men of good vnderstanding, and ducible and subiect vnto reason, in so ample sort (as is declared by that religious dominicke aforesaid) he being in Canton in a temple

whereas they were sacrificing vnto their Idols, being mooued with great zeale to the honour of God, did throw certaine of them downe to the grounde. When these Idolaters did sée his boldnesse which séemed vnto them to be without reason: they laide hands on him with an infernall furie, with determination for to kill him: then he did request of them that before they did execute it, that they would heare what he would say: the which his petition séemed vnto the principals that were there to bee iust, and commanded all the people to withdrawe themselues, and to heare what he woulde say. Then he with the spirit that God did put in him, said, that they should aduertise themselues, for that God our Lorde and creator of heauen and earth, had giuen vnto them so good vnderstandings, and did equall them vnto the politikest nations in all the world: that they should not imploy it vnto euil, neither subiect themselues to worship vnto stones and blocks of wood which haue no discourse of reason, more then is giuen them by the workmen that did make them, and it were more reason the idols should reuerence &amp; worship men, because they haue their similitude &amp; likenesse: with these words and other such like in effect, they were all quieted, and did not only approoue his saying to be true, but did giue him great thankes, excusing themselues: saying, that vntill that time there was none that euer did giue them to vnderstand so much, neither how they did euill in doing their sacrifices, and in token of gratefulnes (leauing their idols on the ground, and some broken all to pieces) they did beare him company vnto his lodging. Hereby you may vnderstand with what facilitie, by the helpe of almightie God, they may be reduced vnto our catholike faith: opening (by the light of the gospel) the doore which the diuell hath kept shut by false delusions so long time, although the king with all his gouernors and ministers hath great care that in all that kingdome there be none to induce nouelties, neither to admit strangers or any new doctrin without license of the said king, &amp; of his roial counsel vpon pain of death, the which is executed with great rigor. They are people very ducible and apt to bee taught, and easie to bee turned from their idolatrie, superstition &amp; false gods: the which they haue in smal veneratiō as aforesaid. With great humility they do receiue &amp; approoue corrections of their weaknes, &amp; do know

the vauntage that is betwixt the gospell and their rites and vanities, and do receiue the same with a verie good will, as it hath béene and is séene in manie Chinos that haue receiued baptisme in the Citie of Manila, vpon one of the Ilands Philippinas, whereas they do dwell, and leaue their owne naturall countrie for to enioy that which they vnderstande to bee for the saluation of their soules. So that those who haue receiued baptisme are become verie good Christians.
               
               
                  CHAP. IIII. Of lots which they doe vse when they will doe anie thing of importance, and howe they doe inuocate or call the diuell.
                  THe people of this countrie do not alonely vse superstitions, but they are also great Augurisers or tellers of fortunes, and do beléeue in auguries, as a thing most certaine and infallible, but in especiall by certaine lots which they do vse at all times,They cast lottes. when they beginne any iorney, or for to doe any thing of importaunce, as to marie a sonne, a daughter, or lend anie money, or buy any lands, or deale wt merchandise, or any other thing whose end is incertaine or doubtfull. In all these matters they do vse lottes, the which they do make of two sticks, flat on the one side, and round on the other, and being tyed togither with a small thréede, throwe them before their Idols. But before they do throwe them, they do vse great ceremonies in talke, and vse amorous and gentle wordes, desiring them to giue them good fortune. For by them they doe vnderstand the successe to be good or euill in their iourney, or any other thing that they do take in hande. Likewise they do promise them, if they do giue them good fortune, to offer vnto them, victuales, frontalles, or some other thing of price. This being done they throwe downe their lots, and if it so fall out that the flat side be vpper, or one flat side and the other round, they haue it for an euill signe or token. Then they returne vnto their Idols, and say vnto them manie iniurious words, calling them dogs, infamous, villaines, and other names like in effect. After they haue vttered vnto them all iniuries at their pleasure, then they beginne againe to fawne vpon them, and intreat them with

milde and swéet words, crauing pardon of that which is past, and promising to giue them more gifts then before they did, if their lot do fal out wel. Then in the like manner as before, they do procéed, and throw the lots before the idols: but if it fal not out according vnto their expectation, then they returne againe with vituperous and vile words: but if to their desire, then with great praises and promises. But when that in matters of great importance, it is long before their lots do fall well: then they take them and throwe them to the grounde and treade vppon them, or else throwe them into the sea, or into the fire,They throw their gods vnder their feete. whereas they let them burne a while: and sometimes they doo whippe them vntill such time as the lottes doo fall as they woulde haue them, which is the rounde side vpwards, and is a token of good successe vnto that, for which they do cast their lottes. Then if the lottes doo fall out vnto their content, they doo make vnto them great feastes with musicke and songes of great praise, and doo offer vnto them géese, duckes, and boyled rise. But if the thing whereon they doo cast their lottes bée of importance, then they doo offer vnto them a hogges heade boyled, dressed with hearbes and flowers, the which is estéemed aboue all other thinges, and therewith a great pot with wine. Of all that they doo offer, they doo cut off their billes, and the clawes of the fowles, and the hogges snowte, and do throw vpon it graines of rise,A hogs head for a sacrifice. and sprinkling it it with wine, they set it in dishes vpon the altar, and there they do eate and drinke making great feast and chéere before their idols.
                  Another kinde of lots they doo vse,Another kind of lots. in putting a great number of little stickes into a pot, and vpon euerie one of them is written a letter: and after that they haue tumbled and tossed them together in the pot: they cause a child to put in his hand and take out one, and when they haue séene the letter, they séeke in a booke which they haue for that purpose: the leafe that beginneth with that letter, and looke what they doo finde written therein, they doo interpret of it conformable vnto the thing that they cast their lots for.
                  Generally in all this country when they finde themselues in any trouble,Inuocation to the diuell. they do inuocate and call vpon the diuell with whom they do ordinarily talke (euen as we do cal vpon God in

our néede) of him they doo demande what way and order they might take to cléere themselues thereof, as they did in the presence of frier Pedro de Alfaro, of the order of saint Francis, in the yeare of our Lorde 1580. at such time as he came from China, as may bee séene in his relation. The order that they haue in inuocating or calling on the diuell, is as followeth. They cause a man to lie vpon the ground, his face downwards then another beginneth to reade vpon a booke singing, and part of them that are present do answere vnto him: the rest do make a sound with little bels, and tabers: then within a little while after, the man that lieth on the ground, beginneth to make visages and iestures: which is a certaine token that the diuell is entred within him: then do they aske of him what they doo desire to know: then he that is possessed doth answere, yet for the most part they bee lies that hee dooth speake:The diuell telleth lies. although hee doo kéepe it close, yet doth hée giue diuers reasons vnto that which hee dooth answere, for that alwayes they doo answere either by worde or by letters, which is the remedie they haue, when that the diuell will not answere by worde. And when that hée doth answere by letters, then do they spread a redde mantle or couerlet vpon the ground, and throw thereon a certaine quantitie of rice dispersed equally in euery place vpon the couerlet: then do they cause a man that cannot write to stand there with a sticke in his hand, then those that are present do begin to sing and to make a sounde as at the first inuocation: and within a little while the diuell doth enter into him that hath the sticke, and causeth him to write vpon the rice, then do they translate the letters that are there formed with the sticke, and being ioyned altogether, they finde answere of that they do demaunde: although for the most part it falleth out as aforesaide, as vnto people that do communicate with the father of all lying, and so do their answeares fall out false and full of leasings. If that at any time he do tell them the trueth, it is not for that he dooth it by nature or with his will: but to induce them vnder the colour of a truth to perseuer in their errors, and they do giue credite vnto a thousand lies: in this sort doo they inuocate the diuell, and it is so ordinarie a thing throughout al the kingdome, that there is nothing more vsed nor knowne.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP V. Of the opinion they haue of the beginning of the worlde, and of the creation of man.
                  ALthough the Chinos be generally verie ingenious, and of a cléere vnderstanding, yet in their owne respect, they say that all other nations in the worlde be blinde, except the Spaniards whom they haue knowne but of late time: they haue amongst them both naturall and morall philosophie, the which is read publikely amongst them, and also astrologie.
                  But nowe touching the beginning of the worlde, and the creation of man: they haue many errors, wherof some of them shalbe declared in this chapter, taken out of their owne books, and specially out of one that is intituled the beginning of the world.
                  They say that at the beginning, the heauen, the earth, &amp; the water were a masse or lumpe ioyned in one. And that there is one resident in heauen, whom they call by name Tayn, hee by his great science did separate heauen and earth, the one from the other, so that the heauen remained hie in the state that it is, and the earth following his naturall inclination, as graue and heauie, did remaine whereas it is. They say that this Tayn did create a man of nothing, who they call Pauzon,
                     Strange opinions. and likewise a woman, who they call Pauzona. This Pauzon by the power that was giuē him by Tayn, did create of nothing another man who they call Tanhom, with thirtéene other brothers. This Tanhom was a man of great science, in so ample sort, that hée did giue name vnto all created things, and did know by the assignement and doctrine of Tayn, the vertue of them all, and to apply them to heale all manner of diseases and sicknesses: this Tanhom and his brethren, but especially the eldest, who was called Teyencom, he had twelue: his first begotten, called Tuhucom had nine, so had al the rest very many. They do beléeue that the linage and generation of these did indure for more then ninty thousand yéeres. And in the end &amp; conclusion of them, did end all humaine nature: for that it was the will of Tayn, who did first create the man &amp; woman of nothing, for to be reuenged on certaine iniuries that they did vnto him, and for euery one that he had shewed vnto them, they did almost knowe so much

as himselfe, and would not acknowledge any superioritie, as they did promise him, at such time as hée did giue vnto him the secreat of all his science. At that time did the heauen fall downe, then did Tayn raise it vp againe, and created another man vpon the earth named Lotzitzam, hee had two hornes, out of the which proceeded a verie swéete sauour: the which swéet smell did bring forth both men and women. This Lotzitzam vanished away,Marueilous barieties. and left behind him in the world manie men and women, of whom did procéede all nations that now are in it. The first that this Lotzitzam brought foorth was called Alazan, and liued nine hundred yeares: then did the heauen create another man called Atzion, whose mother called Lutim was with childe with him, onely in séeing a lyons heade in the aire: he was borne in Truchin in the prouince of Santon, and liued eight hundred yeares: at this time was the worlde replenished with much people, and did féede on nothing but on wilde hearbs and raw things: then was there borne into the worlde one called Vsao, who gaue them industrie to make and do many things, as to vse the trées to make defence to saue them from wilde beasts, which did them much harme, and to kill them, and make garments of their skinnes. After him came one called Huntzui,
                     The first inuention of 
                           ••
                        re. who did inuent the vse of fire, and instructed them what they should doo, and how to rost and boyle their victuals, and howe to barter and sell one thing for another. They did vnderstande one another in their contradictions by knots made vpon cords, for that they had not the vse of letters nor any mention thereof. After that they say, that a certaine woman, called Hantzibon was deliuered of a son named Ocheutey, who was the inuentor of many things &amp; ordained mariage, &amp; to play on many &amp; diuers instruments. They do affirme that he came from heauen by myracle for to do good vpon the earth:Strange opinions. for that his mother going by the way did sée the print of a mans foote, &amp; putting her foote on it, she was straight wayes inuironed with a lightning, with whom she was conceiued, and with child with this son. This Ocheutey had a son called Ezoulom who was the inuenter of phisicke &amp; astrology, but in especiall matters touching lawe and iudgement.The inuention of plough and spade▪
                      Hée shewed them howe to till the lande, and inuented the plough and spade: of this man they doo tell manie woonderfull and

maruellous things, but amongst them all, they say that he did eate of seuen seuerall kindes of hearbes that were poyson, and did him no harme: he liued 400. hundred yeares: his son was called Vitey, the first king they had amongst them,The first king of China.
                      hée reduced all things to be vnder gouernement, and to haue it by succession, as shalbe declared in the chapter, whereas I will treate of the king of this mightie kingdome that now liueth. These and many other varieties and toyes they saie of the beginning of the world: whereby may be vnderstood, how little men may do without the fauour of God, and the light of the catholike faith, yea though they be of the most subtilest and finest wit that may be immagined.
               
               
                  CHAP VI. How they hold for a certaintie, that the soule is immotall, and that he shal haue another life: in the which it shalbe punished or rewarded according vnto the workes which he doth in this world, and how they pray for the dead.
                  BY that aforesaid, it appeareth to be of a truth that the apostle S. Thomas did preach in China, &amp; we may presume that all which wee haue séene dooth remaine printed in their hearts from his doctrine, and beareth a similitude of the truth, &amp; a conformity with the things of our catholike religion. Now touching this that wee will treate of in this chapter, of the immortalitie that they beléeue of the soule, and of the rewarde or punishment which they shall haue in the other life, according vnto the workes doone in company with the bodie: which appeareth to be the occasion that they do not liue so euill as they might, not hauing the knowledge of this truth.
                  I do hope by the power of his deuine maiestie, that they wil easilie be brought vnto the true knowledge of the gospel. They say and doo affirme it of a truth,The soule is immortall. that the soule had his first beginning from the heauen, and shall neuer haue ende: for that the heauen hath giuen it an eternall essence. And for the time that it is within the body that God hath ordeined, if it do liue according to such lawes as they haue without doing euill, or deceit vnto his neighbor: thē it shalbe caried vnto heauē, wheras it shal liue eternally with great ioy, &amp; shalbe made an angel: &amp;

to the contrarie, if it liue ill, shall go with the diuels into darke dungeons and prisons, whereas they shall suffer with them torments which neuer shall haue end. They doo confesse, that there is a place whither such soules as shalbe made angels doo go to make themselues cleane of al such euil as did cleaue vnto them, being in the bodie: and for that it should be spéedelier doone, the good déeds which are done by their parents &amp; friends doo helpe them verie much. So that it is very much vsed throughout al the kingdome to make orations, &amp; praiers for the dead, for the which they haue a day appointed in the moneth of August. They do not make their offrings in their temples, but in their houses: the which they doo in this manner following. The day appointed, all such as do beare them companie vntill their sacrifices are concluded for the dead: which are such as we do cal here religious men, euery one hath his companion and walketh the stréets, and dooth report the daies &amp; houses where they will be, for that it cannot be doone altogether. So when they come vnto the house whereas they must doo their offices: they enter in, &amp; do prepare that euery one do make oration and sacrifice according to their fashion for the dead of that house: vnderstanding that by their helpe they shalbe made cleane from their euils, which is an impediment that they cannot be angels nor inioy the benefite which is ordained for them in heauen. One of these that is like vnto a priest, dooth bring with him a taber, &amp; other two little bords, &amp; another a little bell. Thē they do make an altar,Strange ob sequies. wheron they do set such idols as the dead had for their saints liuing: then do they perfume them with frankē
                     sence and storax, and other swéet smels: then do they put 5. or 6 tables ful of victuals for the dead &amp; for the saints: then straightwayes at the sound of the taber, little bords &amp; bels (which is a thing more apt for to dance by, as by report of them that haue heard it) they begin to sing certaine songs which they haue for that purpose, then doe the nouices goe vp vnto the altar, and do offer in written paper those Orations which they did sing to the sound of those instruments, This being done, they sit down and begin anew to sing as before.They make their sacrifices in the night. In the end of their prayers and songs, he who doth this office, doth sing a prayer, and in the end thereof (with a litle borde that he hath in his hand for the purpose) he striketh a blow vpon the table, then the other

do answere in the same tune, declining their heades, &amp; doe take certaine painted papers, and guilt papers, and doe burne them before the altar. In this sort they are all the night, which is the time that ordinarily they do make their sacrifices: the which being done, the priests &amp; those that be in the house, do eat the victuals that was set vpon the tables, wherein they doo spend the residue of the night till it be day. They say that in doing this they do purifie and make cleane the soules that they may goe &amp; become angels.Great superstition. The commō people do beléeue of truth that the soule that liueth not well, before they go into hell (which shall not be before the end of the world, according as they do thinke in their error) in recompence of their euill life, the heauens doo put them into the bodies of buffes and other beasts: and those which liue well, into the bodies of kings &amp; lords, whereas they are very much made of &amp; well serued. These and a thousande toies in like sort, making that the soule dooth mooue out of one into another, as certaine old philosophers did affirme it to bee, who were as blind and as far from the truth as they.
               
               
                  CHAP. VII. Of their temples, and of certaine manner of religious people both men and women, and of their superiours.
                  THere are found in this kingdome many moral things, the which do touch verie much our religion, which giueth vs to vnderstand that they are people of great vnderstanding, in especial in naturall things, and that it should be of a certainty, that the holy apostle of whom we haue spoken, did leaue amongst them by his preachings occasion for to learne manie things that do shew vnto vertue: one of the which is, that there is found amongst them many monasteries, in their cities and townes, and also in the fieldes, wherein are manie men and women that do liue in great closenes, and obedience: after the fashiō of other religious monasteries. They haue amongst thē (that is knowne) onely foure orders, euery one of thē hath their generall, who dwelleth ordinarily in the citie of Suntien, or Taybin, wheras is the king &amp; his counsel. These their generals they doo call in their language Tricon, who doo prouide for euery prouince a prouinciall to assist &amp; visite all the conuents,

correcting and amending such faults as is found, according vnto the institution and manner of liuing. This prouinciall doth ordaine in euery conuent one, which is like vnto the prior or guardian whom al the rest do reuerence and obey. This generall is for euer till he doo die, except they doo finde in him such faults that he doth deserue to be depriued: yet they do not elect their prouincials as we do vse, but it is doone by the king &amp; his counsell, alwayes choosing 
                        〈◊〉
                      that is knowne to be of a good life and fame: so that fauour carrieth nothing away. This generall is apparelled all in silke,Gallant colours for religious men. in that colour that his profession dooth vse: either blacke, yeallow, white or russet, which are the fower colours that the foure orders doo vse: hee neuer goeth foorth of his house, but is carried in a little chaire of Iuorie or golde, by foure or sixe men of his habite. When any of the conuent doth talke vnto him, it is on their knées: they haue also amongst them a seale of their monasterie, for the dispatching of such businesse as toucheth their religion. These haue great rentes giuen them by the king for the sustayning of themselues and their seruants. All their conuents hath great rentes in general: part giuen them by the king, and part of charitie, giuen them in those cities or townes whereas they haue their houses, the which are many and verie huge. They doo aske their charitie in the stréets, singing with the sounde of two little 
                        •
                     ords, and other instruments. Euery one of them when they do begge, doth carrie in their hands a thing, wherin are written certaine praiers, that they say is for the sins of the people: and all that is giuen them in charitie they lay it vpon the said thing, wherewith they do vnderstand (in their blinde opinion) that their spirit is cleare of all sinne. In general their beards and heads are shauen, and they weare one sole vesture, without making any difference, according vnto the colour of their religion. They do eate altogether, &amp; haue their sels according to the vse of our friers, their vestures or apparel is ordinary of serge of the saide foure colours. They haue beads to pray on as the papists vse, although in another order: they doe assist al burials for to haue charity: they do arise two houres before day to pray, as our papists do their mattins, and do continue in the same vntill the day doo breake: they doo praie all in one voice, singing in verie good order and attention, and all the

time of their praying they do ring belles, whereof they haue in that kingdome the best and of the gallantest sounde that is in all the world, by reason that they are made almost all of stéele,Gallant bels. they pray vnto the heauen, whom they take for their God, and vnto Sinquian, who they say was the inuenter of that their manner of life, and became a saint. They may leaue their order at all times at their pleasure, giuing their generall to vnderstand thereof.
                  But in the time that they are in that order they cannot marrye, neither deale with anye women vpon paine to bee punished asperly. At such time as one doth put himselfe in religion, the father or next kinsman of him that taketh the order, doth inuite all them of the conuent, and doth make them a great and solemne banket, yet you must vnderstand that the eldest sonne of any man cannot put himself in any monasterie, but is prohibited by the lawes of the countrie,The eldest sonne is prohibited to take orders. for that the eldest sonne is bound to sustaine his father in his olde age. When that any of these religious men do die, they doe wash him, and shaue him, before they do burie him, &amp; do all weare mourning apparell for him. The religious man or woman, that is once punished for any fault, cannot afterward turne and receiue the habite at any time. They haue a certaine marke giuen vnto them in token of their fault, and that is a bord
                        •
                      put about their necke, so that it is séene of all people. Euerie morning and euening they do offer vnto their Idolles, frankensence, beniamin, wood of aguila and cayolaque the which is maruelous swéete, and other gummes of swéet and odoriferous smels. When that they will lanch any ship into the water, after that it is made, then these religious men, all apparelled with rich roabes of silke, do go to make sacrifices vpon the poopes of them, wheras they haue their oratories, and there they doe offer painted papers of diuers figures, the which they doe cut in peeces before their idols, with certaine ceremonies and songes well consorted, and ringing of little belles, they do reuerence vnto the diuell. And they do paint him in the fore castle, for that he shall do no harme vnto the ships: that being done, they do eate and drinke till they can no more. And with this they thinke it is sufficient for the shippe, that all such viages as shee shall make shall succéede well, the which they haue amongst them for a

thing most certaine: and if they did not blesse them in this order, all things would fall out to the contrarie.
               
               
                  CHAP. VIII. The order that they haue in burying of the dead, and the mourning apparell they haue.
                  IT séemeth vnto me not farre from our purpose, to declare in this place, how they vse in this kingdome to burie the dead, &amp; it is surely a thing to be noted: the maner is as foloweth. Whē that any one doth die, at the very instant yt he yéeldeth vp ye gost, they do wash his bodie all ouer from top to toe,A straung kindof buriall. then do they apparell him with the best apparell that he had, all perfumed with swéet smels. Thē after he is apparelled, they do set him in ye best chaier that he hath, then cōmeth vnto him his father &amp; mother, brethren &amp; sisters, &amp; children, who knéeling before him, they do take their leaue of him, shedding of many teares, &amp; making of great moane euery one of thē by themselues. Then after them in order commeth all his kinsfolkes &amp; friends, and last of all his seruants (if 
                        •
                     e had any,) who in like case do as the other before. This being done, they do put him into a coffin or chest made of verie swéete wood, (in that countrie you haue verie much) they do make it very close, to auoid the euil smel. Then do they put him on a table with two bankes, in a chamber verie gallantly dressed and hanged with the best clothes that can be gotten, couering him with a white shéete hanging downe to the ground, whereon is painted the dead man or woman, as naturall as possible may be. But first in the chamber whereas the bead bodie is or at the entrie, they set a table with candles on it, and full of bread &amp; fruits of diuers sorts. And in this order they kéepe him aboue ground 15. daies, in yt which time euery night commeth thether their priests &amp; religious men, whereas they sing praiers and offer sacrifices, with other ceremonies: they bring with them many painted papers, and do burne them in the presence of the dead bodie, with a thousand superstitions &amp; witchcraftes: &amp; they do hang vpon cordes (which they haue for the same purpose) of the same papers before him, &amp; many times do shake them &amp; make a great noyse, with the which they say it doth send the soule straight vnto heauen. In the end of the 15.

daies, all which time the tables are continually furnished with victuals &amp; wine, which the priests, their kinsfolkes and friends, that do come to visite thē do eat. These ceremonies being ended, they take the coffin with the dead bodie, &amp; carrie him into the fields, accompanied with all his kinsfolks &amp; friends, &amp; with their priests &amp; religious men carrying candles in their hands, wheras ordinarily they do burie thē on a mountaine, in sepultures that for the same purpose in their life time they caused to be made of stone &amp; masons worke: that being doone, straight waies ha
                        •
                     d by ye sepulture, they do plant a pine trée, in ye which place there be many of them, &amp; they be neuer cut downe except they be ouerthrowne with the weather, &amp; after they be fallen they let them lie till they consume of thēselues, for that they be sanctified. The people yt do beare him company to the graue, do go in very good order like a procession, &amp; haue with them many instruments, which neuer leaue playing till such time as the dead is put into the sepulcher. And that burial which hath most priests &amp; musicke is most sumptuous, wherin they were woont to spend great riches. They sing to the sound of the instrumēts many orations vnto their Idols: and in the end they do burne vpon the sepulcher many papers, whereon is painted, slaues, horse, gold, siluer, silkes, &amp; many other things, the which they say, that the dead body doth possesse in the other world whether he goeth to dwell. At such time as they do put him into ye graue, they doe make great bankets &amp; sports with great pastime, saying of a truth, that looke what soeuer they do at that time, the angels &amp; saints that are in heauen doe the like vnto the soule of the dead that is there buried. Their parents, familiars and seruants, in all this time doo weare mourning apparell, the which is verie asper, for that their apparell is made of a verie course wolle, &amp; weare it next vnto their skins, &amp; girt vnto them with cords, and on their heads bunnets of the same cloth, with verges brode like vnto a hat hanging downe to their eyes: for father or mother they do weare it a hole yeare, and some two yeares, &amp; if his son be a gouernor (with licence of the king) he doth withdraw himself many times, leauing the office he hath, the which they estéeme a great point of honor, &amp; haue it in grea
                        •
                      account, and such as are not so much in aliance do apparell thē in died linnen certaine monethes. Likewise their parents and

friendes, although these doo weare it but for the time of the buriall.
               
               
                  CHAP. IX. Of their ceremonies that they vse in the celebrating the marriages.
                  THe people of this kingdome haue a particular care to giue state vnto their children in time, before that they be ouercome or drowned in vices or lasciuious liuing. The which care is the occasion, that in this countrie being so great, there is lesse vice vsed than in any other smaller countries: whose ouer much care doth cause them many times to procure to marrie their children being verie yoong: yea and to make consort before they bee borne with signes &amp; tokens, making their writings and bandes for the performance of the same in publike order. In all this kingdome, yea and in the Ilands Philippinas, it is a customable vse, that the husband doth giue dowrie vnto the wife with whom he doth marrie, and at such time as they doe ioyne in matrimonie, the father of the bride doth make a great feast in his owne house, and doth inuite to the same, the father and mother, kinsfolkes and friends of his sonne in lawe. And the next day following, the father of the bridegrome, or his next parent, doth the like vnto the kinsfolkes of the bride. These bankets being finished, the husbande doth giue vnto his wife her dowrie in the presence of them all, and she doth giue it vnto her father or mother (if she haue them) for the paines they tooke in the bringing her vp. Whereby it is to be vnderstoode, that in this kingdome, and in those that doe confine on it,They that haue most daughters are most richest. those that haue most daughters are most richest, so that with the dowries their daughters do giue them, they may well sustaine themselues in their necessitie, and when they die, they doo giue it that daughter that did giue it them, that it may remaine for their children, or otherwise vse it at their willes. A man may marrie with so manie wiues as he can sustaine, so it be not with his sister or brothers daughter,They may marrie with many wiues. and if any doo marrie in these two degrées, they are punished very rigorously. Of all their wiues, the first is their legitimate wife, and all the rest are accompted but as lemanes or concubines. These married

men, doo liue and kéepe house with his first wife, and the rest he doth put in other houses, or if he be a merchant, then he doth repart them in such villages or townes, whereas hee doth deale in, who are vnto him as seruantes in respect of the first. When the father doth die, the eldest sonne by his first wife doth inherite the most part of all his goods, and the rest is reparted in equall partes amongest the other children, both of his first wife and of all the other wiues. For lacke of a sonne by his first wife, the first borne of the other wiues doth inherite the most part: so that fewe times or neuer there is none that dieth without heyres, eyther by his first wife, or by the others. And if it so fall out that any of these his wiues do commit adulterie (the which seeldome chaunceth, by reason of their kéeping in, and great honestie,Honest women. as also it is great infamie vnto the man that doth offer any such thing) then may the husband finding them togither, kill them: but after that first furie being past, he cannot but complaine of the adulterers vnto the Iustice, and although it be prooued verie apparant, yet can they giue them no more punishment but beate them cruelly vppon their thyghes, as is the custome and lawe of the countrie, as shalbe declared vnto you in his place. Then may the husband afterwardes sell his wife for a 
                        •
                     laue, and make money of her for the dowrie he gaue her: notwithstanding, there be amongst them that for interest will dissemble the matter, yea and will séeke oportunities and occasion. Yet if such be spied or knowen they are righteously punished. They say in the prouinces that be néere vnto Tartaria, and in the selfe same Tartaria they doo vse a custome and manner of marriage very strange, that is: the vizroyes or gouernors doo limit and appoint a time when that all men and women shall méete together such as will marie, or receiue the order of religion.
                  The time being accomplished, all such as would be married do méete together in a citie of that prouince appointed for that purpose: and when they come thether, they doo present themselues before 12. auncient and principall men appointed there by the king for the same purpose, who doo take a note of their names both of men and women and of what state and degrée they are,A straung kind of marriage. and of their substance for to dowrie their wiues with whom they shalbe married. Then do they number all the men

and women that be there, &amp; if they do find more men than women, or to the contrarie, more womē than men: then they cast lots, &amp; do leaue the number that doth so beare in register til the next yeare, yt they may be the first that shalbe married. Then sixe of those ancient men, do put the men in thrée parts, the rich they put in one part without any consideration of gentilitie or beautie, and those that are rich in a meane, in an other parte, and the poore in the thirde part. In the meane time that these sixe men be occupied in the reparting of the men, the other▪ sixe doe repart the women in thrée parts, to say in this manner, the most fairest in one part, and them not so faire in an other, and the fowlest in an other. This diuision being made, thē do they marrie them in this order: vnto the riche men they doo giue the fairest, and they doo giue for them the prise that is appointed by the Iudges, and vnto them that are not so rich they do giue them that are not so faire, without paying for them anye thing at all: and vnto the poore men they giue the fowlest, with all that which the rich men do pay for the faire women, diuiding it into equall partes. Sure it is a notable thing if it bee true. This being done, they are all married in one daie, and holpen (although peraduenture not all content) the marriages being doone there is great feastes made, in such houses as the king hath ordeyned in euerye citie for the same purpose, the which are furnished with beds, and all other necessaries belonging thereunto, for that the new married people may be serued of all that is néedfull for the time that the feast do indure. This solemnitie beeing finished, which they saye doth indure fiftie dayes: these newe married people doo goe vnto their owne houses. You must vnderstande that this custome of marriage is ordeyned for the cōmon and poore people, and not for Lords nor gentlemen, who are not bound to obey this ordinaunce, but to marrie whereas they like best, euerie one to séeke and marrie with his equall, or else by an order which the king hath set downe vnto the viceroyes and gouernors, what to be done therein.
                  When that the king of China is married, then dooth hee choose thirtie concubines, the principallest persons in all his kingdome, the which hee dooth kéepe and maintayne within his pallace so long as hee doth liue. But after that hee is

dead and his funerall ended, as is accustomed: then doth the heire or successor of the kingdome apparell these thirtie women maruelous gorgeously with many iewelles, then doth hee cause them to set in an Estrado, or rich pallet gallantly dressed and furnished in one of the thrée halles (as shall be declared in the second chapter of the third booke) with their faces couered, in such sort as they may not be séene nor knowen: and being set in this order, then doth there enter in thirtie gentlemen of the principallest of the kingdome, (those whom the king left named in his testamēt) the which goeth by antiquitie, or according vnto order set by the king: and eyther of them doth take one of these Ladies by the hand, and looke howe they found thē, so they doo carrie them with their faces couered till they bring them home to their houses, whereas they haue them for their wiues, and do maintaine and kéepe them all the dayes of their liues: towards the mainteyning of them the king doth leaue in his testament great reueneues, and the successor in the kingdome doth accomplish and performe the same with great diligence and care. In old time when that the kinges of China would marrie anie of his children or kinsfolkes, he did make in his pallace a great and solemne banket, to the which he did inuite all the principallest Lordes and gentlemen of his court, commaunding to bring with them their sonnes and daughters, who did accomplish the same, striuing who should apparell their children most richest and most gallantest. The banket being done, the young princes do go whereas are these young Ladies, euerie one placed in order according to their age, and there he doth chuse his wife according to his owne will or desire, and where he liketh best. Likewise the infants or kings daughters doe the like in choosing their husbands amongst the young lords and gentlemen. But at this time, this custome is left off, for that the princes and gentlemen do marry with their kinsfolkes, so that it be not in the first or seconde degrée: yet many times they do not kéepe the second.
               
               
                  CHAP. X. How that in all this mightie kingdome there is no poore folks walking in the streets nor in the tēples a begging, &amp;

the order that the king hath giuen for the maintayning of them that cannot worke.
                  MAnie things of great gouernment hath béene and shall be declared in this historie worthie to be considered: and in my opinion, this is not the least that is contayned in this chapter, which is such order as the king and his counsell hath giuen that the poore may not go a begging in the stréetes, nor in the temples whereas they make orations vnto their Idols: for the auoyding therof the king hath set downe an order,A good order to auoid idle people. vpon great and gréeuous penaltie to be executed vpon the saide poore, if they do begge or craue in the stréetes, and a greater penaltie vpon the citizens or townes men, if they do giue vnto any such that beggeth, but must incontinent go and complaine on them to the Iustice: who is one that is called the Iustice of the poore ordayned to punish such as doo breake the lawe, and is one of the principallest of the citie or towne, and hath no other charge but only this. And for that the townes be great and many and so full of people, and an infinite nomber of villages, whereas it cannot be chosen but there is many borne lame, and other misfortunes, so that he is not idle but alwaies occupied in giuing order to remedie the necessities of the poore without breaking of the lawe. This Iudge the first day that hee doth enter into his office,I would the like were with vs. hee commaundeth that whatsoeuer children be borne a créeple in any part of his members, or by sicknes be taken lame, or by any other misfortune, that incontinent their fathers or mothers doo giue the Iudge to vnderstande thereof that he may prouide for all things necessarie, according vnto the ordinance and will of the king and his counsell, the which is, the man child or woman child, being brought before him, and seene the default or lacke that it hath, if it be so that with the same it may exercise any occupation, they giue and limit a time vnto the parents, for to teach the child that occupation ordayned by the Iudge, and it is such, as with their lamenes they may vse without any impediment, the which is accomplished without faile: but if it so be that his lamenes is such, that it is impossible to learne or exercise any occupation, this Iudge of the poore doth commaund the father to sustaine and maintaine him in his owne house all the dayes of his life, if that hee hath

wherewithall: if not, or that hee is fatherlesse, then the next rich kinsman must maintaine it: if he hath none such, then doth all his parents and kinsfolkes contribute and pay their partes, or giue of such thinges as they haue in their houses. But if it hath no parentes, or they be so poore, that they cannot contribute nor supply any part therof: then doth the king maintaine them in verie ample manner of his owne costes in hospitalles, verie sumptuous, that he hath in euerie citie throughout his kingdome for the same effect and purpose: in the same hospitalles are likewise maintayned, all such néedie and olde men,A very good order. as haue spent all their youth in the wars, and are not able to maintaine themselues: so that to the one and the other is ministred all that is néedefull and necessarie, and that with great diligence and care: and for the better accomplishing of the same, the Iudge doth put verie good order, and dooth appoint one of the principallest of the citie or towne, to be the administrator, without whose licence. There is not one within that hospitall that can goe foorth of the limittes: for that licence is not granted vnto anie, neyther doo they demaund it, for that there they are prouided of all thinges necessarie so long as they doo liue, as well for apparell as for victualles. Besides all this, the olde folkes and poore men within the hospitall, doo bring vpp hennes, chickens, and hogges for their owne recreation and profit, wherein they doo delight themselues. The Iudge doth visite often times the administrator by him appointed. Likewise the Iudge is visited by an other that commeth from the court, by the appointment of the king and the counsell to the same effect: and to visite all such hospitalles as bee in the prouinces limited in his commission, and if they doo finde any that hath not executed his office in right and iustice, then they doo displace them,A mirror for vs to looke vpon. and punishe them verie rigorouslie: by reason whereof all such officers haue great care of their charges and liue vprightly, hauing before their eyes the straight account which they must giue, and the cruell rewarde if to the contrarie. The blinde folkes in this countrie are not accounted in the number of those that of necessitie are to bee maintayned by their kinsfolkes, or by the king: for they are constrayned to worke, as to grind with a querne wheate or rice, or to blowe smythes bellowes, or

such like occupations, that they haue no néede of their sight. And if it be a blind woman, when the commeth vnto age, she doth vse the office of women of loue, of which sor
                        •
                     e there are a great number in publike places, as shall bee declared in the Chapter for that purpose. These haue women that doo tende vpon them, and doo paint and trim them vp, and they are such that with pure age did leaue that office. So by this order in all this kingdome, although it be great, and the people infinite: yet there is no poore that doo perish nor begge in the stréetes, as was apparant vnto the austen and barefoote fryers, and the rest that went with them into that countrie.

                     IN the fourth Chapter of the first booke, I did promise, particularly to declare, howe many kinges haue béene in this kingdome, and their names. Nowe to accomplish the same, I will beginne and declare the succession of them from Vitey,
                     
                        Vitey the first king of China.
                      (who was the first that did reduce the kingdome to one empire gouernment) vnto him that dooth reigne at this daye, remitting that which shall lacke vnto the Chapter aforesaide: whereas shall be found the number of the kinges, and how many yeares since the first beginning of this kingdome, and the manner of the succession.
                  This Vitey was the first king of China (as it appeareth by their histories, where as they doo make particular mention.) But amongest other thinges that they do declare of the kinges person, they do say that he was in height so much as seuen mesures, which is accustomed in China: and euerie measure is

two thirdes of a Spanish vare,Which is foure yeardes quarter and halfe. which is by good account foure vares and two terses in length: he was sixe palmes broade in the shoulders, and was as valiant in his déedes as in bignesse of his bodie: he had a Captaine called Lincheon, who was not onely valiant, but politike and of great wisedome, by reason whereof with his valour and strength he did subiect vnto Vitey, all the whole countrie that he doth nowe possesse, and caused all people to feare him. They do attribute that this Vitey, did first inuent the vse of garmentes for to weare,The first inuention of garments and dying o
                           •
                         colours. and the dying of all manner of colours, of making of shippes: hee likewise inuented the saw
                        •
                      to sawe tymber, but aboue all thinges he was a great Architector, and an inuenter of buildinges, whereof hee made verie manie and verie sumptuous, which doo indure vnto this day in the remembraunce of his name: he did also inuent the whéele to turne silke, the which is vsed to this day in all the kingdome: hee was the first that did vse to weare golde, pearles and precious stones for iewelles, and to weare cloth of golde, siluer and silke in apparell: he did repart all the people of the countrie into cities, townes and villages: and did ordaine occupations, and commaunded that no man should vse any other but that which his father did vse, without his particular licence, or the gouerners of his kingdome. And that shuld not be granted without great occasion for the same.
                  All of one occupation were put in stréetes by themselues, the which order is vsed vnto this day throughout al the kingdome: so that if you doo desire to knowe what occupation is in anye stréete, it is sufficient to sée the first house thereof, although it be very long: for it is verie certaine that they be all of one occupation and not mingled with any other. Amongst all other things he ordeyned one thing of great consideration, that was,No women to be idle. no woman to be idle but to worke, either in her husbands occupation, or in sowing or spinning. This was a law so generall amongst them, that the Quéene her selfe did obserue &amp; kéepe it.
                  They saye that he was a great Astrologician, and had growing in the court of his pallace a certaine hearbe, the which did make a manner of demonstration when that any did passe by it,A strange kind of h
                           ••
                        rb. whereby it did shewe if any were euill intentioned against the king. Many other things they do declare which I let passe because I would not be tedious vnto the reader, referring

the dreames and fondnesse of these Idolaters, vnto the iudgement of your discretion: for vnto the discréete is sufficient to touch of euerie thing a little. Hee had foure wiues, and by them fiue and twentie sonnes, he reygned a hundreth yeares: there was betwixt this king, and he which did build the great wall (that was spoken of in the ninth chapter of the first booke) one hundreth and sixtéene kinges, all of the lynage of this Vitey. All the which did raigne, as appeareth by their histories, two thousande two hundreth and fiftie seuen yeares. I do not here declare their names, because I would not be tedious, although they be particularly named in their histories: but here I will set downe them that I finde necessarie to bee spoken of for the succession vnto him that nowe reygneth. The last king of the lynage of this woorthie Vitey, was called Tzintzon: this did make the mightie and great wall aforesaide: finding himselfe to be greatly troubled with the king of Tartarie, who did make warre vppon him in many places of his kingdome: he did ordaine the making thereof, and for the furnishing of the same, he did take the third man of the countrie to the worke: and for that manie people did die in this tedious worke, by reason they went so farre from their owne houses, and in diuers climes cleane contrarie vnto that where as they were bred and borne: it grew that the king was hated and abhorred of all people, in such sort that they did conspire his death, which in effect they did accomplish and slew him, after he had reigned fortie yeares: and also his sonne and heyre who was called Aguizi. After the death of this Tzintzon and his sonne, they did ordaine for their king, one that was called Auchosau, a man of great valour and wisedome, hee reigned twelue yeares: a sonne of his did succéede him in the kingdom, called Futey, &amp; he reigned seuen yeares. After the death of this king, who died very young: his wife did reigne and gouerne, and was of his owne linage: she did maruelously gouerne that kingdome for the space of 18▪ yeares, and for that shee had no issue naturall of her bodie, a sonne of her husbands yt he had by an other wife did succéede in the kingdome, and reigned thrée and twentie yeares: a son of his did succéede him, called Cuntey, and reigned 16. yeares &amp; eight monthes: a son of his called Guntey, did reigne 54. yeares: a sonne of his did succéede him

called Guntey, and reigned thirtéene yeares: his sonne called Ochantey, did succéede him and reigned 25. yeares and thrée monthes: his son called Coantey succéeded him &amp; reigned 13. yeares &amp; two monthes. After him reigned his sonne Tzentzey, 26. yeares &amp; 4. monthes: then succéeded his son called Anthey, and reigned no more but 6. yeares, his sonne Pintatey, did inherite &amp; reigned 5. yeares: this Pintatey when he died was not married, and therefore a brother of his did succéede him called Tzintzumy, &amp; reigned but 3. yeares &amp; 7. monethes: after him succéeded a younger brother called Huy hannon, &amp; reigned sixe yeares: his sonne called Cubum did succéede him &amp; reigned 32. yeares: his son Bemthey, did inherite &amp; reigned 18. yeares: after him his son Vnthey, &amp; reigned 13. yeares: O they succéede him &amp; reigned 17. yeres, his sonne called Yanthey reigned but 8. monethes, and left a sonne called Antey, who reigned 19. yeares, whose eldest sonne called Tantey, died incontinent after his father, and reigned only 3. monthes, &amp; his brother called Chytey reigned one yeare, his son called Linthey reigned 22. yeares, his sonne called Yanthey did succeede him, &amp; reigned 31. yeares. This Yanthey (the historie saieth) was a man of small wisedome which was the occasion that he was abhorred and hated of those of his kingdome. A Nephew of his called Laupy did rebell against him, he had two sociates for to helpe him, gentlemen of the court, they were two brethren &amp; verie valiant, the one was called Quathy, the other Tzunthey, these two did procure to make Laupy king. His vncle the king vnderstoode thereof, and was of so litle valor &amp; discretion, that he could not, neither durst he put remedie in the same: which caused commotions and common rumors amongst the people. But in especiall there was foure tyrantes ioyned in one, and all at one time, they wer called, Cincoan, Sosoc, Guansian &amp; Guanser. Against these Laupy did make warre vnder colour to helpe his vncle, but after a while, that the warre indured, he concluded and made peace with Cincoan, and he married▪ with one of his daughters, who straight wayes made warre against the other thrée tyrants with the helpe of his father in lawe. At this time this mightie kingdome was diuided in thrée partes and beganne the tyrannie as you shall vnderstande: the one and principall part fell vnto Laupy by the death of his vncle,

the other to Sosoc, &amp; the other vnto Cincoan his father in law. In this sort remained the kingdome in diuision a while, til such time as Cuythey sonne vnto Laupy did reigne in his fathers stéede. Then did there a tyrant rise vp against him called Chimbutey and slew him: he by his great valour did bring the kingdome all in one as before, after that it had bin in diuision 41. yeares, and reigned after that alone 25. yeares: his sonne named Fontey, did succéede him and reigned 17. yeares. And to make short of this linage, there was 15. kinges, and reigned 176. yeares, against the last of them who was called Quioutey
                     ▪ there did arise against him tyrannously Tzobu. Of this linage▪ there was eyght kinges, who reigned 62. yeares: against the last of them called Sutey, there arose one called Cotey, of whose lynage there was fiue kings, and reigned twentie foure yeres, the last of them called Otey, was slaine by Dian
                     ▪ There was of this lynage foure kings that reigned 56. yeres: against the last of them rose vp Tym, and there was of his race, fiue kinges: and reigned one and 30. yeares: against the last of this house rose vp Tzuyn. And there was of this linage thrée kings, and reigned seuen and thirtie yeares, against the last of these rose vp Touco. This and all the rest of his lynage did gouerne maruelous well: which was the occasion that they endured the longer time. There was of them one and twentie kinges, and reigned 294. yeares: the last of them called Troncon, did marrie with one that had béene his fathers wife, called Bausa
                     ▪ a verie faire woman: hee tooke her out of a monasterie where she was a Nunne, onely to marrie with her: she vsed such policie that he was slaine, and did gouerne the kingdome after alone one and fortie yeares. The historie sayth that she was dishonest, and that with extremitie, and vsed the companie of the best and principallest of the realme, and not content with that, she married with one of base lynage, one fit for her purpose, because she was so vicious. They say that before she did marrie, she caused to be slaine the sonnes she had by her first husbande, for that she had a desire that a nephew of hers should succéede her in the kingdome. Then those of the kingdome perceiuing her intent, and wearie of her, by reason of her ill liuing, sent out to seeke a bastard sonne of her husbandes, who was fledde away, and with a common consent, they raysed him for king.

He was called Tautzon, he caused cruell and rigorous Iustice to be done vpon his stepmother, as was reason for her euilles, and an example to all those of the kingdome, who by a president of her ill liuing beganne to straggle: there was of his lynage seuen kinges, that reigned 130. yeares: against the last called Concham arose Dian, of this linage there were but two kinges and reigned eighteene yeares. Against the second and last arose Outon, and was of his linage thrée kinges and reigned but fiftéene yeares: against the last there arose Outzim of this there was but two kinges and reigned nine yeares and thrée monethes, there arose against the last Tozo: he and his sonne reigned foure yeares: with the sonne of this one Auchin did fight and slewe him in the combat, and succéeded him in the kingdome: hee with other two of his lynage reigned tenne yeares, against the last of these arose vp one of the lynage of Vitey the first king, and slewe him, hee was called Zaytzon, there was of this lynage seuentéene kinges and reigned with all peace and quietnesse, thrée hundred and twentie yeares: the last of this lynage was called Tepyna, with whom did fight the gran Tartaro called Vzon, who entred into China with a mightie armie, and got all the kingdome, and it was possessed with nine Tartare kings, the which reigned 93. yeares, and intreated the inhabitantes with great tyrannie and seruitude: the last of these was called Tzintzoum, this was more cruell vnto the Chinos then any of the rest, which was the occasion that all the kingdome did ioyne together in one, and did elect a king, called Gombu, a man of great valour, and of the lynage of auncient kinges past, who by his great woorthinesse, and ioyning much people together, did so much that hee did driue all the Tartaros out of the kingdome, with the death of many thousands of them, who obstinately and without Iustice, did with all tyrannie kéepe that kingdome in possession: there was of this lynage twelue kinges with this that now reigneth: the eleuen kinges past reigned two hundreth yeares: he that now possesseth the kingdome is called Boneg, who by the death of his elder brother that died by a fall hee had from his horse, did inherite the kingdome: he is of 23. yeares of age (as they saye) and hath his mother aliue, of whom as yet there is nothing written:

so that I can write nothing in particular, but that they say, he is a gallant gentleman, and welbeloued of his subiects, and a great friende vnto Iustice. He is married with a cosen of his, and hath one sonne.
                  Those of his linage hath got of the Tartares many countries since they were driuen out of China, the which are on the other side of the mightie wall. God for his mercies sake bring them to the knowledge of his holy lawe, and accomplish a prophesie that they haue amongst them, by the which they are giuen to vnderstand that they shall be ruled and brought in subiection by men with great eyes and long beards, a nation that shall come from countries farre off, by whom they shalbe commanded, which signifieth to be Christians. The king of this countrie is had in so great reputation amongest his subiectes, that in all the prouinces where he is not resident, in the chiefe cities whereas are the vizroyes or gouernors, they haue a table of gold in the which is portred the king that nowe reigneth, and couered with a curtin of cloth of golde verie riche, and thether goeth euerie day the Loytias, which are the gentlemen, men of lawe, and ministers of Iustice, and do by duetie reuerence vnto it, as though▪ the kinge were personally present. This table and picture is discouered the first day of their feasts which they doo celebrate, and is at the newe moone of euerye month, on the which day all people do repaire and do reuerence vnto the picture, with the same respect as they would doo if hee were present: they do call the king, Lorde of the worlde, and sonne of heauen.
               
               
                  CHAP. II. Of the court and pallace of the king, and of the citie where as he is resident: and how that in all the kingdome there is not one that is Lord ouer subiectes by propertie.
                  THe habitation of this king, and almost of al his predecessors hath bin and is commonly in the citie of Taybin or Suntien: the occasion is (as they saye) for that it is néerest vnto the Trtarians, with whom continually they haue had wars, that they might the better put remedie in any necessitie that shoulde happen, or paraduenture for that the temperature or clime of

that place is more healthfull then the other prouinces, or the dwelling to be of more pleasure, as it is giuen to vnderstand by that worde Suntien, which in their language is as much to say the celestiall citie. it is of such bignesse,A citie of a daies iourney long. that for to crosse it ouer from gate to gate, a man must traueile one whole day and haue a good horse, and put good diligence, or else he shal come short: this is besides the subburbes, which is as much more ground. Amongst the Chinos is founde no varietie in the declaration of this mig
                        •
                     tie city, and of the great riches that is in it, which is a signe to be of a truth, for that they agree all in one. There is so much people in it, what of citizens and courtiers, that it is affirmed yt vpon any vrgent occasion, there may be ioyned together two hundreth thousand men, and the halfe of them to bee horsemen. At the entring into this citie, toward the orient, is situated the mightie and sumptuous pallace of the king, where he remaineth ordinarily, although hee hath other two: the one in the midst of the citie, and the other at the end towards the West. This first pallace they do testifie is of such huge bignesse and so much curiositie, that it is requisite to haue foure dayes at the least to view and sée it all. First it is compassed about with seuen walles very huge: and the space that is betwixt one wall and another, doth containe ten thousand souldiers which doo watch and gard the kings house dayly: there is within this pallace thrée score and ninetéene halles of a marueilous rich and and curious making, wherein there are many women that doo serue the king in the place of pages and squires: but the principallest to be seene in this pallace is foure halles verie rich, whereas the king giueth audience vnto such ambassadours as come vnto him from other kingdomes, or prouinces, or vnto his owne people, when they call any court of parliament (which is very seldome) for that he is not séene by his commons out of his owne house but by great chance, and yet when they doo sée him, for the most part it is by a glasse window.Foure curious halles. The first of these hals is made al of mettall very curiously wrought with manie figures: and the seconde haththe séeling and the floore wrought in the order of masons worke, all of siluer of great valure: the thirde is of fine golde wrought and inamiled verie curiously. The fourth is of so great riches, that it much excéedeth all the other thrée:

for that in it is represented the power and riches of that mightie kingdome: and therfore in their language they do cal it the hall of the kings treasure, and they do affirme that it deserueth to haue that name: for that there is in it the greatest treasure that any king hath in all the world, besides many iewels of an inestimable price, and a chaire (wherein he dooth sit) of great maiesty, made of Iuory, set full of pretious stones, and carbuncles of a great price, that in the darkest time of the night, the hall is of so great clearenesse, as though there were in it manie torches or lights: the wals are set full of stones of diuers sorts verie rich and of great vertue wrought verie curiously: and to declare it in fewe words, it is the richest and principalst thing to be séene in all the kingdome, for therein is the principallest thereof. In these foure halles are heard such ambassadours as are sent from other countries, according vnto the estate and qualitie of the king, and prouinces from whence they come: so that according as they are estéemed, so are they entertained into one of these foure hals. If that from whence they come is from a king of small power, he hath audience in the first hall: if he be of a reasonable power, in the second hal, and in this order in the rest. Within this mightie pallace, the king hath all that any humane vnderstanding can desire or aske (touching this life) in pleasures for to recreate his person, and for their quéene: for that neuer (or by great chance) they go foorth of the same: and it hath béene a customable vse amongst the kings of that countrie: that it is as a thing inherited by succession neuer to go forth. They say, their reason why they doo keepe themselues so close &amp; not to go abroade, is to conserue the mightie estate of their estade, and also to auoide for being slaine by treason (as many times it falleth so out) for which occasion you haue had kings, that in all the time of their reigne haue not gone out of their pallace, but onely the day of their oath and crownation: and besides this their close kéeping, yet haue they tenne thousande men continually (as aforesaide) in garde of the pallace both day and night, besides others that are in the courtes, staires and halles, and other places. Within the gates and wals of this mightie pallace they haue gardines, orchards, woodes and groues, whereas is all manner of hunt, and foule and great pondes full of fish. And to conclude, they haue all

manner of pleasures and delites, that may be inuented or had in any banketting house in the fielde. In all this kingdome, there is not one that is lorde ouer any subiect or vassales (as they of Turkie) neither haue they any iurisdiction proper: but that which is his patrimonie and moueables, or that which the king doth giue them in recompence of good seruice or gouernement, or for any other particular respect: all the which dooth end with the person, and is returned againe vnto the king, except he will giue it into the sonne of him that is dead, in curtesie more then by obligation or duetie: giuing to vnderstande that it is to auoyd inconueniences, and occasions of treasons, which might grow if that there were any lords that were rich, or of power, &amp; not for couetousnes or any other intent. Those whom he dooth put in authoritie, whether they are vizroyes, gouernours, or captaine generals, or whatsoeuer they be, hée giueth vnto them large wages, sufficient to sustaine them in their office, in so ample sort, that it is rather ouerplus vnto them then lacke, for that he will not that their necessitie compell them to take presents or bribes, which thing doth blinde them, that they cannot do iustice vprightly:Punished for taking bribes and vnto him that doth receiue or take any such (although it be but of smal prise) he is cruelly punished.
               
               
                  CHAP. III. The number of such subiects as doo pay vnto the king tribute in all these fifteene prouinces.
                  VNderstanding the greatnesse of this kingdome of China, and the infinite number of people that is therein, it is an easie thing to bee beléeued: the number that euery prouince hath of such as do pay tribute, as is taken out of the booke that the officers haue, whereby they do recouer that tribute: and it is affirmed, that there are as many more, such as are frée and and do pay no tribute. The Loytians and ministers of iustice, all sorts of souldiers both by sea and land (which is an infinite number) are frée and do pay nothing, the number as followeth.
                  The prouince of Paguia hath two millions seuen hundred and foure thousand that doth pay tribute to the king.
                  
                     The prouince of Santon 3. millions and 700. thousand tributers.
                  The prouince of Foquien, two millions foure hundred and seuen thousand tributers.
                  The prouince of Olam, two millions two hundred &amp; foure thousand tributers.
                  The prouince of Sinsay, thrée millions thrée hundred &amp; foure score thousand.
                  The prouince of Susuan, two millions and fiftie thousand.
                  The prouince of Tolanchia, there where as the king is resident, and is the biggest of them al: sixe millions fourescore and ten thousand.
                  The prouince of Causay, two millions thrée hundred and fiue thousand.
                  The prouince of Oquiam, thrée millions and eight hundred thousand.
                  The prouince of Aucheo, two millions eight hundred and foure thousand.
                  The prouince of Gonan, one million and two hundred thousand.
                  The prouince of Xanton, one million nine hundred fortie and foure thousand.
                  The prouince of Quicheu, two millions thirtie and foure thousand.
                  The prouince of Chequeam, two millions two hundred and fortiefoure thousand.
                  The prouince of Sancii, which is the least of all the prouinces, hath one million sixe hundred thréescore and twelue thousand tributers.
                  By this account it is found, that the tribute payers are verie many: and it is approoued in manie places of this historie, whereas they do treate of the greatnes of this kingdome, that it is the mightiest and biggest that is to bee read of in all the world. God for his mercies sake, bring them to the knowledge of his lawe, and take them out from the tyrannie of the diuell, wherein they are wrapped.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. IIII. The tribute that the king hath in these fifteene prouinces, according vnto the truest relation.
                  ALthough this kingdome is great and very rich, yet there is none that doth pay so little tribute ordinarily vnto their king as they do: neither amongst Christians, Moores nor gentiles that we know. The extraordinary and personall seruice is very much, that in some respect wee may say that they are more slaues then frée men, for that they do not possesse one foote of land but they pay tribute: in respect whereof, as also for the great misusing of them by their gouernours, will bee a great part and occasion to inuite them to receiue the lawe of the gospell, and that with great facilitie to inioy the the libertie of the same.
                  The ordinarie tribute that euery one dooth pay that dooth kéepe house, is two Mases euery yeare, which is as much as two spanish rials of plate. This tribute is verie little, yet the Loytians (which is a great part of the kingdome) do pay none, neither their gouernours nor ministers, captaines nor souldiours: the multitude of the people is so great, and the kingdome so bigge, that alonely that which they giue for expences of the king and his court is woonderfull, with customes, dueties, portages and other rents: not accounting that which is paide vnto garisons and souldiers of that kingdome, neither in that which is spent in repairing of walles of particular cities, and in men of warre at sea, and camps by land: to gouernours and iustices, which doth not enter into this account.
                  The rent which remaineth vnto the king ordinarily is this that followeth,The rent of the king. and is taken with great regard out of the booke of his excheker. Yet the Chinos do say that it is much lesse thē that they do pay at this time: for that this is of old antiquitie when as the tributes were lesse: the tributes as followeth.
                  Of pure golde from seuentéene to two and twentie killates they giue him foure millions,Puregold. and two hundred fiftiesixe thousand and nine hundred Taes: euerie one is worth ten rials and foure and twentie marauadies spanish mony.
                  Of fine siluer,Fine siluer. thrée millions one hundred fifty thrée thousand two hundred and ninetéene Taes.

                  CHAP. V. Of the men of war that are in the fifteene prouinces, as wel footmen as horsemen, and of the great care they haue in the gard of the kingdome.
                  LOoke what care and diligence this mightie king hath, that iustice should be ministred with right &amp; equitie: so likewise (yea &amp; much more) he hath touching matters that may preuent wars, which be offered, by princes adiacent vnto him, or anie other whatsoeuer. But in especiall with the Tartarians with whom they haue had continuall wars many yeare. (Although at this day) that the Tartarians doo feare him very much: in such sort as he thinketh it best to kéepe him for his friende, and doth acknowledge vnto him a certain maner of vassalage. And although at this present, and long time since he hath bin and is without any occasion of wars, that should come vpon a sodain: yet hath he the selfsame care &amp; diligēce of preuention, as though he had many &amp; grieuous enimies to defend himselfe from, or to offend them: as you shall perceiue in this that followeth. For besides that he hath in euery prouince his president &amp; counsell of war, captaine generall, and others ordinarie to take vp people, and ordaine their campes &amp; squadrons as well by sea as by land, to serue at all assaies when that occasion shall serue. So likewise he hath in euery city captaines and souldiers for their particular garde &amp; defence,Great care for to defend their countrie. and doo range &amp; watch to set their garde in order both day &amp; night, as though their enimies were at the gates. This military order they do vse and maintaine, in such sort that no nation knowne may be compared vnto them. Although speaking generally, (according vnto the relation of certaine spanish souldiers that were there, and did many times sée them) there be other nations that do excéed them both in valiantnesse, courage, and worthinesse of mind.
                  
                     They haue at the gates of all their cities, their squadrons, who let the entrie and going out of any whatsoeuer, except he haue licence of the iustice of that citie or towne, brought them in writing: the which gates they do shut and open by order and licence of their captaines, which is sent vnto them euery day, written in whited tables, and their fine vnto it. These gates are the force of all the cittie, and thereon is planted all the artilerie they haue: nigh vnto the which gate, is ordinarily the house whereas they are sounded or made. At night when they do shut their gates, they do glew papers vpon the ioinings of them: then they doo seale the papers, with the seale that the gouernour or iudge of that cittie doth weare on his finger, the which is done by himselfe, or by some other in whom he hath great confidence and trust: and they cannot open them againe in the morning vntill such time as it bee séene and acknowledged, that it hath not béene touched since the night that it was put on. So that if any haue any iourney to ride verie early in the morning, he must go forth of the citie ouer night, before the gates be shut, and remaine in the suburbes: for out of the cittie it is not possible to goe vntill the gates be open, which is not till the sunne be vp ordinarily.
                  They do not vse any castles nor forts, but great bulwarkes and gun bankes, whereas they haue continuall watch, and doo change by quarters according as wee do vse: and the officers with a great number of souldiers do range throughout the city, and bulworkes: and commonly the captaines be naturall of those prouinces, whereas they haue their charge giuen them: in consideration that the loue they haue to their countrie, doo binde them to fight to the death for the defence thereof. And for that there should be more quietnesse and rest in the cities, it is not permitted that any do weare weapons, defensiues, nor offensiues, but onely such souldiers as haue the kings pay: neither do they consent they should haue them in their houses, neither vse any in trauaile by sea nor lande. Besides all this, the king hath in the citie of Taybin and Suntiem, (whereas hee is resident) and in such cities lying there about, a great number both of horsemen and footemen, alwaies in a readinesse for to go with him into any place, for the safegarde of his person in time of necessitie.
                  
                     The souldiers of this kingdome are in two sorts and manners: the one sort are such as bee and are naturals of the citie whereas they haue their charge, and these be called in their language Cum: in this place the sonne doth succéed the father, and for lacke of an heire, the king doth prouide one in the dead mans place. Euery one of them hath his name written vpon the post of his doore, and the place appointed whither he shal go when occasion shall serue, (enimies being against that cittie or towne.) The other sort of souldiers are strangers, and are consorted for yeares or monethes to serue. These be they that ordinarily make their watches, musters, and ioyne companies for the receit of the captaines: these be called in their language Pon. These goe from one place vnto another, whereas they are commanded to go. One captaine and ancient hath charge of a thousand, and a meaner captaine with his ancient a hundreth, that doo depend vpon the other. So that for to knowe the number of people that is in a great campe, it is done with great ease, in accounting the ensignes of a thousand men, which are easily knowne. Euery chiefe or petie captaine of these, hath his house vpon the cittie wal, and his name put on it, and there he dwelleth so long as the warres indureth. These captaines euery moneth do exercise their souldiers in marching and putting them in order: sometime with quick spéed, and other times more slower, and to giue assalt and retyre as they are taught by the sound of the drum: this they do vse continually in the time of peace, as wel as in the time of warre: Also how to vse their weapons, which are ordinarie, hargabuses, pikes, targets, faunchers, brushebilles, holbards, dagars and armour. The horsemen do vse in the warres to carrie foure swords hanging at their saddell bowes, and doo fight with two at once, with great dexteritie and gallant to behold. These do accustome to go into the wars accompanied with many seruants, and familiar friends on foote, all wel armed after the gallantest manner that possible they may, These footemen be marueilous full of pollicie and ingenious in warlike or martiall affaires: and although they haue some valor for to assalt and abide the enimie, yet doo they profite themselues of policies, deuises and instruments of fire, &amp; of fire workes. Thus do they vse as wel by land in their wars, as by sea many homes of fire, full of olde iron,

and arrowes made with powder &amp; fire worke, with the which they do much harme and destroy their enimies. The horsemen do fight with bowes and arrowes, and lances, and with two swordes (as I haue saide before) and some with hargabuses. They cannot gouerne their horses very wel, for that they haue but one péece of iron that is crosse in their mouthes that serueth for a bridle: and for to make them stay, they pull but one raine, and with clapping their hands together and making of a noise before them.Uerie ill horsemen. They haue very ill saddels, so that they be al verie ill horsemen. The like prouision hath the king for the sea: hée hath great fléetes of ships, furnished with captaines and men, that doo scoure and defend the costs of the countrie with great diligence and watchings. The souldiers as well by land as by sea are paid with great liberalitie, and those that do aduantage themselues in valor, are very much estéemed, and haue great preferment and rewards. When these Chinos doo take anie prisoner in the wars, they doo not kill him, nor giue him more punishment, but to serue as a souldier in that countrie in the farthest parts from their naturall: the king paying him his wages as other souldiers are paid. These for that they may be knowne doo weare redde bonnets, but in their other apparell they do differ nothing from the Chinos. Likewise such as be condemned by iustice for criminall offences, to serue in any frontier (as is vsed much amongst them) they also weare redde caps or bonnets: and so it is declared in their sentence, that they do condemne them to the red bonnet.
               
               
                  CHAP. VI. More of the men of war which are in al these fifteene prouinces, and how many there be in euerie one of them as well horsemen as footemen.
                  IN the chapter past you do vnderstande what care these Chinos haue in the time of peace as well as in warre, for to defend their citties: and what preparations they haue generally throughout al the countrie. Now lacketh to let you know particularly the number that euery prouince hath in it selfe, the better to vnderstand the mightinesse therof. They haue in euerie prouince in their chiefe or metropolitan citie, a counsell of

warre, with a president and foure counsailers: all the which are such as haue bin brought vp from their youth in the wars, with experience of the vse of armour and weapon: so that vnto them is giuen the charge for the defence of their prouince.
                  These counsellers doo ordaine captaines, and prouide other officers and all necessaries for the warres, and send them vnto such cities and townes, whereas they sée it is néedfull. And for that in the accomplishing thereof there shalbe no lacke, the treasurer is commanded to deliuer vnto them, whatsoeuer they do aske, without any delay.
                  The number of the souldiers that euery prouince had in the yeare 1577.The number of souldiers in all China.
                      at such time as frier Martin de Herrada and his companie entered into China (hauing no wars but great peace and quietnesse) is as followeth.
                  The prouince of Paguia, whereas ordinarily the king is resident, hath two millions and one hundred and fiftie thousand footemen, and foure hundred thousand horsemen.
                  The prouince of Santon hath one hundred and twenty thousand footemen, and fortie thousand horsemen.
                  The prouince of Foquieu hath eight and fiftie thousande and nine hundred footemen, and twentie two thousand foure hundred horsemen.
                  The prouince of Olam hath thrée score and sixtéene thousand footemen, and twentie fiue thousande fiue hundred horsemen.
                  The prouince of Cinsay hath eightie thousand thrée hundred footemen, but of horsemen verie few or none, for that this prouince and the other that followe, are all mountaines, and ful of rockes and stones.
                  The prouince of Oquiam hath twentie thousande and sixe hundred footemen, and no horsemen, for the reason aforesaide.
                  The prouince of Susuan foure score and sixe thousande footemen, and foure and thirtie thousande and fiue hundred horsemen.
                  The prouince of Tolanchia, which is that which doth border vpon the Tartarians, with whom the kings of China haue had wars (as aforesaid) hath two millions &amp; eight hundred thousād footmen, &amp; two hundred &amp; ninty thousand horsemen, &amp; are the

most famous and best in all the whole kingdome: for that they are brought vp in the vse of armour from their youth: and many times exercised the same in times past, when they had their ordinarie war with their borderers the Tartarians.
                  
                  The prouince of Causay hath fiftie thousand footemen, and twentie thousand two hundred and fiftie horsemen.
                  The prouince of Aucheo, (there whereas the friers were) hath foure score and sixe thousand footemen, and fortie eight thousand horsemen.
                  The prouince of Gonan fortie foure thousand footemen, and fouretéene thousand fiue hundred horsemen.
                  The prouince of Xanton hath fiftie two thousand footemen, and eightéene thousand nine hundred horsemen.
                  The prouince of Quincheu hath fortie eight thousand and seuen hundred footemen, and fiftéene thousande thrée hundred horsemen.
                  The prouince of Chequeam thirty foure thousand footmen, and thirtéene thousand horsemen.
                  The prouince of Saucii, which is least of them all hath forty thousand footemen, and sixe thousand horsemen. All these people aforesaid, euerie prouince is bound (by an order set downe in parlement) to haue in a redinesse, the which is an easie thing to be done:The souldier is roially paid the one is for that the king doth pay them roiallie, the other for that they do dwel in their owne natural countries and houses, wheras they do inioy their patrimonies and goods: leauing it vnto their sonnes, who doo inherite the same and his office as aforesaid. In the time of wars they are bounde to assist the place that hath most necessitie. By this account it plainely appeareth that all these prouinces (which may better be called kingdomes) considering their greatnes) haue fiue millions &amp; eight hundred fourtie sixe thousand &amp; fiue hundred footemen,The number of footemen &amp; horsemen. &amp; nine hundred fortie eight thousand thrée hundred &amp; fifty horsemen. All the which, if in valor and valiantnes might be equalled vnto our nations in Europe, they were sufficient to conquer ye whole world. And although they are more in number &amp; equal in policies, yet in their valiantnesse &amp; courage they are far behind. Their horse for the most part are little, but great traueilers: Yet they say, within the countrie there are verie great &amp; excellent good horse. I do not here declare the industrie

that might (with the fauour of God) be vsed to win and ouercome this people, for that the place serueth not for it: and I haue giuen large notice thereof, vnto whom I am bound. And againe my profession is more to bee a meanes vnto peace, then to procure any warres: and if that which is my desire might be doone, it is, that with the word of God which is the sworde that cutteth the hearts of men, wherewith I hope in the Lorde to sée it.
               
               
                  CHAP. VII. Of a law amongst the Chinos, that they cannot make anie wars out of their owne countrie, neither go forth of the same, neither can any stranger come in without licence of the king.
                  ALthough in many things that haue bin séene in this kingdome is shewed and declared the sharpe and ripe witts of these men, and with what wisedome and prudence they doo gouerne their countries: yet wherein they doo most manifest the same (in my iudgement) is in that which shalbe declared in this chapter. They without all doubt séeme to excéede the Gréekes Carthagenians &amp; Romanes, of whom the old ancient histories haue signified to vs, &amp; also of those later times: who for to conquere strange countries did separate themselues so farre from their natural, that they lost their owne countries at home. But these of this kingdome being forewarned (as ye prouerbe saith:) Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum, By the hurt of another &amp;c. they haue found by experience yt to go forth of their owne kingdome to conquer others, is the spoile and losse of much people, and expences of great treasures, besides the trauaile and care which continually they haue to sustaine that which is got, with feare to be lost againe: so that in the meane time whilest they were occupied in strange conquests, their enimies the Tartarians and other kings borderers vnto them did trouble and inuade them doing great damage and harme. And more considering that they do possesse one of the greatest &amp; best kingdomes of the world, as well for riches as for fertilty: by reason whereof, and by the great aboundance of things that the country doth yéeld: many strange nations do profite themselues from them, and they haue néed of none other nation, for

that they haue sufficient of all things necessarie to the mainteining of humane life.They haue no neede of other nations. In consideration whereof they called a generall court of parliament, whether came all vizroyes and gouernours and other principall men of all the fiftéene prouinces: and there they did communicate, to put remedy in this great inconuenience in the best manner possible. Then after they had wel considered of the same with great care &amp; diligēce, taking the iudgement particular of euery one, &amp; in generall by common consent they found it requisit for their quietnes &amp; profite, &amp; a thing most conuenient for the common wealth to leaue al yt they had got &amp; gained out of their owne kingdome: but specially such countries as were farre off. And from that day forwards not to make any wars in any place: for that from thence did procéed a knowne damage &amp; a doubtfull profite: and being altogether conformable, they did request the king that was at that present that he would cal home al such people, as he had in other kingdomes bordering there about vnder his obedience, perswading him that in so doing, he should remaine a mightie prince, more richer, more in quiet and in more securitie. Then the king perceiuing the request and petition of his kingdome &amp; subiects, and being fully satisfied that this perswasion was requisite to be put in execution: he straightwayes set it a worke, and commanded vpon great penalties, that al his subiects and vassals naturall that were in any strange countries, that in a time limited, they should returne home to their own country and houses: and likewise to the gouernours of the same countries, that they should in his name abandon &amp; leaue the dominion and possession that he had of them: excepting such as would of their owne good will acknowledge vassalage, and giue him tribute, &amp; remaine friends, as vnto this day the Lechios &amp; other nations do. This law was then established and is inuiolablie kept to this day: in the which it is first commanded that none whatsoeuer vpon paine of death, shall make or begin warre in any part without his licence.Straight lawes. Also on the said penaltie, that no subiect of his shall nauigate by sea out of the kingdome without the said licence. Also that whosoeuer will go from one prouince to another within the said kingdome, to traficke in buying and selling, shall giue suerties to returne againe in a certaine time limited, vpon paine to bee disnaturalled of the country.

Likewise that no stranger whatsoeuer shal come in by sea nor by land, without his expresse licence, or of the gouernours of such ports or places whereas they shall come or ariue. And this licence must be giuen with great consideration, aduising the king therof. Al which lawes haue béene so inuiolablie kept and obserued, that it hath béene the occasion that this mightie kingdome hath not come to notice and knowledge but of late yeares. All the which that is said, séemeth to be true, for that it is cléerely found in their histories and books of nauigations of old antiquitie: whereas it is plainely séene that they did come with their shipping vnto the Indies, hauing conquered al that is from China, vnto the farthest part thereof. Of all the which they indured possessers in great quietnes, till such time as they ordeined the law of abandoning, of their owne good will, as aforesaid. So that at this day there is great memory of them in the ilands Philippinas, and on the cost of Coromande, which is the cost against the kingdome of Norsinga towards the sea of Cengala: whereas is a towne called vnto this day the soile of the Chinos, for that they did reedifie &amp; make the same. The like notice &amp; memory is there in the kingdom of Calicut, wheras be many trées and fruits, that the naturals of that countrie do say, were brought thither by the Chinos, when that they were lords and gouernours of that countrie. Likewise in those dayes they were of Malaca, Siam and Chapaa, &amp; other of their borderers: Also it is to be beléeued of ye Ilands of Iapon, for that there are many tokens of the Chinos vnto this day, &amp; the naturals of the country are much after the fashion of the Chinos, and many particular things that do giue vs to vnderstand: and some lawes that are obserued and kept in China. But now in these dayes the gouernours of the sea ports do dispence with the law, that forbiddeth ye going out of the kingdome, by certain giftes which is giuen thē by merchants, to giue them secret licence, that they may go and traficke in Ilands bordering there about, as vnto the Philippinas, whither come euery yeare many ships ladē with merchandise of great riches, of the which is brought many times into Spaine. Likewise they do trauaile vnto other parts and places, wheras they vnderstand they may profite themselues. Yet they do not giue any such licence vntill they haue giuen suerties to returne within one whole yeare.
                  
                     The desire of gaine hath caused them to traueile to Mexico, whither came the yeare past in anno 1585. thrée merchants of China, with very curious things, &amp; neuer staied till they came into Spaine and into other kingdomes further off. Likewise the said iudge and gouernours doo giue licence vnto strangers (in the order aforesaid) for to enter into their ports to buy &amp; sel, but first vpon examination and charge, that they should haue a great care not to demand any licence but to the same intent. Then haue they their licence with a time limited, and with condition that they shall not procure to goe about their cities, neither to see the secrets thereof. And this is giuen in writing vpon a whited table, which is set vpon the fore partes of their ships, that when they come to an anker in any port it may be séene of the kéepers and guards that they sinke them not, but let them peaceably to enter and to traficke in buying and selling, paying their ordinarie customes due vnto the king.
                  In euery port there is a scriuener or notarie, put there by the gouerners, that dooth set downe in memorie the day and houre that any shippe doth enter in, in order: that whether hée be a stranger or natural to take in his lading and dispatch, according vnto the old custome of those ports, the which is inuiolably kept: which is the occasion that they do lade and dispatch in so short time, and with so great quietnesse, as though there were but one shippe, although many times you shall sée in one port two thousande ships small and great. In this sort with a bought licence did the Portugals traficke from the Indies in Canton a prouince of this kingdome, and in other parts of that kingdome, as they themselues haue declared, and likewise the Chinos.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. VIII. Of the kings royall counsell, and the order they haue to knowe euerie moneth what dooth passe in all the kingdome.
                  THe king hath in the citie of Taybin, wheras he is resident a royall counsell of twelue counsellers, and a president: chosen men throughout al the kingdome, and such as haue had experience in gouernement many yeares.
                  For to be one of the counsell, it is the highest and supremest

dignitie that a man can come vnto: for that (as aforesaid) in all this kingdome, there is neither Prince, Duke, Marquesse, Earle nor Lord, that hath any subiectes but the king only, and the prince his sonne. These counsellers, and the gouernors of these prouinces by them appointed bee such personages, that they are respected and esteemed for the time of their continuance in the same estimation, as is the other, where as they haue these titles.
                  For to be one of this counsell, it is not sufficient that they be expert and learned in the lawes of the countrie,Councellers must be expert in sciences. and in morall and naturall Philosophie, and commenced in the same: but they must be also expert in Astrologie and iudgements. For they say, he that must be of this supreme counsell, by whome is gouerned all these fiftéene prouinces: it is requisite that they know all this that is saide, for to prognosticate what shall succéede and happen, the better to prouide for all necessities that shall come. These twelue doo sit in counsell ordinarily in the kinges pallace, for the which there is a hall appointed maruellous richly trimmed: and in the same thirtéene chayres, sixe of them of golde, and sixe of siluer: both the one and the other of great price, wrought with great curiositie: yet the thirtenth is more richer, for that it is of golde and set full of precious stones of great value, &amp; that is placed in the middest of them vnder a canopie or cloth of estate, of cloth of gold: in the which is imbrodered the kinges armes, and is as it is saide, certaine serpentes wrought with golde wyer: in this chayre the president doth sitte when the king is not in presence: but if hee be there (as séeldome he is) then doth the president sit in the first and highest of the chaires on the right hand, which be of gold: in the which, and in the other of siluer, they bee placed according vnto their antiquitie: in this sort, that if the president do die, then do the most auncient procéede and inherite his roome, and in his chaire doth the fift person rise on the side of the golden chaires: and so from the fourth vnto the fift: and in this order all the rest arise in the chaires of siluer, passing into the other chaires of golde. This may the president doo, preferring euerie one in order (if any doo die) without the consent of the king. And if any of these chaires be voyd, then doth the counsell choose an other by voices: the which is done by vprightnes,

and he which hath the most is preferred: but the chiefest in this preferment is merit and sufficiencie. If he that is choosen be absent in any gouernment, then doo they send for him: but if hee bee present in the citie, then doo they carrie him before the king: giuing him to vnderstand of their election, in whose power it is to accept, or to make it voyde: which neuer doth happen. Then the king himselfe on his owne handes, according vnto their custome, doth make him sweare a solemne oth that he shall doo vpright iustice according vnto the lawes of the countrie: and that he shall likewise doo vprighly in the choosing of viceroyes and gouernours or any other Iustices, and not be led with affections nor passions, neyther receiue anie bribes himself, nor any other for him: with many other things in this order and effect: and aboue all thinges hee shall not bee partaker, neyther consent to anye treason at anie time against the king: but rather if that hee doo vnderstande of anie such directly or indirectly: hee shall straight wayes giue the kinge to vnderstande thereof or his counsell of all that hee dooth knowe or vnderstande, alwaye fauouring with his industrie and force▪ the preseruation of peace and life of the king.
                  This oth of homage being doone, they doo carrie him vnto the chaire which is on the left hande in the hall, and doo giue him the possession with great solemnitie: for the which, certaine dayes after there is great feastes in the citie as well by them of the counsell as by the citizens and courtiers: during the which time, the marchants do leaue their contractions and trafickes, and handicraft men their occupations.
                  If any occasion bee requisi
                        •
                     e to talke with the king there is none that speaketh with him but the president, and if it so fall out that hee be sicke, then the most auncient and vppermost in the golden chayres dooth talke with him at all times when néede requireth: but when he talketh with him hee is on his knées, and his eyes inclyned to the grounde, and neuer mooueth although the talke endureth two houres. He is paide with the same money that all viceroyes, gouernours, iustices and captaines of the kingdome are. when they will talke with the president it is in the selfe same order.
                  In this royall counsell euerie moneth they doo knowe all

thinges that doo happen in all the kingdome woorthie to bee aduised of, and this is without falt: for that those which doo gouerne the prouinces haue expresse commaundement to sende notice vnto the court of all thinges that doo happen in anye of their prouinces, touching warres, the estate of the countrie▪ the kinges rents, or any other thing: the which is accomplished with so great care, that although it bee a prouince distant fiue hundred leagues from the court: yet the post doth not misse his day appointed. And those which do first come, do tarrie till the last or furthest off doo come, and then vpon the day appointed they do all together giue their relations. Those which are farre off for to be at the court so soone &amp; at the instant as those which are nigh at hand doo send postes daily, that the one may ouertake the other. They do run post after the vse of Italy &amp; Spain with a horne, but they were woont to haue a coller of belles, the better to be heard: so yt the postmasters when they do heare the horne or bels, do straight waies bridle their horse to be in a readines. Likewise, if their iourney be to passe by water (as many times it hapneth) then ye boat-men do make their barks readie.
                  Then when the counsell hath taken relation of all the posts in effect, the president incontinent doth giue a straight account thereof vnto the king: then he or the counsell by his order (if anie such néede requireth) do put remedie for that that is néedfull for the time. And if it be requisite to send any Iustice about the same, he is straight wayes appointed, and dispatched and sent in all haste and with great secrecie: and this Iustice doth make inquiries in such sort that it is not knowen, no not in the citie where the fault is committed.
                  And for that, touching this matter it shall bee spoken of more at large in chapters following, I will conclude with this: that this king will haue such dominion ouer his kingdome and subiectes, that although it be great with so manie Prouinces, Cities and Townes, yet not one Uiceroy, Gouernor nor Iustice can put any man vnto death, without his sentence be first confirmed by the kinge and his royall counsell, except it be in the warres actually, for that there in the delaying thereof may growe some perill: therefore they doo permit the captaine generall or his lieftenant to behead or hang what so euer souldier that shall offende or doo anie ill thing,

this may they do without consentment of the king or his counsell, onely with the consentment of the kinges Treasorer, or of the generall of the fielde: the which bee both of them graue personages, and they must be both conformable in their iudgementes or els they cannot execute death.
               
               
                  CHAP. IX. Ofsuch presidents and ministers as the king doth put in euerie prouice, and the order that they haue in their gouenment.
                  YOu do vnderstand howe the two prouinces. Paguia and Tolanchia are gouerned by the supreme counsell of the king: and such ministers as they doo send to gouerne. The other thirtéene prouinces that do remaine, haue eyther of them a vizroy or gouernor,Euery prouince hath his viceroy. whom the common people do call Insuanto: who is continually resident, and doth dwell in the metropolitane citie, whereof the prouince doth commonly beare the name. And although all the kinges officers and Iustices of what sort of administration they are, be generally called by the name of Loytia: yet euerie one hath a speciall and a particular name besides, according vnto his office that he doth execute: of the which and of their proper names I will giue you to vnderstand, for that it doth differ from our purpose. The vizeroy that is in euerie prouince principall and supreme magistrate in place of the king, they do call him Comou. Th
                        •
                      second in dignitie is the gouernour of all the prouince, and he is called Insuanto, who hath verie little lesse maiestie than the viceroy: then the Corregidor or gouernor that is resident in any citie: where as is neither viceroy nor gouernor, is called Tutuan, all of this degrée. Of any thing that is of importance of what citie so euer they be, they do giue relation thereof vnto the higher gouernor called Insuanto, and likewise this Insuanto vnto the viceroy or Comon, whose charge is to giue the king to vnderstand thereof or his royall counsell, by the postes that we haue spoken of before. The third in dignitie is called Ponchasi, this is the president or counsell of the kinges reuenewes, who hath vnder him a counsell and many ministers and officers, as sargents and others which do recouer the

rents in euerie prouince. This state dooth giue account of all his office vnto the Tutuan: after that he hath paide all kind of wages and charges ordinarie and extraordinarie, due to any officer of the kinges in all that prouince.
                  The fourth degrée or dignitie is called Totoc,
                     Captaine generall. and this is captaine generall of all souldiers as well footmen as horsemen. The fift is called Auchasi, he is president and gouernour ouer Iustices both criminall and ciuill: and doth determine with his counsell all matters in difference, whatsoeuer that doo appeale vnto him from other meaner Iustices. The sixt is called Aytao: this is generall puruier and president of the counsell of warre: whose office is to prouide souldiers when that it is requisite or necessitie demaundeth, and to prouide ships, munitions and victuals for any fléete that shall passe by sea: as that be requisite by land, and for the suppliment of garrisons in cities and coastes. To this is giuen the charge to examine such strangers that do come to any prouince, to knowe of whence they are, and wherefore they do come, and of all other thinges, that after beeing knowen, to giue the viceroy to vnderstande thereof, and of all thinges néedfull.
                  These sixe offices or charge are of great authoritie and they that haue the execution thereof are had in great reuerence: euerie one of them hath in societie or counsell, tenne, which are men chosen of great experience and diligence, and they do help him in the exhibition and dispatch of matters touching that office. When they are in place of counsell, which is in the pallace of the viceroy (whereas euerie office hath his place appointed, garnished in very good order) their sociates are diuided in two partes, fiue of them do sit on the right hand of the president, and fiue on the left hand: those which do sit on the right hande are the most auncientes and haue the more preheminence, and doo differ from the other that be on the left hande in this thing only, for that they do weare wastes or girdels imbossed with gold, and yealow hattes: and they on the left hand haue their girdels imbossed with siluer, and weare blewe hats: the which girdels, with gold and siluer, and hats yealow and blewe, there is none that is permitted to weare but onelye the counsellers. Likewise these and the presidents do weare the kinges armes on their breastes and backes, imbrodered with golde

without the which, they can not goe foorth to anie place where they must be séene: neyther sitte in Iustice to determine anie thing whatsoeuer. If they doo, they are not onely disobedient, but are seuerely punished at the time of their visitation.
                  If the President of any of these counsels doo die, then one of the auncientest of the counsellers dooth succéede him in the office, obseruing in all thinges the order, as I haue saide in the Chapter past of the royall counsell.A very good propertie of Iustices. All these Iustices generally haue a maruellous morall vertue, and that is, they be all very patient in hearing any complaynt, although it be declared with choller, and proude spéech. It is the first thing that is taught them in their schooles, they are verye well nourtered, and courteous in their spéeches, although it bee with them that they haue condemned by lawe. If that vppon any necessitie they must goe into any part of the prouince to make any information of importaunce, then is appointed one of the counsell, and hee goeth alone, but he hath with him the authoritie of them all.
                  Besides these sixe Counsellers or Iudges aforesaide, there bee others of lesse dignitie (although greatly respected, as all ministers of Iustice bee in this kingdome) and they are called as followeth: Cautoc, this is the chiefe auncient-bearer, Pochim, the seconde treasourer: Pochinsi, he that kéepeth the seale royall: Autzatzi, he is as the maior or bailife of any citie or towne. There be also other thrée officers which are called Guytay, Tzia, Tontay, these doo kéepe court and haue audience in their houses once a wéeke: and when they do open their doores, there is shott off foure péeces of artilerie, to giue all men to vnderstande that they are in place readie to heare, and to doo Iustice. If they do finde any that is culpable or faultie, they doo straight wayes sende them with a Sargent vnto the ordinarie Iustice of the Citie, which is called Zompau, with a bill or note in the which is signified the punishment that he must haue.
                  Euerie ordinarie Iustice hath committed to his charge, a thousand souldiers. He can not excéed his limit nor iurisdictiō, neyther can anie other haue to doo in his charge.A very good order. Euerie night they doo range their circuit, and doo cause that euerie

one may be quiet in his house, and to put out their candelles and lightes in time, to auoyde fires, which hath happened amongest them verie great, by reason that their houses are so néere one to an other, and all the vpper partes of their houses wrought with tymber, according vnto the vse of Byskaye: and all suche as they doo finde with light after the houre limited, they are punished verie asperly. From these there is no appellation but vnto suche Iustices as are sent from the court: and besides them vnto none but vnto 
                        〈◊〉
                      that doo come ordinarily, who doo vndoo and make satisfaction of all griefes or wronges doone by the other, and these are called in their language Gomdim, which is as much to say, a righter of all griefe: this man is respected more than all the rest.
                  Besides all these there be other particular officers, which be called Tompo: these haue the charge to sée the prouision of victualles, and to put a price on them, an other is called Tibuco, he that dooth arest and punish vagabundes and idle persons. Quinche is the chéefe Sargent, Chomcan, is the kéeper of the prison: this is one that they haue in great reuerence, for that he hath a priuilege aboue all the rest: that after hee hath done his dutie vpon his knées at his first entrie, hee may tell his tale on foote, and so can not the rest doo, but knéeling.
                  When that these gouernours or Iustices doo newly come into these Prouinces or Cities, ordeyned and sent by the supreme counsell: they doo sende two or thrée dayes before they come themselues their letters patentes and prouisions: the which being séene and obeyed, there goeth foorth to receiue him all the Loytias and men of warre with their souldiers and ensignes military, and other officers making great feastes and pastimes.
                  Likewise the citizens at this time doo hange their stréetes with clothes of silke and other thinges very richly, and trimmed with flowers, bearing him companie vnto his lodging with much musicke and sound of instrumentes.
                  Aboue all these dignities &amp; offices there is one which is called Quinchay, which is to be vnderstood in their language (the golden seale) this goeth not from the court, but vpon

waightie matters and of great importance touching the quietnesse of all the kingdome. The order they haue in the choyse of these Iustices and officers, and of other matters touching good gouernement, shall be declared vnto you in the Chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. X. Here is prosecuted the manner howe they do choose their gouernors and Iustices, and howe they doo execute the same.
                  ALl such officers as I haue declared vnto you in the Chapter past, the king dooth ordaine them by consent of his counsell, who doo informe themselues with a particular diligence of the qualitie and behauiour of the person that shall be elected. The principall matter that they doo aduertise themselues, is: that the viceroy, gouernour or counseller, be not a naturall of that countrey that he is prouided for: and that for to preuent the inconuenience that might happen in the executing of good Iustice:A very good consideration which many times chaunceth, eyther for the loue of his friendes and kinsfolkes, or else for the hate hee hath to his enimies. All such as are prouided in these offices, after that they do depart from the court whereas the charge is giuen them, til they come to the prouince, citie or towne, wheras they shall remaine in Iustice, they doo spende nothing on their owne horses, for that in all places whereas they doo trauaile or come, the king hath houses appointed, whereas they are receiued and lodged, and serued of all thinges necessarie, as well for horses for themselues, as horses for them that come with him: likewise of barkes and boates, if that his iourney be by water, all is of frée cost: it is all appointed what they shall haue to eate, which is conformable vnto the qualitie of his person, and the office he hath in charge. And when they do come vnto such houses as are appointed by the king to receiue and cherish them: they of the house do aske him if he will haue his pittance or ordinarie in money, or in victualles: who if he haue any kinsfolkes or friendes in that place that will inuite him, then dooth hee demaund it in money, and kéepe it to himselfe. These houses are maruelously well prouided of beds, and all

other things necessarie: for that the Ponchas, who is president of the kinges reuenewes, hath a particular care to see all these things well furnished, by a commandement from the king and the supreme counsell. When they doo come vnto the citie or towne whereas they take the charge of gouernment, after they haue giuen the intertainment vnto them with feasts &amp; pastime as is declared in the Chapter past, then do they bring him and lodge him in the kings house, and do prouide him of seruants &amp; all thinges necessarie that belongeth vnto him, and ministers néedefull for the execution of iustice, who likewise haue their abiding in the same house, as sergeants and notaries, and other ministers of lesse authoritie. The king doth pay them all sufficient wages, for that it is forbidden vpō great penalties, to take bribes or any other thing of any clyent. Likewise ye Iudges be straightly charged &amp; commāded, &amp; that is one of the chiefest articles that is giuen them frō the counsel, not to consent to be visited of any clyents in their houses, neither can they pronounce any sentence but in the place of publike audience, &amp; in the presence of all the officers, and it must be done in such sort that all men that are in place of audience may heare it, and is doone in this sort following: The Iudge doth set himselfe in the seat of iustice, then do the porters put thēselues at the entring or doores of the hall: who do name with a lowde &amp; high voice the person that doth enter in to demand iustice, &amp; the effect of that he doth 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Then the plaintife doth knéele downe somewhat a far off from the Iudge, and doth with a loud voice declare his griefe or demand, or else in writing. If it be in writing, then one of the scriueners or notaries doth take the petition &amp; doth read it, the which being vnderstood by ye Iudge, he doth straightwaies prouide vpon the same that which is agréeable vnto iustice, &amp; doth firme the petition with his own firme with red inke, and commandeth what is needful to be done. These Iudges are straitly charged and commanded by the kinges authoritie, that they must go fasting into ye hal of audience, or iudgement hall, without drinking of anywine, and they must giue no sentence with wine, and that is such a custome amongst them, that whosoeuer dooth breake it is seuerely punished. By way of phisicke they do permit before they doo go to giue any sentence to cōfort themselues with some conserues or such like. But wine in no

maner of wise, although they bee sicke of any infirmitie, &amp; the lacke therof to be hurtfull vnto them, for they estéeme it a lesse euill to leaue of the hearing of any matter, then to giue any sentence after that they haue eaten or dronke. These matters being executed in publike (which is maruelously obserued &amp; kept) it is not possible yt any of the officers should take any bribes, but it must be discouered by one of them: and for that they are vsed with great rigour in their residence, euerie one is afraid of his companion, and are one to an other (in this case) great enemies. The sergeants and notaries &amp; the other officers are maruelous precise in the executing of their office: if that any doo not his duetie in his office, they take him and put a little banner in his hand, &amp; he remaineth with the same, knéeling on his knées till the court of audience be ended. Then do the Iudge commaund the bedelles to giue him so many whippes as hee doth deserue for the neglecting of his office. This same is little estéemed amongest them, for that it is a common thing vsed amongest them, when that anie of these Iudges will go abroade into the Citie (as seeldome times they doo for the reseruing of their authoritie) they are accompanied with the officers and ministers of iustice, and that in so good order, that the first two doo carrie siluer mases, after the manner as they doo in Rome carrie the mases before the Cardinalles. They doo carrie them vpon long roddes, which doth signifie that in the name of the king they are in those offices: then after them followeth other two, and they do carrie ech of them in his hand a long cane and very straight, which doth signifie the vpright iustice that ought to be done, and is doone by that Iudge that thers goeth: then followeth them other two, and they doo trayle ech of them a cane vpon the ground with long red laces, and at the endes, tassels, which doth signifie the instrumentes wherewith they do whippe the faultie or malefactors: then followeth them other two with tables, like vnto white targets, in the which is written the name of the Iudge, with his title &amp; office. The rest, which be many in number, do accompanie him to do him worship and honor. Those two that we spake of before, that do carrie the ma
                        •
                     es, do crie out and make a noyse vnto the people to apart themselues, and to make roome that the Iudge may passe: the which is straightwayes accomplished,

for that by experience they know that he that doth neglect the same, is incontinent punished in the stréete without remission: and the respect they haue vnto him is such, that not one of what state or degrée soeuer he be, that dare mooue himself at such time as he doth passe by, neither crosse the stréetes (except it be some superior Iudge, vnto whom the inferiours doth the like reuerence). If any man do offend therein, he is then straightwaies punished. In all matters of lawe as ciuill as criminall, the Iudges do nothing but by writing, and do pronounce the sentences, and examine witnesses in publike, before all the rest of the officers, because no subtilty nor falshood shalbe vsed in their demaundes, neither in their writings, to set downe other then the truth. Euerie witnesse is examined by himselfe, and if he do double in his declaration, then do they ioyne together, and make their demaunde from one to an other, til by their striuing they may come to a better knowledge of the truth. But when by these meanes they cannot bring it to light, then doo they giue them torment, for to make them confesse: (beléeuing that without it such persons as haue experience and knowledge will tell the truth.)
                  In matters of great importance, and such as doo touch graue personages, the Iudge will not trust the scriuener or notarie to write any information: but they with their owne handes will write the declaration of any witnesse, and will consider verie much of that which is declared. This great diligence is the occasion that fewe times there is any that doth complaine of any ill iustice doone, the which is a great and notable vertue: and ought to be imitated of all good Iustices, for to auoyd many inconueniences which doo happen for the not vsing the same, the which these Gentiles haue great care to performe: who beside the prosecution of right Iustice, without respect or exception of any person, do vse certaine preuentions worthie to be suffered.
                  First these Iudges in al cities &amp; townes of their iurisdiction, do number the housholds, and do repart them in ten and tenne housholds, &amp; vpon the tenth house they do hang a table or signe whereon is writen the names of those ten housholders with a cōmandemēt in the which generally they are cōmanded &amp; euery one by him selfe particular, yt hauing any knowledg or notice

that any of those ten housholders haue committed any trespasse or fault against any of the rest, or against himselfe, that is hurtfull vnto his neighbours or to the commonaltie, to go straight way &amp; giue the iustice to vnderstand thereof, that the fault may be punished with a mendment vnto the offender, &amp; an example to al other. And vnto him that doth know any such offence and wil not declare it, is allotted the same punishment yt the offender should haue,An occasion of amitie betwixt neighbours. which is the occasion that one neighbour hath a care of an other, &amp; liueth vnder feare, least they should giue occasion to be complained of. And againe, that their enimies may not this way take any aduantage. When that any of these ten neighbours doth remooue into an other stréete or into any other citie or towne to dwell, or will make any long iorney, hee is bound to ring a bell, or play on a coper kettle amongest all the neighbours for the space of ten dayes before he doth remooue or depart, and to aduise them all of his departure, and whether: for that if he do owe any thing, or any thing be lent, that they may come and demaund it before their departure, because that none shall loose yt which is theirs. And if it so fall out that any shall depart without vsing this diligence, the Iustice doth compell the rest of his neighbours yt are written on the signe, to pay his debt, because they did not aduise the Iustice or his creditors before his departure. Such as do owe money or debts and will not paye: (proouing the debt they doo execute their goods:) if they haue none, they put them in prison, and limit a time for him to pay the same. But if it passe, and the debt not paide nor his creditor contented: For the first time they doo whippe them moderately, and do appoint him the second time limited, for to pay ye same: if he do then misse, they do whip him more cruelly, and doo appoint him on other time, and so doo prosecute the same till he die with punishments, which is ye occasion yt euery one doth pay that he oweth, or procure amongst his friends to pay, or else giue himselfe for a slaue vnto his creditor, to shun the trouble of the prison, and the paine of whippings, which is a thing not to be suffered.
                  These Iudges do vse two maner of torments, to make them to confesse the truth, when by fayre meanes they can not, or by pollicie, the which first is procured with great care and diligence: the one is on their féete, and the other on their hands,

and is so terrible that it cannot be suffered, but of force they do confesse that which the Iudge doth pretende to know: yet doo they execute none of them except first they haue good information, or at the least, Semiplena, or else so many indicions that it is a sufficient information for the same. The tormentes on the hands is giuen with two stickes as bigge as two fingers, and a span long, turned round, and full of hooles in all places, wherin are put cordes to pull in &amp; out: their fingers of both their hands are put into the cordes,Cruell tormentes. and little and little they do pinch them till in the end they do breake them at the iointes with an incredible paine vnto them that doo suffer it, and yt causeth them to giue great shrikes and groanes that will mooue any man to compassion. And if it so come to passe that by this cruell torment they will not confesse, and that the Iudge do vnderstand by witnesse and by indicions that hee is faultie and culpable, then dooth he commaund to giue him the torment of the feete, which is a great deale more cruell than that of the handes, and is in this sort: they take two péeces of woode foure square of foure spannes long and one spanne broade, and are ioyned together with a ginne, and hooles boored thorough,A more cruel
                           •
                         torment. and put thorough them cordes, and in the middest of these bordes they doo put the whole foote, and straine the cordes, and with a mallet they do stryke vpon the cordes wherewith they do breake all the bones, and cause them to suffer more paine and griefe than with the torment of the handes. At the executing of these torments, the supreme Iudges are alwaies present, the which seeldome times doth happen: for that such as be culpable will sooner confesse than suffer those torments, desiring rather to die some other death that is not so cruell, than to suffer the paines of this torment.
                  The prisons that they haue are no lesse cruell and rigorous as you shall vnderstand in a chapter by it selfe hereafter.
               
               
                  CHAP. XI. Of the visiters that the king doth send euery yeare to visite the in
                        ••
                     rior Iudges of his prouinces, and of the punishing of such as they do find culpable.
                  IT is to be woondred at the great and vigilant care that this heathen prince hath, in that his ministers and Iudges as wel

viceroyes,A great care to do true Iustice. gouernors▪ presidents as anie other officers should execute their offices well and vprightly, as they ought to doo: for in the end of thrée yeares that their gouernmēt doth indure, they do take of thē in residence, straight account by the Iudges thereof who bee called Chaenes. Likewise they doo dispatch euerie yeare in great secrecie into euerie prouince, other Iudges and visitors that be called Leachis, the which are persons of great confidence, and prooued by experience of long time to be of good life, good customes, and haue done good seruice in the administring of iustice vprightly. These as they trauaile do inquire in euerie citie and towne that they come in, (not being knowen, and in verie 
                        ••
                     cret manner) all griefes and iniustice that is done in that prouince: which is the occasion that euerie one dooth liue (as the prouerbe sayth) with their face discouered. These do carrie from the king so great authoritie in their commissions giuen them, that without returning to the court, if they finde any delict culpable they may apprehend the Iudges and punish them, suspend, and repriue, and do any thing touching their commission at their owne pleasure, so that it be not to take away the life of any man. This (as it is said) none can do without the consent of the king.
                  And because they should execute their office the better in this visitation, and with Iustice and equitie, they do make them to sweare to be loyall,Ceremonies in performing of their oth. true and secret. The which oth, is executed in this order: they doo giue him to drinke thrée times of a certaine beuerage which they doo vse, &amp; that is the confirming of their oth. And for that their departure should be with more secrecie, the counsell doth commaund their secretaries to make their prouisions▪ leauing in blank a space for his name that shal haue the prouision, and for the name of the prouince, whether he shall goe, declaring nothing but that which is their ordinarie, that wheresoeuer the Loytia or Iudge (being so dispatched) shall come, that they shall obey him as the king himselfe. But when soeuer it is in secret determined who shall goe, 
                        •
                     hen doth the president of the counsel command the prouision to be sealed, then he himselfe doth write his name in, and the prouince whether he doth goe. And therewithall hee dooth depart from the court in great secrecie, and vnknowen of any who it is, nor whether he doth go, nor wherefore.
                  
                     Then when he doth come to the prouince, citie or town, whether he is sent, hee dooth with like secrecie make his inquirie how the viceroy or gouernour doth vse himselfe in his gouernment, and how all other officers do execute their offices, without knowing from whence he came, nor whether he will, neither what he doth pretend. So after that hee hath passed thoroughout all the prouince, and is fullie certified of all his desire, then doth hee goe vnto the chiefe or metropolitane citie, whereas are resident all those Iudges against whom hee hath made his visitation, and there he dooth remaine and abide till such time as the Tutam or viceroy doth make a generall counsell, which is once a month at the least: and at such time as they are in their counsell hall, (and peraduenture without thought of any such Iudge that should come) then this Uisitor doth goe vnto the doore, and sayth vnto the porter, goe and tell them of the councell, that here is a Ui
                        •
                     itor that must, and will come in, to notifie vnto them a commandement from the king: then the viceroy (vnderstanding by these words what he might be) doth commaund the doores to be open, and doth himselfe and the rest that are with him, rise vp from their seates, and doth goe and receiue him as their superiour Iudge: who doth enter with his prouision open in his handes (which dooth not cause a small feare amongest them all, but in especiall vnto suche as their owne conscience doth accuse them): he doth read his prouision in the presence of them all, and at the instant of the conclusion, the viceroy doth arise from his place, and dooth vnto him great reuerence and complementes, and so doo all the rest, acknowledging their duties.
                  Then dooth this Uisitor place himselfe in the principallest seate of counsell, and maketh his oration as the common vse is amongst them, wherein he doth giue them to vnderstande the cause of his comming, and with what care and diligence he did vse in his visitation to search out the trueth of matters: after which, with well pondred wordes, he doth laude and prayse all such as haue well executed their offices, and according thereunto he doth straight waies place them in their counsels in the higher seates, and promising them to giue the king &amp; his counsell large account of their good seruice, that they might bee rewarded according as they do deserue. Likewise he doth sharply

reprehende all such as haue neglected their bounden dueties. Then doth he read there before them all, the sentence pronounced against them, declaring in summe, all such thinges wherein he hath found them culpable, which hath caused him to pronounce that sentence against them, the which, although it be neuer so rigorous, it is foorthwith executed without any replication or appellation: for from these visitors there is no appellation.
                  All such as shalbe punished or reprehended, th
                        •
                     y do first take away from them the ensignes of Iustice, which be as I haue told you, the girdle, bonnet, or narrowe brimd hat: with the which they can neither punish nor hurt him: and if that any wil absolutely do it, he shall for the same be depriued of his office▪ and loose his head. So being cleare of these things, then do they execute the rigour of the sentence pronounced against the malefactor. But if there be any doubt in the sentence giuen, then doth he straight waies (vppon the same doubt) ordaine nine Iudges to sit vpon it, admonishing them (with the present before their eyes) to vse well their offices, wherewith hee doth charge them in the name of the king. Many times these visitors do carrie power for to reward all such as doo well execute their offices, in giuing thē roomes and offices of greater honor: so that the present and knowen reward which is done vnto the good, and the rigorous punishment for the malefactors, is the occasion that this mighty kingdome is one of the best ruled and gouerned, of any that is at this time knowen in all the world: waying the gouernment of the one, (as in many places of this historie it is expressed) and ioyne it vnto the long and great experience which we haue had in the other, and then you will say as I say. Many times these visitors do visite the colleges and schooles, such as the king hath ordained of his owne cost in euerie prouince, (as in the processe of this booke you shall vnderstand) &amp; do examine the schoollers of the same, animating them to promotion all such as doo profite themselues in their studies: and do whip and put in prison, yea and thrust them out of the schooles all such as are to the contrarie. Of all the which and of their commencing and rewardes, which is giuen vnto such as they do find sufficient, shall be at large declared vnto you in a particular chapter for the same.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XII. Of their prisons they doo vse, and the order they haue in the executing of iustice vpon the culpable.
                  EUen as the iudges and ministers are seuere and cruell in punishing, euen so they are in putting them in prisons, the which are as terrible and as cruell, with the which they doo kéepe in peace and iustice this mightie kingdome: and as there is much people, so haue they many prisons and verie great. There are in euery principal citie throughout al these prouinces, thirtéene prisons inclosed &amp; cōpassed about with high wals,Thirteene prisons in euery great cittie. and of so great largenesse within, that besides the lodgings of the kéeper and his officers, and for a garison of souldiours that are there continually: there are fish ponds, gardeines &amp; courts, whereas the prisoners do walke and recreate themselues all the day, such as are in for small matters. Likewise there are victualling houses and shops,Uictualing houses in the prisons and shops. whereas is solde all manner of such things as the prisoners doo make for to sustaine themselues: which if they did not vse, their whole substance were not sufficient for their maintenance, the time is so long that they lie there, although it be for a small matter: the occasion is for that the iudges take deliberation in their sentences: and againe their cities are great and ful of other matters. Likewise they are slowe in the execution of any sentence. So that many times it doth fall out, that men being condemned to die, doo remaine so long in prison after their condemnation, that they die with pure age, or some other sicknesse or infirmitie, or by the crueltie of the straight and asper prison. Of these thirtéene prisons aforesaide: alwayes foure of them are occupied with prisoners condemned vnto death, and in euerie one of them there is a captaine ouer one hundred souldiers which are reparted, and dooth kéepe watch and warde day and night: euery one of these condemned prisoners hath a bord tied about his necke that hangeth downe vnto his knées, a third of a yarde brode: it is made white with a certaine whiting, and written vpon it the occasion wherefore he was condemned to die. The kéeper of the prison hath a booke, wherein is written all the names of them that are condemned, and the occasion whe
                        •
                     fore: for to be accountable of them at all times when they

shalbe demaunded of him by the iudges or vizroies. They are shakled and manakled, and put in wards that do answere into the court, whereas the officers of the prison do make them to lie with their face downewarde vppon a floore made of bords for the same purpose, and do draw ouer them iron chaines, drawne through great iron rings that are placed betwixt prisoner and prisoner, wherewith they are so strait crushed that they cannot moue nor turne them from one side to another: also they doo lay on them a certaine couering of timber, wherein remaineth no more space of hollownesse, then their bodies doth make: thus are they vsed that are condemned to death. This prison is so painefull and grieuous, that many doo dispaire and kill themselues, because they cannot suffer it. In the day time they do take them forth and take off their manacles, that they may worke for to sustaine themselues▪ all such as haue nothing to maintaine themselues, nor any other that wil help them, them the king dooth giue a pittance of rice to sustaine them. Likewise they do worke what they may to better the same.
                  There is neuer no execution done vpon such as are condemned to die, but at the comming of the visiters or iudges of residence, whom they do call Chenes and Leuchis, the which do
                        •
                      make their visitation in secret (as you doo vnderstande in the chapter where I spake of them) These doe visite the prisoners and demaund a note of the names of all them that are condemned, and the cause wherefore: and although that some of their sentences are confirmed by the king and his counsell, yet they will sée them againe in the presence of these iudges that did condemne them, or such as did gouerne in their absence, for to be informed of them the faults of euerie one: whereby he may sée and vnderstand whether his sentence of condemnation bee done with iustice or not. This diligence being done, they doo choose out among them fiftie condemned men, such whose faults are most odious, and commande the iayler to put all things in order for to doo execution on them: the which being done, they do examine them a new, and looke vpon the causes and faults, to see if by any meanes they can saue them. And if they do finde in any of them any iot of discharge, they do apart them from the rest, and straightwayes command three pieces of ordinance to be shot off, which is to giue warning to bring

forth them that shalbe executed. Then againe, when they doo bring them forth, they doo a new enter in counsell, to sée if they can saue any of them: and when not, they command other three péeces of ordinance to be shot off, to cause them to be brought out into the fielde, and yet before they do breake vp their counsell, they doo turne and sée once againe all their faults, to sée if that by any meanes possible there might bee some remedie to saue them. If they do finde any, or any suspect of indicion, they do returne out of the field that person, and sende him againe to the prison. Some doo returne with an euill will, for that they had rather die at once, then for to suffer the straightnes and crueltie of the prison: In the meane time while they are perusing their causes, and concluding the same, they do cause these condemned prisoners to sit vpon heaps of ashes, and do giue them to eate. So when all yt these diligences are concluded, and they can finde no remedy to saue any of them according vnto iustice, they doo commande thrée péeces of artilery more bee shot off, then do they execute iustice according vnto their sentence giuen them.
                  The deathes that they do execute is hanging, setting vppon stakes, quartering and burning: but there is none that is burned, but such as are traitors to the king. When the last thrée of artilerie is shot off, then the belles do ring, and a great rumor is in the cittie, for that this execution is done but seldome. The day of execution all their shops are shut in, and there is none that doth worke vntill sun be set, which is after that the executed men are buried, the which is done with the companie of much people. The next day after this is done, the visitors do make the second visitation, which is of the théeues (a thing verie much abhorred amongst them: and such as they doo finde culpable, hee is whipped throughout the common stréetes with great shame, with a borde hanging about his necke (as aforesaide) whereon is written his fault: and therewith they are carried throughout the stréetes thrée or foure dayes. They do beate them on the calues of their legges, with a broade and thicke cane of foure fingers broad, and as thicke as a mans finger, the which they do lay in water before, the more for to torment them: they are bound with their hands behind them, and their faces downewards to the earth: two hangmen do execute

this whipping of them, the one at one legge and the other at the other, and it is done with so great crueltie, that after they haue giuen sixe blowes, they cannot stande vppon their féete: and many times it chanceth that with fiftie blowes they die. The most part of these théeues do die in the punishments, and many times there is whipped togither of théeues two hundred. So that with these and others that are punished in the prisons (is of a verie truth) that there do die euerie yeare in one of these principall cities of the prouince, more then sixe thousande persons. At these punishments the iudges are alwaies in presence, and for that they should not be mooued to compassion, in the meane time that execution is done, they do occupie themselues in banquettings or other pastimes.Adulterie is death. Adulteries are death, and such as do consent to be coockoldes (which is neuer founde but amongst them of the basest sort) are punished with exemplar punishments, ordained for the same.
               
               
                  CHAP. XIII. Of the characters and letters that the Chinos do vse, and of the colleges and scholes that are in this kingdome, and of other curious things.
                  IT is not from our purpose (now after that we haue told you of the gouernement of this mightie kingdome) to giue you to vnderstand how that there be great and famous philosophers, as well natural
                        •
                      
                     
                        •
                     s morall, and other things of great pollicie and curiosity: to tel you now of their characters, and the manner they haue in writing: and then of the colledges and schooles. Now vnto the first: You shall finde verie fewe in this kingdome but can both write and reade, yet haue they not the Alphabet of letters as we haue, but all that they doe write is by figures, and they are long in learning of it, and with great difficultie, for that almost euery word hath his character. They do signifie the heauen, which they do call Guant, by one carracter alone, which is this : the king whom they doo call Bontax by this  and by consequent the earth,Sixe thosand characters in writing. the sea, and the rest of the elements. They do vse more then sixe thousande characters different the one from the other: and they doo write them verie swiftly (as it

hath béene séene many times at the Philippinas, by manie Chinos that are there, and come thither daily) it is a kinde of language that is better vnderstood in writing then in speaking (as the Hebrue toongue) by reason of the certaine distinction of points that is in euery character differing the one frō the other which in speaking cannot be distinguished so easilie. Their order of writing is cleane contrarie vnto ours, for that they doo beginne their lines from aboue downewards, but in verie good order: Likewise they begin their lines at the right hande and write towards the left, contrarie vnto vs. They kéepe the verie same order in their printing as you shall vnderstande: and as may be séene this day at Rome in the Librarie of the sacred Pallace. And likewise in that which king Philip hath caused to be erected in the monasterie of saint Laurence the royall, and also in other places: in this order as I haue saide, and of their characters to the which I referre me, it is an admirable thing to consider how that in that kingdome they doo speake manie languages, the one differing from the other: yet generallie in writing they doo vnderstand one the other, &amp; in speaking not. The occasion is, for ye one figure or character vnto them all doth signifie one thing, although in the pronouncing there is difference in the vowels. The character that doth signifie a citie is this  and in their language some doo call it Leombi, and others Fu, yet both the one and the other doo vnderstand it to bée citie, the like is in all other names. And in this order doo communicate with the
                        •
                      the Iapones, Lechios those of Samatra, and those of the kingdome of Quachinchina and other borderers vnto them: whereas in their speach or language, there is no more vnderstanding then is betwixt Gréekes and Tuskanes.
                  The king hath in euerie citie colledges or schooles at his owne cost, in the which they doo learne to write, read &amp; count, as well as to studie, naturall or morall philosophie, Astrologie, lawes of the countrie, or any other curious science. They that doo teach in these schooles be such persons as excell in euerie facultie, such as may be found none better, but speciallie in writing and reading: for that there is none, although he be neuer so poore, but dooth learne to write and read, because amongst them, he is accounted infamous that cannot doo both.

Unto higher studies come a great number of students, and doo trauaile all they may possiblie to profite, for that it is the best course and surest way to obtaine the name of a Loytia, or gentleman, or other dignitie: as more plainelie shall bée shewed you in the chapter following, where the order howe they doo giue them the title Loytia shall bée spoken off: and is amongst vs after the fashion of procéeding or commencing doctor.
                  Unto the Colleges, as well Maiors as Minors, the king dooth sende euerie yéere Uis
                        •
                     ters, for to sée and vnderstande howe the studentes doo profite: and what the masters bée, with other matters touching their good gouernement. In their vsitation they doo honour in wordes those whome they finde of abilitie, animating them to perseuer in the same: and doo put in prison and punish such as they knowe to haue abilitie, and doo not profite themselues thereof: and such as haue none, nor will not learne, they put out of the Colleges that others may occupie their places that better will imploy themselues.Paper made of the filme of canes. They haue great abundance of paper, the which is made of the filme of canes, and with great facilitie: it is verie good cheape: their printed bookes are made thereof: the most part of it can be written but on the one side, for that it is so thinne:Pens made of canes. they doo not write with pennes as wée doo, made of quilles, but with pennes made of canes, and at the ende like a fine brush, like vnto a painters pensill: and although this bée their order, yet haue they amongst them excellent Scriueners, that grow thereby to bée verie rich. When they write letters vnto anie principall person, they gilde the margent of the paper, and limbe it, and they put the letter written into a purse made of the same paper all guilt and painted, the which they shut and seale, so that the letter is onely contained therein.
                  This they doo vse verie much, that although one go to visite another in person, yet they doo carrie a letter written in their sléeues, and possible there shall not bee written in the same tenne letters, and that signifieth that they doo come to kisse their handes: these things are to bée solde at the bookebinders of all sortes, as well for principall persons and men of authoritie, as for others of meaner estate, for to desire, reprehend,

or discommende: and to conclu
                        •
                     e, for all thinges that they will desire or haue néede of: yea if it bée to defie anie bodie, so that the buyer hath no more to doo, but to close it vp and seale it, so sende it whither his pleasure is. These and manie other curiosities they doo vse as you haue heard and shall heare in the discourse of this small hystorie: or at the least somewhat touched, for that the breuitie that I doo pretend and will vse, will not permit that I shoulde enter so farre for to declare at large, but to be briefe in that I shall declare.
               
               
                  CHAP. XIIII. Of the examination of such whome they preferre to the degree of Loytia, which is with vs the degree of a doctor: and howe they doo commence them, and howe they doo beare him companie.
                  THese Uisitours of whome wee haue spoken, the king and his counsaile doo sende them to vi
                        •
                     ite his prouinces: and amongest the greatest things that are giuen them in charge, is the visitation of the Colledges and schooles which the king hath in all the principall citties as is saide, the which visitour hath a particular authoritie for to commence or graduate such students as haue finished their course, and are of abilitie and sufficiencie to perfourme the same. They doo make them Gentlemen, if they bée capable of anie charge of iustice or gouernement. And for that the vse of their ceremonies is a thing woorthie to bée knowne, I will heere declare the same order which Frier Martin de Herrada, and his companions did sée in the citie of Aucheo, at the time of their commencement.
                  At such time as the visitor hath concluded the visitation of his prouince, and hath punished the malifactours, and rewarded the good: in the metropolitane cities, hée dooth straight wayes cause proclamation to bee made that all students and scholers that doo finde themselues sufficient, and haue a corage to be examined to take the degrée of Loytia, the which although

amongst them is vnderstoode to bee made a gentleman, yet amongst vs is a doctour.
                  The day appointed being come, they are all presented before the visitour, who taketh all their names in a scrowle, and appointeth another day for their examination. This day for honour of the feast, the visitor dooth inuite all the learned Loytias that are in the citie, who ioyntly with him do make the examination with great rigour, alwayes putting forwardes and preferring those that are skilfull in the lawes of the countrey, by which they do gouerne all other faculties whatsoeuer, and that they be therewithall good, and vertuous. And all those that they doo finde with these properties, they do write their names in an other scrowle, and doo appoint the day of commencement, the which is done with great ceremonies and much people, in whose presence, the visitor in the name of the king, doth giue vnto them the ensignes of degrée and dignitie to be a Loytia, that is a waste or girdle bossed with gold or siluer, and a hat with certaine thinges on it, as shall be shewed you in the chapter following: which is a signe and token that doth make the difference from the vulgar people: without the which none can shewe himselfe in publike.
                  And although al be called Loytias, I meane, those that come to it by letters or learning, and others by the warres, and others by a gift of the king, yet they differ the one from the other in estimation. For that those of the royall counsell, viceroyes, gouernors, and visitors, are made Loytias by disputation in learning. And the generall Captaines, Maiors, Bailifes and Testators, are a gift of the kinges in recompence of some good seruice that they haue done. These haue no more preheminence, but onely that they haue the benefite of their priuileges, and haue the dignitie of that vocation, but these are neuer preferred to greater honours, as the other Loytias are, of these you haue in euery citie very many.
                  There be others likewise of great estimation, and are put in the second degrée, and are those that are made by desert in the warres, and are elect and chosen by the generals, by authoritie of the king for some act or worthie déede done in the wars by force of armes or such like, approued by witnesse of great credite: vnto whom besides the title and honour giuen vnto

them, they doo giue them great liuings, for that no valiant or worthie déede but is had in estimation, and gratified with great liberalitie,Any good thing gratified. which is the occasion that those which are meane souldiors, are animated to imitate those that be most principall and valiant. According vnto my promise I will here with as much breuitie as may bee, declare vnto you the order of their commencements, and how they do accompanie them after that they are made Loytias, for that it is a thing worth the hearing.
                  The day appointed being come, for to commence or giue degrées, all the Loytias with the visitor, doo enter into the royall hall, whereas they were examined, al richly apparelled,The order of their commencement in schooles. and being assembled, then do enter in al those that shal receiue degrées, galantly apparelled without any vpper garment, and before euerie one of them, go the Padrines, and after them the Graduates with garments very finely made, riding on Gennets very sumptuously couered with cloth of gold and silke, that do carie the ensignes that shalbe giuen vnto him, the which hee dooth demande of the visitor knéeling vpon his knées with great humilitie. Who first sweare them, that in all offices committed vnto them, they shall with all care and diligence doo iustice equallie vnto all men, and that they shall not receiue 
                        •
                     anie bribes or presents whatsoeuer: that they shall be true and loyall vnto the king, and that they shall not conspire in any confederacie or treason against him, and manie other things: which ceremonies he standeth long about.
                  This oth being taken, the visitor, who presenteth the kings person, dooth put on them the ensignes aforesaide, with the facultie belonging thereunto, and then hée and all the Loytias imbrace them presently. This doone, they depart out of the hal in verie decent order, at which instant all the belles in the citie are rong, and great store of ordinance and artilerie discharged, which continueth a good space. Then they carrie these newe Loytias throughout the citie, accompanied with a multitude of people in manner following.
                  There go first before them, many souldiers, marching in good order with drommes and trompets and other musicall instruments verie melodious: after them are borne many Maces, then follow all the Loytias, some on horsebacke and some are carried in litter chaires, in most gallant order, after which follow

the Padrines. Then the new commenced Loytias, with out any vpper garment as before is saide, all mounted vppon white horses verie richly couered with cloth of Gol
                        •
                     e: hauing euerie one of them a tippet of taffeta vpon his shoulder, and on his head a hat with two small tippets hanging downe behinde, much after the fashion of those that hang on the bishops miter, this is permitted vnto none, but vnto those of their orders abouesaide: vpon their hats they haue two branches of golde or of siluer and guilt, made like vnto a bunch of fethers: Before euerie one of them are carried sixe frames, couered with 
                        •
                     atten, and euerie one is carried by foure men: in these frames are written in letters of golde, their disputation, facultie and title giuen them for the same, and their armes, with manie other things, which I omit for breuitie sake, because this marching and passing holdeth eight houres togither. The Citizens there kéepe this day festiuall, and do ordeine manie dances and sportes. And the better sort doo celebrate three or foure daies after, banquetting the newe made Loytia, and giuing him ioy of his newe preferment, euerie man seeking his good will and fauour. From this day forwards hée is of abilitie to take vppon him any office and gouernement whatsoeuer: and therefore straight wayes he goeth vnto the court, to procure the same, and carrieth with him the ensignes of his commencement, and is apparelled so that he may be knowne, wherefore they doo him great honour in the way as hee goeth, and lodge him in such houses as the king hath appointed in euerie towne for such as they be. When he commeth to the court, hee goeth and dooth his duetie vnto the president and vnto the rest of the royall counsell, who euerie one a part, doo giue him ioy of his new dignitie, and with many words of great curtesie &amp; praise, promise him, as occasion shall serue to prouide him a place, as they by their examination doo vnderstande his abilitie, and againe as they see his discréete dealing and care in such matters as they do giue him in charge, so will they preferre him to better dignitie and honour. So the next day following they register him in their booke of memorie, which is alwayes in the counsell chamber: and they remaine there waiting and seruing them vntill they haue prouided them of some gouernement (which is not long after, for that the kingdome is great

with manie prouinces and Citties, as by this historie you shal vnderstand.
               
               
                  CHAP. XV. How that with them they haue had the vse of Artilery long time before vs in these parts of Europe.
                  AMongst many things worthie to bée considered (which haue béene and shalbe declared in this historie, &amp; amongst manie other which of purpose I omit, because I would not be tedious vnto the reader, no one thing did cause so much admiracion vnto the Portugals, when that they did first traficke in Canton, neither vnto our Spaniards, who long time after went vnto the Philippinas: as to finde in this kingdome Artilerie. And wee finde by good account taken out of their histories, that they had the vse thereof long time before vs in Europe. It is said that the first beginning was in the yeare 1330. by the industrie of an Almane, yet howe he was called there is no historie that dooth make mention:The first inuenting of armor. but the Chinos saie and it is euidently séene, that this Almaine dooth not deserue the name of the first inuentor, but of the discouerer, for that they were the first inuentors, and from them hath the vse therof béene transported vnto other kingdomes, where it is nowe vsed. The Chinos saie that their first king called Vitey, did first inuent the same, and that he was taught the manner how to make them by a spirite that came out of the earth, for to defende himselfe and his kingdome from the Tartares that did much molest him with warres: for according vnto the tokens giuen him, (as it dooth appeare in their histories) and the industrie for the same, it appeareth that it was some spirit enimie vnto mankind, onely for to destroy them, as in these daies the experience thereof is apparant vnto vs. All the which carieth a similitude of the trueth, for that this king was a great sorcerer &amp; inchanter, as you may well vnderstande by the herbe that he had growing in ye court of his pallace, whereof before I haue told you. And if this be not credible because so many yeres are past since this kings raigne, yet it is of truth,Artilerie 1300. yeares before vs. yt when these Chinos went to the kingdom of Pergu, &amp; to cōquest ye east Indies more then 1500. yeares since, they caried with them ye like

instruments of warre, which did serue them in their conquest: the which conquest being ended, they left behind them certaine péeces of artilerie, which were found afterwards by the Portugals, wheron were grauen the armes of China, and in what yeare they were made, agréeing iust with the time, of the conquest.
                  Such Artilerie as the Frier Gerrada, and his companions did sée at their being there, they say it was of antiquitie, and very ill wrought, and was for the most part péeces to shoote stones, or murderers: but it was giuen them to vnderstande that in other prouinces of the kingdome, there be that bee verie curiouslie wrought and faire: which may bée of such which the Captaine Artieda did sée: who in a letter that hee wrote vnto king Phillip, giuing him to vnderstande of the secreats of this countrie, amongst which hee saide, the Chinos doo vse all armour as wee doo, and the artilerie which they haue is excellent good. I am of that opinion, for that I haue séene vessels there of huge greatnesse, and better made then ours, and more stronger.
                  In euerie Citie they haue certaine houses where they make their ordinance, and artilerie continuallie: they doo not plant them on Castles (for that they haue not the vse of them in all the kingdome) but vppon the gates of their cities, which hath mightie great and thicke walles, and déepe ditches, which they doo fill with water out of the next riuer at all times when néede requireth, which they account the greatest strength in all the kingdome. At euerie gate of the Citie there is a Captaine with manie souldiours, that keepeth watch and warde, night and daie, to suffer no stranger to enter in without especiall lycence of the gouernour of the Citie or towne. By this that I haue alredie saide, as seemeth vnto mée, is apparantlie shewed and declared the antiquitie of Artilerie in this kingdome: and howe that they there were the first inuenters thereof. Likewise it dooth plainely appéere that there was the first inuention of printing, a thing as strange as the other, whose antiquitie in that kingdome, shalbe shewed in the Chapter following.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XVI. Of the antiquitie and manner of printing of bookes, vsed in this kingdome, long before the vse in our Europe.
                  THe admirable inuention, and the subtill ingenie of printing is such, that for lacke of the vse thereof, should haue béene forgotten the worthinesse of manie excellent men, and of their déedes doone in the happie daies and times long past: and manie in these our daies woulde not trouble themselues so much as they doo, in learning to get honour and promotion, or in feates of warres, if that their fame should no longer continue in writing then their liues on the earth. Leauing apart the woonderfull effectes of this subtile inuention, least speaking thereof I shoulde be ouer tedious, I will heere onelie goe about to prooue that which this Chapter dooth propounde, with some ensamples, whereof manie are found in their histories, and likewise in ours. It doth plainelie appeare by the vulgar opinion, that the inuention of printing did beginne in Europe in the yeare 1458. the which was attributed vnto Toscan called Iohn Cutembergo: and it was saide of trueth, that the first mould wherewith they doo print was made in Maguncia, from whence an Almaine called Conrado did bring the same inuention into Italie: And the first booke that was printed, was that which saint Austine did write, intituled De ciuitate Dei: wherein manie authors agrée. But the Chinos doo affirme, that the first beginning was in their countrie, and the inuentour was a man, whome they reuerence for a saint: whereby it is euident that manie yeares after that they had the vse therof, it was brought into Almaine by the way of Ruscia and Moscouia, from whence, as it is certaine, they may come by lande, and that some merchants that came from thence into this kingdome, by the redde sea, and from Arabia Felix, might bring some 
                        •
                     ooks, from whence this Iohn Cutembergo, whom the histories dooth make authour) had his first foundation. The which béeing of a trueth, as they hau
                        •
                      authoritie for the same, it dooth plainelie appeare that this inuention came

from them vnto vs: and for the better credite heereof, at this day there are found amongst them many bookes printed 500. yeares before the inuention began in Almanie: of the which I haue one, and I haue séene others, as well in Spaine and in Italie as in the Indies. The Frier Herrada and his companions, when they came from the China vnto the Philippinas did bring with them manie printed bookes of diuers matters, which they did buy in the Citie of Aucheo, the which were printed in diuers places of the kingdome. Yet the most part of them were printed in the prouince of Ochian, whereas is the best print: and as they did report they woulde haue brought a great number more, if that the vizroy had not disturbed them, for they haue great libraries, and very good cheape, but hée suspected that those bookes might be a meane to giue them to vnderstande the secrets of their kingdome, the which they doo indeuour to kéepe close from strangers. The vizroy vsed a policie, and sent them word, how that he was certified, that they went about buying of bookes for to carry them into their countrie, and howe they shoulde not spende their many on them, for hée woulde giue them for nothing so manie bookes as they woulde haue, which afterward hée did not performe, possible for the reason aforesaide, or else he did forget his promise,
                  At such time as this commandement came vnto them, they had bought a good number, out of the which are taken the most things that wée haue put in this small historie, for to giue a briefe notice of them, and of that kingdome till such time as by a true certificate the experience of manie shall cause more credite thereunto: for that vnto this day, by reason of the small notice wée haue, we cannot with so great authoritie make it so credible, as wee hope that time hereafter will doo. The which hath mooued mee, yea and constrained me to leaue to intreat of manie things, which in those parts are to bée credited, yea and are most true: and for the same I haue béene blamed and reprehended by such as haue had perfite notice thereof.
                  And nowe for that I will not go from my purpose, you shall vnderstand in the Chapter following▪ whereof these bookes that they brought doo intreat, that the better you may giue

credite vnto the curiositie and policie of that kingdome, as in manie places I haue declared and hereafter will declare.

                  CHAP. XVIII. The order that these Chinos obserue in making bankets, and in celebrating their festiuall daies.
                  FOr that in some parts of this historie wee haue touched the bankets that the Chinos do make, it shall not bee amisse to declare here the order they vse therein, for that they are curious, and differ verie much from our order and vse in their banquetting, the which we haue perceiued as well by their féeding as by many other thinges.
                  Amongest these Chinos, more than amongest any other people of the world, are vsed bankets and feastes, for they are rich and without care, and also without the light of heauen, albeit they do confesse and beléeue the immortalitie of the soule, and the rewarde or punishment in an other worlde, according vnto their workes in this life (as we haue saide,) all that euer they can, they doo giue themselues vnto the contentment of the flesh, and vnto all maner pastimes, wherein they liue most delicately, and in verie good order. Their custome is, although

they haue a hundred guestes, yet euerie one must sit and eate at a table by himselfe. Their tables be verie fine, gilt and painted full of birdes and beastes, and other varieties verie pleasant vnto the eye. They doo not vse to put table clothes on them: but onely a forefront of damaske, or some other silke on euerie one of them, which hangeth downe to the ground, and on the foure corners they doo sette manie little baskettes curiously wrought with golde and siluer wyer, full of flowers and knackes of sugar, made with great curiositie, as Elefantes, grayhoundes, hares, and all other kinde of beastes and foules, gylt and painted: in the middest of the table they doo sette the victualles in maruelous good order, as 
                        •
                     lesh of diuerse sortes, fowle, and fishes: of the which they make diuerse manners of brothes passing well dressed, and are serued in fine earthen dishes of great curiositie and of siluer, (although these they vse verie seeldome, except for the viceroyes:) they haue no neede of table clothes nor napkins, for they eate so delicately, that they doo not touch the meate with their handes, but with little forkes of golde or siluer, with the which they eate so cleanly, that although it be verie small that they eate, yet will they let nothing fall: they drinke often, but a little at a time, and therefore they vse verie little cuppes.
                  At these bankettes and feastes, there are present alwayes women gesters, who doo play and sing, vsing manie prettie gestes to cause delight, and make mirth to the guestes: besides these they haue diuerse sortes of men with other instruments, as tomblers and players, who doo represent their Comedies verie perfectly and naturally: in these bankets they spende the greatest part of the day, by reason of so manie diuersities of meates that they serue in. They passe many times a hundreth sundrie dishes, when that the estate of the person that is inuited, or of him that maketh the banket dooth require. As may shew the report of the Augustine Fryers in the beginning of the second part of this historie: where one doth tell of bankets that were made him by the Insuanto, a Gouernor of the prouince of Chincheo, and the Uiceroy of Aucheo, and of the gallant deuises they had to driue away the time so long as the banket lasted. Unto euerie one of their guestes they doo set a table,

euerie table standing one along by an other, making a difference of the number of them according vnto the qualitie of the persons: vpon the first table (where sitteth he that is inuited) they set the victual
                        •
                     es readie dressed, swéete meates, or marchpanes, which is the last seruice: and on the rest, although they be twentie, they set great store of diuerse kindes of meates, all rawe, as capons, duckes, teales, hennes, peeces of salt &amp; martlemas biefe, gammons of bacon, and many other thinges. All these doo remaine vppon the tables till the banket be ended, and the guestes departed: then doo the seruantes of him that made the banket, take all these rawe meates, and carrie them before their guestes till they come vnto their houses or lodges, where they doo leaue it with great ceremonies. When they do make any banket to a viceroy or to any Embassadour, it is with so great cost and sumptuousnes that they spend a great substance therein. These bankets do commonly indure twentie daies together, continuing vntill the last day as royally and as plentifully as at the first day.
                  They do celebrate all their festiual dayes in the night▪ which is ordinarily their newe moones, and they doo solemnise them with much musicke, and newe inuentions. But more particularly they doo celebrate the first day of the yeare, which is after their account, the first day of the moneth of March: on this day they apparell themselues verie costlye and sumptuouslie, both men and women, and doo adorne themselues with all their iewelles and newe toyes, and doo hang their houses and doores, with carpettes and clothes of silke and cloth of golde, and dresse them vppe trimme with Roses, and other flowers, for at that time there is great store in that Countrey: likewise they doo sette at all their doores great trées, on the which they doo hang manye lightes, and all the triumphall arckes that bee in the streetes (which bee verye manie as wee haue sayde) are decked with bowes this day: wherein they put manie lightes, and set full of canapies of cloth of gold, damaske, and manie other sundrie sorts of sil
                        •
                     es.
                  Their Priestes doo assist them in these 
                        •
                     eastes very richly apparelled, and doo offer sacrifice vpon their altars vnto the heauen, and vnto their idolles, and they sing many songes.
                  
                     This day dooth all people generally sport themselues with great singing and sounding of instruments, in the which they are very cunning. Such instruments as the Augustine fryers did sée, were lutes, gytternes, vyalles, rebbukes, wayghtes, virginalles, harpes and flutes, and other instrumentes which we doo vse, although they doo differ something in the fashion of them, but yet easie to be knowen. They do tune their voyces vnto their instrumentes with great admiration: they haue all commonly very good voyces. In these feasts they do make many representations of great pastime according vnto nature, with vestimentes that they haue for the purpose. All the dayes that these feastes do indure, their tables be full of diuerse sorts of meates, as well of fish as of flesh, and of all sortes of fruites, and excellent good wine, the which they make of the palme trée with certaine mixtures, which maketh it haue an excellent good taste. All the day they and their Priestes do eate &amp; drinke so much till they can no more. They haue it for a thing most certaine amongest them, that looke how they are in disposition that day, so shall they passe the whole yeare, eyther sorrowfull or merrie. I omit the feastes which they make at mariages, and at any good successe, though they be in great number and very sumptuous, because I would not be tedious: in all things they couet to auoyde melancholy.
               
               
                  CHAP. XIX. How they salute one an other in this countrie, and of some part of their ceremonies.
                  THere is no nation in all the worlde, be it neuer so barbarous that hath béene found out vntill this day, without a maner of courtesie, or some ceremony of salutatiō in their méetinges and visitinges, or when they do assemble in any particular businesse: whereof wee haue large notice by auncient histories, and sufficient experience in that wee haue séene and vnderstoode in these kingdomes and prouinces which in our dayes hath béene discouered: although herein (as I am fully perswaded) those of this kingdome do excéede all nations of the world (as is affirmed by them that haue had the experience) for they haue so many ceremonies and vsages of courtesie and

ciuilitie amongest them
                        •
                     , that they haue bookes to teach them only how they should behaue themselues in making difference of persons. Of all the which, such as shall séeme expedient to giue notice of, I will declare in this chapter, vsing therein the breuitie that this historie requireth.
                  They estéeme it a great discourtes
                        •
                     e, not to salute one an other whē they sée or meete one an other, although the acquaintance betwixt them be but small.
                  The salutation that the common people do vse, is when they do meete the one with the other, to shut the left hande, and to couer it with the right, ioyning therewith their breastes together, with much bowing their heades downewardes, signifying, that loue and amitie is as firme betwéene them as their handes are fast. And that their friendshippe is not alonely in the ceremonie but also in the heart: the which they giue them to vnderstande by woordes, at the same time. But amongest Courtyers and Gentlemen they vse an other manner of courtesie, which seemeth vnto them of much more curiositie, that is: at such time as they doo meete, they make a little staye, then they cast abroad their armes, and claspe their fingers together remayning in compasse, humbling themselues manie times and contending one with an other about their parting for to prosecute his waye, and the higher estate they are of, the more is their contention. When that anie meane person doth meete with a principall man, who for dignitie or for any other occasion dooth acknowledge superioritie, straight wayes hee dooth stay with great silence, declining his head till such time as he is past by, although the most part of them dooth it more for feare than for courtesie: for that experience hath taught them, that he that dooth it not, is straightwayes punished and whipped cruelly.
                  When that any of these commeth to speake with any Loytia, at the entring in at the hall whereas he is, 
                        •
                     hee knéeleth downe, declyning his head and looking vpon the ground: and on this sort he goeth vpon his knees till hee come into the middest of the hall, and there he stayeth and declareth his petition by worde of mouth with an humble and méeke voyce, or else presenteth it by writing: and hauing receiued aunswere, hee dooth returne on his knées backwardes without turning his

backe to the Loytia vntill hee bee quite out of the hall. And if they which do méete or visite one an other be equall in dignity, they shew great courtesie on both sides, contending who shall surpasse in courtesie and wordes: wherein they are verie ceremonious. When one doth goe to visite an other, he that is visited, after the visitation done, doth bring the other vnto the stréete doore. This custome is vsed most amongest the common people being equall in degrée, or differing little. Likewise they vse one thing verie strange, and neuer heard of amongest other nations, that is: if that one doo come out of the countrie to visite an other that is in the citie or towne (although he be a nigh kinsman and long time acquainted) if that knocking at the doore or in the stréete hee doo meete with him whome he dooth come to visite (hee beeing not well apparelled) although he speake vnto him,A strange kind of courtesie. yet will hee not make any aunswere nor any resemblance that euer he sawe or knewe him before: but straightwayes returneth home to his house in all ha
                        •
                     te possible, and doth apparell him selfe with the best apparell that he hath, and then he goeth foorth and receiueth his guest and friend, dissembling as though he had not before méete nor séene him.
                  This Ceremonie amongest them is infalliblie kept, for that it is amongest them an auncient tradition and founded vppon their religion. They giue great intertainement vnto their guestes, and make them straightwayes a beuer or collation with manie sortes of conserues and fruites, and good wine, and an other kinde of drinke that is generally vsed thorough out the whole kingdome, and is made of diuerse physicall hearbes good to comfort the heart, the which they warme when they drinke thereof.
                  These Ceremonies they vse when that one neighbour dooth visite an other. But when that one of the Towne dooth meete with a stranger that hee dooth knowe and hath beene in the towne certaine dayes, and he not séene him: then hee of the towne dooth aske of the other if that hee hath eaten any thing, if he aunswere no: he dooth by and by without any delay, carrie him to the next victualling house, whereas hee dooth banket him deliciously: for in euerie towne, there is good opportunitie for the same, by reason that in

the market places and stréetes, and in the suburbes there is great store of victualling houses, that doo kéepe tabling verie orde
                        •
                     ly, and for little cost: for there (as we haue sayde) all kinde of victualles are verie good cheape. But if the stranger dooth aunswere that he hath eaten, then dooth the Citizen or townesman, carrie him to an other kinde of victtualing houses, where are to be had all sortes of conserues and iunkettes, fruites and marchpanes, and there dooth hee make him a banket with great loue and good will. Of the women as well strangers as towneborne, or of what degrée soeuer, they haue great respect, but especially of the married women: vnto whome if any man giue an ill or dishonest woorde, he is accounted infamous: and likewise if he doo not offer to them courtesie, and giue them place or way when they passe the stréetes, which is seeldome séene. But when they doo passe, they behaue themselues so discreetly that they giue no occasion that anye shoulde misuse them: towardes strangers they vse verye great courtesie: but especially the principallest: as you shall perceiue in the relation of the seconde part of this historie, where it shall be declared by experience.
               
               
                  CHAP. XX. Of the great closenesse that the women of this kingdome do liue in, and with what condition they permit common women.
                  THe principall intent that this king &amp; his gouernors haue, as is gathered by their lawes, is to preserue their common weale from vices: for the which he dooth set downe great penalties, &amp; executeth the same without any remission, and least any should offend they vse great vigilancie: and do iudge that the libertie and dishonestie of the women is most preiudiciall thereunto, &amp; is the occasion that their common wealth falleth to decay, being neuer so well gouerned: therefore they haue ordained many preseruatiues and remedies by their lawes &amp; customes to preuent the same, which is the only occasion (that although it is so long since this kingdome first began, and againe being so great as you may vnderstande,) yet in this one point

there is lesse inconuenience or preiudice than in any other countrey of lesse antiquitie and fewer people. So that a dishonest woman is knowen by name, although it be in a great citie, the which is seldome séene, and a rare thing. And the best way they haue to preuent this, is: that all people that haue daughters are commaunded by expresse order, that they shall bring them vp (after they haue the vse of reason) in their owne houses very close, and not be seene, but alwayes to doo something to auoide idlenesse, for that it is the mother of all vices, whereby it may take no roo
                        •
                     e in them. This lawe dooth comprehende married women, and is kept in such sort, that the wiues of the viceroyes and gouernours do obserue it, yea they say that the Quéenes themselues doo obserue it: and that they are alwayes spinning golde, silke or flaxe, or doing some other exercise with their handes, esteeming all idle persons woorthie to be hated and contemned: so that the children being brought vp in this manner, seeing the good example of their mothers, is the occasion that this vertuous exercise worthie to be imitated, is conuerted vnto a dayly and perpetuall custome, in such sort, that they thinke it a perpetuall torment to commaunde them to be idle. These ordinarie and voluntarie exercises haue the women of this kingdome in such sort, that it is newes and a strange thing to meete a woman in the streetes of any citie or towne, neither at the windowes, which is a signe that they liue honest. If it so fall out that of force they must go abroad, as to the buriall of parents and kinsfolkes, or to visite any one being sicke, or vpon any like occasion, then are they carried in litt
                        •
                     r chaires where they are seene of none, as we told you before: but other superfluous visitations or méetings of gossips are not there vsed. Albeit tendering the conseruation of this honest crewe, and to eschewe greater euils in the common wealth, they permit common women as a necessarie thing: yet they do allowe them in such sort, that their euill example may not be hurtfull vnto the honest state of thē which liue chast. And therfore they do build for them houses out of the cities and townes in the suburbes, giuing them straight commandement there to remaine in the said houses, &amp; not to s
                        •
                     raggle &amp; go abroad at all. And whilest they liue there they are prohibited vppon paine of death to enter into the gates of the Citie or any part thereof.
                  
                     Such women as doo vse this facultie, are nothing estéemed amongst them, for they are for the most part of the basest sort: as strangers, slaues, or such as haue béene bought of their mothers being yoonge, which is a kinde of perpetuall bondage, yea a great crueltie which is vsed amongst them there, and yet suffered amongst them. You shall vnderstande that such as are poore widowes, and driuen by necessitie, cannot sustaine themselues, they may for the supplying of their want, sell their children and binde them to perpetuall seruitude, the which is permitted in such sort, that there are amongst them rich merchants that deale in no other thing: and all the maiden children that they buy so▪ bee brought vp with great care, and taught to plaie and sing, and other things appertaining vnto pleasure. Then after, when they are of yeares, they carrie 
                        •
                     hem vnto the houses aforesaid ordained for common women. The first day that they doo dedicate her to this ill office, before shée is put into this common house, they carrie her before a iudge, which the king hath ordained for euerie house appertaining to any cittie or towne, appointed to bée their kéeper, and sée that there bee no euill rule kept amongst them: and this iudge dooth place her in the house himselfe, and from that day forwards her master hath no more to doo with her, but to go euerie moneth vnto the iudge to recouer his tribute, which is a certaine summe set downe by the iudge, by agréement made betwene them both, &amp; he appointeth besides this the time when hée shall be paide for her, and for that was spent in her bringing vp and teaching.
                  These women be very much haunted, and passe away the time maruellous pleasantly by reason of their singing and playing, which they doo with great cunning: and according vnto the report of the Chinos, they apparell themselues with great curiositie, and paint themselues. They haue amongst them many blinde women, that are frée and not bonde: these are trimmed, dressed and painted by others that haue their sight, and such as haue spent all their youth in these houses, can not goe foorth so long as they liue, as is commaunded by a lawe publike, least by their dishonest demeanure they should be an occasion of some harme and an euill example to others. Whatsoeuer pro
                        •
                     ite dooth remaine vnto these women

when they haue payed their maister they giue vnto the Iudge their superiour, who doth keepe it faithfully and carefully, and giueth a good account thereof euerie yeare vnto the Uisitors. And afterwardes when these women waxe olde, it is repa
                        •
                     ed vnto them againe by order of the said Iudge. But it is bestowed in such sort, that they shall not lacke: neither haue vrgent necessitie. But if it so fall out that they should lacke, they will giue them a stipend to maintaine them, onely for to dresse and trimme the blinde women, or else they will put them into the kinges hospitall, a place ordeyned for such as can not helpe themselues.
                  The men children which they buy, and are solde to supplie their necessitie, in the order aforesaide, of the women, they put to learne some occupation, and after that they are expert therein, they doo serue a master in the same trade for a certaine time: the which being expired, their masters are not only bound to giue them their libertie, but also to prouide them of wiues and to marrie them, prouiding also for them houses, and necessaries wherewith they may get their liuing. Which if they doo not of their owne frée will, they are compelled by Iustice to doo, whether they will or no. And they for a token of gratefulnesse must come vnto their masters the first day of the yeare, and other dayes appointed and bring him some present. The children of these be all frée, and subiect to no bondage for the benefite

                  CHAP. XXI. The fashion of their ships, aswell of those that passe the seas, as of those that doo roade riuers, which are manie and great: and howe they doo prouide themselues of fish for all the yeare.
                  THere is in this kingdome a great number of shippes and barkes, with the which they sayle all a long their coastes, and vnto Ilandes neere hande, and into their riuers, the which doo runne cleane through the most part of all their prouinces: and there dwelleth so much people vpon these riuers in shippes and barkes, that it séemeth to be some great Citie,

there is so many of thē, that they do esteeme that there is almost as many people that dwell vpon the water, as vpon the lande.
                  They make them slightly and with small cost, for they haue in all partes of this countrie great aboundance of tymber, iron, and other thinges necessarie for this vse: but in especiall a kinde of glew, wherewith they doo 
                        •
                     awbe and trimme their shippes, that is much more tougher and stronger then the pitch which wee vse, which after it is layde on, sticketh fast and maketh their shipping as harde as stones: the aboundance whereof, and the great number of shipwrightes, and againe for that there is not on the lande roome enough for the people to inhabite, being so many in number, causeth them to build so great a number of shippes and barkes. They vse their shippes and barkes of many fashions, euery one hath his proper name. Such ships as they haue to saile long voiages be called, Iuncos but for the warre they make huge &amp; mightie vessels, with high castles, both on the prowe and sterne, much after the fashion of them that come out of the Easterne seas, and vnto those with which the Portingales sayle into the east India. They haue these in so great number, yt a generall may ioine together in 4. dayes an armie of more than 600. Those which they do commonly vse for burden and to lade, are made much after ye same fashion &amp; greatnes, and smal difference there is betwéene them, but that they are lower both before &amp; at the sterne. There is an other sort of lesser vessels, &amp; are much like vnto p
                        •
                     nases, &amp; haue foure great ores on ech side, whereat row sixe men at euery ore &amp; foure at the least. These are excellent good to rowe in and out ouer their hard hauens, or into any place where is litle water, they do call thē 
                     Bancoens. There is an other sort that is more brode than these, which they call Lanteas, &amp; carie eight ores on a side, with sixe men at euerie ore. Of these two last sorts of vessels pirates &amp; rouers at the sea do cōmonly vse (for in those seas there be very many) for that they be very nimble to fly &amp; to giue assalt as occasion doth serue. They haue an other sort of vessels yt are long like vnto a galley, but more square being very brode &amp; néede little water: they do vse thē likewise to transport merchandise frō one place to an other: they are swift &amp; run vp the riuers with smal force of the armes. Many other sorts of barks they haue, besides the aforesaid, some with galleries &amp; windows

painted and gylt, but chiefely those which the Uiceroyes and Gouernours doo make for their recreation. Of those sortes of shipping afore sayd, which they call Iuncos, the king hath in al his prouinces great armies, and in them souldiers with their Captaines to defend the coastes, that as well all ships of their owne Countrie, as those that doo come from other places to traficke with them, may goe and come in safetie, and not bee spoyled and robbed of the roauers that be there abouts. In the riuers there are pynases well equipped appointed for the same purpose. And the king doth out of his rentes pay all these ordinarie souldiers, and that with great liberalitie.
                  The pitch wherewith they doo trimme their shippes (as we haue sayde) is founde in that kingdome in great aboundance, it is called in their language, Iapez: and is made of lyme, oyle of fish, and a paste which they call Vname: it is verie strong and suffereth no wormes, which is the occasion that one of their shippes dooth twise out last one of ours: yet dooth it hinder much their sayling. The pumpes which they haue in their shippes are much differing from ours, and are farre better: they make them of many péeces, with a whéele to draw water, which whéele is set along the shippes sides within, wherewith they do easily clense their shippes, for that one man alone going in the wheele, doth in a quarter of an houre, cleanse a great shippe, although she leake verie much.
                  Many men be borne and brought vp in these shippes and barkes (as is aforesayde) and neuer in all their liues haue béene on lande, and doo knowe none other occupation wherewith to liue, but that which they doo inherite of their fathers, which is to goe in one of these shippes or barkes, carrying and recarrying of merchandise from place to place, or to ferrie people ouer the riuers. They haue in them their wiues &amp; their children, and haue like neighborhood amongst thē on the riuers, as in their cities and townes, of whom they stand in little néed for they do bring vp within their ships all things necessarie for their sustenance, as hens, duckes, pigeons, and other foules good to be eaten: and if they do lacke any thing, they haue it in victualing houses &amp; shops which they haue amongst thē on the same riuers in great abundance: and of other superfluous thinges such as may bee founde in a citie, they are well furnished:

as of many sorts of silkes, amber and muske, and other things more curious then needefull. They haue also in their shippes, pots with little orange trées and other fruits, and gardins with flowers, and other herbes for their recreation, and in the wide shippes pooles of water, wherein they haue great store of fish aliue, and yet doo dayly fishe for more with nettes. This kingdome is the best prouided of fish of any that is knowen, by reason of the great number of these barkes, as also because they haue many fisher men at Sea and in the riuers, that continually fish with nettes, and other engines for the same purpose: and doo carrie the same fishe (in infinite number) aliue into their pooles fiue hundreth leagues vp into the lande by the riuers, which they doo with great ease in shifting the water euerie day, and doo féede them with thinges fit for the nature of the fish.
                  The chiefe and principallest time of fishing in this countrie, is in three moneths of the yeare, which is, Februarie, March, and Aprill, at such time as are the spring tides, which do bring the fish out of the mayne sea into the riuers, and there they do spawne and leaue their young: then these fisher men, who doo liue by that facultie, doo take them, and put them into their pondes, and féede and nourish them in the ships till they come to bignesse to be solde.
                  Unto these fishermen repayre many barkes, from diuerse partes of the Countrie to buye their fishe, and doo bringe with them wicker baskets lyned with a certaine thicke paper for that purpose, and annoynted with oyle, so that the water can not goe out: wherein they doo put their fish, and do shift them euerie day, and feede them as aforesaide. All people doo buye of this fish, although they bee verie small and leane, and doo put them in their pondes which euerie one hath in his house (as common vse in all that countrie is) whereas in a small time they waxe great, fitte to be eaten. They doo féede them with a paste made of cowes doung, buffes doung, and pigins doong.
                  Likewise they doo throwe of these small fishes into the mo
                        •
                     tes of their Cities, which is the occasion that they are so full of fish. But all that bréede in them do appertaine vnto the Gouernors or Iudges of the cities, so that none without their

expresse commandement dare fish for them. These Gouernors and Iudges doo vse much to recreate themselues vppon the riuers, and haue for the same purpose barkes made close, &amp; chambers in them verie curiously wrought, with windowes and galleries likewise hanged with rich clothes, and many other thinges for their contentment and pleasure.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXII. A curious order that these Chinos haue to bring vp ducks in great abundance, and with small cost: and of a pleasant and ingenious order of fishing which they vse.
                  THe great number of people that is in this countrie, and not permitting any idle people to liue therein, is the occasion that it doth stirre vp the wits of poore men (being constrained thereunto by necessitie, the inuenter of manye thinges) to séeke new inuentions to get their liuing, to relieue and supply their necessities. So that many of this kingdome, séeing the whole countrie so throughly inhabited &amp; tilled, that there is not one foote without an owner, they do take them vnto the riuers, (which are verie great) and there they do make their dwellinges in ships and barkes (as is aforesaide,) where they haue their whole families vnder borde to defende them from the sunne and rayne, and inclinations of the heauens. There they do vse the occupation that they do knowe, or that which they did inherite of their father, and many misteries to liue by, verie strange: whereof the most principall is to bring vp in some of their barkes so great quantitie of duckes, that they sustaine a great part of the countrey therewith, and the vse thereof is as followeth.
                  They haue cages made of canes so bigge as the vpper most holde of the barke, in the which may be foure thousand duckes at once. They haue in certaine places of these cages made nestes where these duckes do almost euerie day laye egges, the which they take: and if it be in the sommer they doo put them in buffes doong, or in the doong of those duckes, which is verie warme, where they leaue them so many dayes, as experience hath taught them, that they will come foorth. Then they doo take them out of the doong, and do breake them one by one and

take a little ducklin, the which they do with so great cunning▪ that almost none of thē doth perish, which is yt which causeth great admiration vnto some that go to sée it: although they bée but few, for that it is an auncient custome vsed of long time in that countrie. And for to haue the fruition of this benefite all the yeare, in the winter they must vse an artificiall helpe to giue a little warmenes vnto the doong for the bringing forth of their egs, they do vse thē an other inuentiō as ingenious as the first, &amp; that is this: they take a great number of canes tied one by another, whereon they do laye the doong, then vppon that they doo lay their egges, and do couer them verie well with the same: this being done they put vnder the canes, straw, or some other like thing, and set it on fire, but in such sort that it dooth not burne, but kéepeth a naturall heat, all the time till they thinke that they are readie to be taken out. Then doo they take and breake them, as aforesaide, so that their pultrie dooth increase in such number as though they were antes. Then doo they put thē into an other cage for the same purpose, wheras be old duckes brought vp for no other purpose, but to couer the little ones vnder their winges and kéepe them warme: and there they doo féede them euery day till such time as they can féede themselues, and go abroad into the fieldes to profit themselues in the companie of the olde duckes. Many times they haue in number aboue twentie thousand, yet do they maintain them with a small-cost, and it is in this order: euerie morning they do giue them a small quantitie of boyled rice, then do they open a doore of the cage, which is towardes the riuer, and doo put a bridge of canes that doth reach vnto the water: then doo they come foorth with so great haste one vpon an other, that it is a pastime to sée them. All the day after they do passe the time vpon the water, and in the fieldes of rice vpon the land, wheras they do féede: the owners of the rice doo giue vnto the owners of the duckes somewhat to let their duckes go into their fields, for that they do destroy all the grasse and other wéeds in it. And hurt nothing of the rice.
                  When that the euening draweth on, then they of the barke do make a sound with a taber or such like, yt which being heard of his duckes, they throwe thēselues with great spéede into the water, and swimme straight vnto their owne barke, whereas

their bridge is readie put for them, and euerie flocke doth know his owne barke by the sounde without missing at any time, although there be many flockes together. For euerie barke doth vse a different sound the one from the other, to the which the duckes are vsed, and their eares full thereof, so that they neuer fayle their owne barke.
                  This manner of liuing is greatly vsed in all that countrie and verie profitable, for that it is a victuall most vsed amongst them, and is esteemed as a thing of great sustentation and of small price, by reason that at al times there is bréeding of them and of small cost.
                  Likewise in this Countrey they doo vse a kinde of fishing, that is of no lesse industrie, then the bringing vppe of these duckes, and a thing to be séene. The king hath in euerie Citie founded vppon the riuers, houses, wherein euerie yeare is brought vp many Cormorantes, or sea Rauens, with whome they doo fishe, in those monethes that the fish dooth spawne and that is in this maner following. They take the Cormorantes out of their cages, and carrie them vnto the riuer side, whereas they haue many barkes ordeyned for their fishing, and they are halfe full of water. Then they take their Cormorantes, and with a corde, they doo binde their mawes, in such sort, that no fish can fall into it: then they do cast them into the riuer to fish, the which they do with such good will and couetousnesse, that it is a woonder to sée, they throwe themselues into the water with great swiftnesse, and diue, whereas they do fill their throate with fish. Then they come foorth and with the like hast they go vnto the barkes that are halfe ful of water, and the fish which they haue taken they put in that water which is put there for that purpose that the fish may not die, the which being done they returne againe vnto their fishing as they did before.
                  In this order they do indure their fishing foure houres together, in such sort, that the one doth not trouble the other, and when yt their boates with water are ful of fish, then do they vnbind them, and turne them againe into the riuer for to fish for themselues, for they haue neede thereof, for that alwayes the day before that they will fish, they kéepe thē from their ordinarie victualles, which is a litle Millio that they may ye better do

their office. So after a while that they haue filled their bellies and recreated themselues, they take them out of the water and carrie them vnto the ordinarie places, whereas they art kept, and euerie third day during the time of this fishing, they doo take them forth for the same exercise, which for them is so great pastime, that they would it should indure all the yeare.
                  In these thrée monethes they do take so much fish, that they do prouide the whole kingdome for all the yeare: as in the chapter past it hath béene tolde you, which is the occasion that they are as well prouided of fish, as of any other thing: so that if they please, they may eate euerie day fresh fish, although they are farre from the sea.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXIII. Of the curtesie that the king of this mightie kingdome doth vnto the Ambassadors that come to him from anie other king, prince, or comonaltie.
                  WE should in the chapter following intreate of the ambassage that king Philip of Spaine, with the Christian zeale that he had, to sende vnto the king of this kingdome, who being mooued by certaine causes and reasons, did referre it till a better occasion, and we do beléeue that it will be offered shortly. Therefore now it shall not be from our purpose to declare in this chapter the honour and curtesie that this king doth vnto the ambassadours of kings, princes, or any other prouince that doth come vnto him in what sort so euer it be, and for that it is of great curiositie, it shall be necessarie to declare it with the circumstance wherewith it is done.
                  All such as doo enter into this kingdome, with the title of ambassadour, be it from a king, that is a friend or enimie: they are respected, intreated and made of, with so great care and diligence, as though they came themselues in person that doo send them: Unto whome, besides the obseruing the law of nations which is obserued &amp; kept among all kings in the worlde, in especiall that their persons shall not receiue neither incurre any danger, although their ambassage bringeth discontent, or harme vnto the king, besides all the which there is granted vnto them great and particular priuiledges. When that he doth

enter into the kingdome by any of the prouinces whatsoeuer. The iudge or gouernor of the first towne dooth in person go forth to méete and receiue him, and giue him his welcome, with great complement of words &amp; c

                     remonies: all the Loytias, Captaines, souldiers and the inhabitants of the towne, doo accompanie the iudge or gouernour, when that they go to receiue him. But at his disembarking to come a shore they will not suffer him to set his féete vppon the ground (although it be but a little way that he should go) but hath at the waters side in a readinesse eight men, with a chaire made of yuorie, or of some other pretious thing, with the curteines of velu
                        •
                     t, damaske, or cloth of golde: which for the like oportunitie, they haue in euerie cittie or principall towne appointed by the king, wherein they do carrie him to his lodging. Likewise they haue in euerie citie and great towne throughout all the kingdome, a principall house, and sufficient for to lodge such like personages. It is also vsed to lodge such iudges as are sent by the king to execute his commandement when they passe by anie of such cities or townes. There is in euery one of these houses a Lieutenant, &amp; he hath in it maruellous and excellent houshold stuffe, as hangings, beddes, seruants, and all other necessaries, not 
                        〈◊〉
                      to lodge one ambassador, but many if they shoulde there méete, and not one to disturbe an other. So as aforesaide, they doo beare him company (either on horsebacke, or in a chaire, which is the ordinarie carriage amongst them) till hee come vnto this house, whereas they doo leaue him with much curtesie and many ceremonies, alonelie with them that waite vppon him and serue him. And also a Captaine with a thousand or two thousande souldiers for to garde him continuallie, and to beare him companie till hee returne againe out of the kingdome. Then the next day following the iudge or gouernour that did receiue him dooth go and visite him. And after that they haue demanded of him such ordinarie thinges, as is vsed in such like visitations: then doo they learne of his estate, and of the prince that hath sent him, and in summe, the effect of his comming and ambassage: then doo they straightwayes at the houre dispatch a post vnto the gouernour or vizroy of the prouince, who is alwayes resident in the chiefe or metropolitan Citie thereof,

and hée at the same instant dooth dispatch another post with that message vnto the king and his roial counsel. And he dooth sende order vnto the ambassador, either to stay, or a safe conduct for him to go vnto the place whereas hee is. Likewise hée sendeth order vnto the iudge, howe hée shall intreate that ambassador, which is giuen according vnto the relation sent him, wherein hée did vnderstande the state of the king and prince that sent him. Likewise the number of souldiers yt shall beare him companie, and of all other thinges néedefull for him in his iourney: all the which is set downe in order, and in particular, as what they shall giue euery man to eate for him and his seruants, and in what townes, and howe hee shall be lodged. His safe conduct is brought him, written vppon a whited table (after the fashion as we haue tolde you heere before in manie places) and is with great l
                        •
                     tters, wherein is contained from what king that ambassador is sent. This table is borne alwayes before him, wheresoeuer hee dooth go. But that pasport, which is sent him afterwards from the royall councell, with facultie, that hée may go vnto the court, is after another sort: for that it is written in parchment and gallantlie lymned, and with the kings seale of Golde hanging at it, which is neuer giuen but at such like occasion▪ or for some prouision giuen to a vizroy.
                  Looke what is spent vppon this ambassadour in all his iourney, and vppon them that doo beare him companie for all necessaries, is vppon the kings cost and charges, and is paide by the kinges treasurers in euerie place where as they doo go. Generallie in all partes, they doo make him great feastes and banquets with pastimes and presents, that day that hee dooth enter into the Cittie of Ta
                           •
                        bin, or Paquin whereas the king is.
                  There goeth foorth to méete him without the citie, all the Gentlemen of the court, with the royall councel and president, who according vnto the saying of the Chinos, goeth forth with little lesse maiestie and companie then the king: who, if the ambassadour bee from a king that is mightie, they giue him the right hand, if not they giue him the left hand: and in this sort they go ether tal
                        •
                     ing with himselfe, or by interpreters demaunding of him of his health, and of his trauaile in

comming, and other thinges till hée come into the court of the pallace, whereas he is lodged▪ and there they doo leaue him, with some to beare him companie, and hee dooth returne vnto his house with all this company aforesaid. But when they do depart from him they doo giue him power in the name of the king, to make a certaine number of Loytias, and to set at libertie a certaine number of prisoners, such as are condemned to die, and other good déeds particular.
                  Those that doo enter in this kingdome with the title of an ambassador, they cannot do him any griefe, for anie delight or euill that he doth, although they can make good proofe thereof. And for that it is of a truth: you shall vnderstande the proofe by experience. There was sent vnto this king, one Bartholmew Perez a Portugall and his company, by order of the vizroy of the India with an ambassage from the king Don Manuel of Portugall, &amp; they were accused before the vizroy of the prouince of Canton, by the ambassadors of the king of Malaca that were there present, who were bounde vnto the court to treat of matters of their king: they did testifie that the ambassage that the Portugal did bring was false, and they were spies sent from the vizroy of the India for to view the fortresses of the citie, that they might come afterwards and take it, as they had done in many places of the India: they perseuering still in the euill and mischieuous intent, did will the vizroy to apprehend them, and to punish them as such spies did deserue, off
                        •
                     ing themselues to giue good information for the same.
                  Who after that he had well considered thereof, and consulted with the Loytias of the citie, and with his counsailors, they commanded that they should be apprehended, and put in straite prison, whereas their declarations were taken with great care deceit and pollicie: and by reason that in them they found contrarieties: some for feare confessed much more then that which was demanded: and other saide that it was of truth, so that by their confessions according vnto the lawes of the countrie, they were condemned to die, and sent their iudgement vnto the roiall councell for to confirme the same, with intent and great desire for to execute the same. The which being séene by the roiall councell, and considering with what title they entred into that kingdome, did not onely make voide the sentence and woulde

not confirme the same, but did send commandement vnto the vizroy to set them at libertie, and to returne fréely back againe vnto the India from whence they came, and that hee shoulde furnish them with all things necessarie in aboundance, til they were entred into the same, although in this time the ambassadors of the king of Malaca, who were in the court, did still perseuer in their malicious intent.
                  In which commandement, although it were true, all that which the foresaide ambassadors did testifie, and that they for feare of death did confesse it, yet it is sufficient that they entred into this kingdom the title of ambassador, whereby they should receiue any harme. But nowe let vs returne t
                        •
                      our purpose. So after this ambassador hath refreshed himselfe of his iourny, and receiued many banquets and orations of the Gentlemen of the court: vpon a day appointed he goeth to speake with the king, accompanied with all the Gentlemen of the court, and with the president of the councell, who doth giue him audi
                        •
                     nce in one of the thrée rich hals aforesaide, at all times as his businesse doth require. So when that all his busines is dispatched, and gratified with many gifts, he returneth backe againe from whence he came, and looke with what curtesie they did receiue him at his comming, the like they doo vnto him at his returne.
                  But if an ambassador doo come from any common wealth of the said kingdome, they doo not giue him the intertainement abouesaid, but cleane contrarie thereunto, for that he dooth enter into the citie, accompanied onely with the iustice, whose charge it is to lodge him in such houses as the king hath ordeined to the same effect: and to giue him all that is necessarie, taking of him the summe and effect wherefore he doth come: and he doth giue relation thereof vnto the president of the councell, and the president doth giue the king to vnderstand therof: then doo they appoint the day of audience, with this condition, that when he dooth go thither, hée must go on foote, or else on horseback without a bridle, with onely a halter on his horse head, in token of humility, and acknowledging to be a subiect. The day of his audience, he commeth forth obseruing the order and condition aforesaid, accompanyed with the iustice. And when hée doth come into a great place, which is right against the pallace of the king, he staieth there till an officer of the king doth come

vnto him (who is master of the ceremonies) and hee dooth cause him to procéede forwards, and doth shew him the place whereas hee must first kneele downe, with his handes ioyned togither in token of adoration or worship: and all the time of this ceremonie, his eies must bee fixed on that part where as they say the king is. In this sort hee goeth onwards his way, making in it other fiue adorations like vnto the first, vntill such time as he do come into the first hall of the pallace which is at the staires heade, whereas the president is set with great maiestie, and doth represent the kings person: who after that hee hath hearde the effect of his ambassage, dooth sende them away without answering one word at that time: but after that hee hath giuen the king to vnderstande, hée dooth sende him answere by that iustice, who hath the charge to lodge him, and to prouide him of all things necessarie for the time that hée is in the court.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXIIII. Of the ambassage that the king of Spaine did send vnto the king of this kingdome, and the occasions that did moue him thereunto, as also wherefore it was declared.
                  FOr to conclude this small historie, in the which I haue declared in summe, all such things as I haue vnderstoode of this kingdome of China vnto this, I meane such as I might wel set forth, leuing a great number more, (of the which I haue particular note: some for that they are vnknowne, and others for that they will cause admyration, because they haue not béene séene. And according vnto the counsell of the wise, they should not be intreated of, vntill that time that experience dooth make them more credible. And againe, I doo hold it for a lesse euill, to be reprehended, for breuitie (as some haue béene) then to bee prolix and tedious in the declaring, although it bee hurtfull vnto this worke, from the which I doo take away much that I might put in. Nowe letting all passe, I will in this last chapter declare, of the letter present, and ambassage, wherewith the king of Spaine did sende mee in the yeare of our Lorde one thousande one hundred and fourescore: for that in company of other religious men of my order,

I should passe from his mightie kingdome of Mexico to China, and to present it vnto the king of that countrie in his name: of all the which I will declare that which I doo vnderstande and know, not excéeding the limits of fidelitie, by reason that the ambassage was not ended, nor no conclusion in effect of that which was pretended, but doo hope in the deuine maiestie, and with the care and diligence that is put therein by the king of Spaine, shortlie to haue a conclusion of that they desire, for the which the letter and the rest was sent.
                  Béeing considered of by the Spaniards (such as were dwellers in the Ilands Philippinas, which by another name are called the Ilands of the Ponent or West) the thinges of great valour and riches, as of golde and silkes and many other thinges which is brought from the kingdome of China, and out of their ports, and how those which brought it, did sel it for a small quantitie in respect as they did estéeme it, and being certified by the saide Chinos of many other things which were in the firme land, wherof some of them haue béene made mention in this historie: being mooued with the conuerting of these soules, and with the profite that might come of traficke that they might haue with the Chinos: it was concluded by the gouernour and principals of the Citie of Manila, with the iudgement of the prouinciall of the order of saint Augustine, and of many other religious men that were both graue &amp; wise, such as were the first, that in those parts did preach the Gospel, and did baptise a great number of the dwellers therein, and did many other thinges, of the which I might say much, if it were to my purpose, and that my part were not therein: so that I say it was concluded amongst them to sende vnto the Catholike king graue personages, vnto whome intire credite might be giuen, for to giue relation what they vnderstoode of that kingdome, and also of the euident necessitie (that all those Ilands that were his) had for their conseruation to holde to friendes the Chinos their borderers, whereof might growe vnto them great benefites and profites: and likewise to request him (if it were his pleasure) to sende an ambassador to ye king of that kingdome the better to confirme their friendship &amp; to carrie with him some things which be vsed in his countrie,

which would be maruellous well estéemed of the Chinos, &amp; be a way vnto the preaching of the gospel, and bee a beginning that a farther contraction may growe betwixt the Christians and the Chinos, of the which shall follow the aforesaid profite vnto other countries, by the great quantitie of things, as well of riches as of other curiosities that shalbe brought from thēce. After they had well considered with great deliberation, who should be the person that they shoulde send vpon so long a iourney, for to request his maiestie of the aforesaid: in the ende they did agrée vppon, for to desire the prouinciall of the Augustine friers, who was called Frier Dilho de Herrera, a man of great learning and of great experience touching matters of those Ilands, for that hee was one of the first discouerers of them: they requested him for the loue of God, and the good seruice to his maiestie, and the benefite that might come thereby vnto these Ilands that he would take vpon him to go with this petition, for they were fully perswaded for that he had trauailed so manie places of those Ilands, as also for his office and vocation, there was none that better coulde put in effect their desire, and perswade with his maiestie the great importance of that ambassage: and manie other things necessarie touching the gouernement of those Ilands. This determination was liked well of them all, and that they had chosen well in sending of the prouinciall, who incontinent departed from the Ilands in a shippe that was pepared for Noua Hispania, which was in the yeare of Christ 1573. At his inbarking, hee was accompanied with the gouernour, and all those of that citie, of whom hee was maruellouslie well beloued for his holinesse and good condition. Desiring him with all diligence to procure to returne, with as much breuity as was possible, vnto those ilands, whereas they so much loued him, and had néede of his presence.
                  He did promise them to make all the spéede possible, and in paiment of the trauel that he did take vpon him, for the benifite &amp; profite, he requested them al that they would pray vnto God to giue a good voyage: they promised him to doo it, the which they did performe with particular care. Then did the master command to weigh ankers, and to set saile, which was in the moneth of Nouember the same yeare: and with reasonable

whether they arriued at the new Spaine, and came vnto the cittie of Mexico, and from thence they went and embarked themselues in the North seas, who with prosperous winds the xiii, day of August, the yeare following they ariued in San. Lucar debarameda in Spaine, and caried me in his company. From thence the day following we departed from Syuel, from whence wee departed forthwith toward Madrid, whereas his maiestie was at that present, and we came thither the fiftéenth day of September in anno 1574. the same wéeke that they had newes of the losse of the Goleta. Wée went straightwayes to kisse the kings hands, and caried the letters which we brought from his gouernor and citie: by whom both we and the letters were receiued with his accustomed benignitie, and did heare the petition with great satisfaction, for that the desire was holy and profitable, and told vs that he would command his counsell to vnderstand in the same with a particular consideration, and with so much breuitie as the thing required: and gaue vs thankes for the great trauell and long iourney, which we tooke vpon vs in his seruice, for to giue him notice of the discouering of this great kingdome, and of other things touching the Ilands Philippinas. He straightwayes commanded that we should be prouided for of all things necessarie for our sustentation, for the time that we should there remaine: and that we should go and giue account of all things, (for the which we came thither) vnto the counsel of the Indies: who was Don Iuan de Obando, vnto whom his maiestie did recommend the consideration to be done with great care, and to consult vpon the same. After that they had comuned with the roiall counsell of the Indies touching that which should be requisite and conuenient: which was done as it appeared in effect, for that they gaue vs facultie in a few dayes after, of all things that was requested from the said Ilands, except that which did touch the ambassage vnto the

                        ••
                     d a better occasion. So that with this resolution and with fortie religious men, and manie commissions from his maiestie touching the good gouernement of that new kingdome, wee departed from Syuell in the moneth of Ianuarie, the yeare following in 1575. whereas I remained by his order

and for certaine respects. But the aforesaid Prouinciall did imbarke himselfe with his fortie religious persons, and departed in the moneth of Iuly with a faire winde and merrie passage, till they came vnto newe Spaine, and from thence into the South sea, vntill they came in sight of the Ilands: whereas the wether did alter, and they were forced by the furie thereof to ariue at an Iland inhabited with Genti
                        •
                     es, by whome they were all slaine, and none escaped but onely an Indian natural of the Ilands, which wee carried from thence in our companie for Spaine. He afterwards came vnto Manilla and gaue them to vnderstand how they were all slaine, and how the Gentiles did teare all the papers and commissions in péeces, and of all that happened to them.
                  This being knowne by the gouernor, and by the rest that dwelt in the Ilands (after that they had done the rytes, with the funerall griefes, as iustice required in such a case) they finding themselues in the same necessitie, that before they were in by reason of the losse of the aforesaid Prouinciall and his companions, and also of the letters and prouisions sent from his maiestie: they forthwith in the same determination, did write new letters, in requesting that which in part the king had granted, (although they had no knowledge thereof) they did also therein write touching the ambassage that they did request for the king of China, adding therunto new occasions, wherby they should be moued to do them so much fauour as to send the ambassador afore requested: which was a thing of great importan
                        •
                     s for all those Ilands. When that these letters came in conformitie with the others before sent, the king did ordaine for gouernor of those Ilands, a Gentleman, who was called Don Gonsalo de Mercado, y Ronquillo, a man of great valor &amp; discretion, one that had serued the king as wel in the Peru. as in Mexico, with great fidelitie: who vnderstanding the earnest request wher
                        •
                     with those of the Ilands did aske the ambassage, &amp; howe much it did import to haue it (as a man then elected for gouernor of those Ilands, &amp; a matter that touched him very much,) did put the king and his counsell in memorie of the same: and in conclusion they answered that hee should foorthwith depart with the souldiers that were prouided for those parts, for that it was cōuenient so to be doone by reason of great necessitie that

they had of them in the said Ilands: and as for the ambassage, for that there was no such great necessitie nor haste, it should be intreated of at more leasure, when that the counsell wil aduertise themselues of al that shalbe conuenient touching that matter, &amp; that they would consult and confer with his maiestie, that he may as the right owner of them, command that which shuld be to the seruice of God and his benefite. So with this answere the said gouernor departed. It happened that in the moneth of August, in the yeare following, before that this gouernor was ariued at the Ilands, there came newe letters from thence, of supplications, requesting with greater instance, that which before at other times they had requested, sending with their petition the whole relation of the entrie of Frier Martin de Herrada, prouinciall of the Augustine Friers and his companions, into the kingdome of China, and of such things as they had seene and heard of (as may be séene at large in the said declaration, which is in the second part of this booke.) This being séene by his maiestie, he was resolued to send the ambassage which so many times they haue requested: this chanced at that time that he began to go vppon Portugall, a time of trouble, but yet a great token that it was the will of God, in whose hands (as the wise man saith) are the hearts of kings. For the appointment of one for to go on this ambassage, the king did remit it vnto his roial counsel of the Indies, whose president was Don Antonio de Padilla y meneses, who had communicated with me diuers times, touching matters of that kingdome &amp; of Mexico, whereas I was alwayes resident euer since I was seuentéene yeares of age, and by reason of matters that was committed vnto me, out of that country, was the occasion that I did vse to visit him the oftener: the which large conuersation and the good wil that hée did beare me, did perswade him that I could put in execution the ambassage of his maiestie, for that his will was that some religious person should do it: and they being fully perswaded that my good will and desire was for the saluation of those soules, and in all respects willing to serue his maiestie: all the which with the knowledge that I had of that large nauigation, and the qualitie of that countrie and people, was a great helpe to the accomplishing in effect the will of his maiestie and desire of those that dwelt in Philippina.
                  
                  
                     So after this charge being committed vnto me, and his maiestie read

By whose commandement I depart from the court vnto Syuell, where as order was giuen, that all such things should be prouided that I should carrie vnto the king. Whereas I was, procuring the same certaine dayes: and for that they were many the which I should carry▪ it was not possible by any meanes that they should be made readie against the departure of the fléete. Then the Licenciado Gasca de Salacar aforesaide, who was at that present resident in the cōtractation house of Syuel gaue his maiestie to vnderstand thereof, who was at Badaioz, occupied in matters touching the kingdome of Portugal, as aforesaid, and requested him to giue order what his pleasure was to be done therein: who commanded that the fleete should depart, and that I should stay till such time as all things were made and concluded that I shoulde carrie with me for the king of China, as in ample manner as hee had commanded. And when that all things were in good order, that they should cause

Then after that all thinges were in order by the commandement of the Licenciado Gasca, hée deliuered vnto me the kinges letter, and all other thinges. The which for that they were manie, and againe I haue beene tedious in this Chapter, I doo not declare it, for that the prudent lector, may of himselfe conceiue, if hee doo weigh the magnanimitie of the Catholike king that dooth sende them, and the mightinesse and richnesse of him to whome it is sent,

of the which we haue declared enough in this small historie, I would I could particularly declare it vnto you, as also the copie of the letter that his maiestie did send vnto that Heathen or Gentile king, a thing worthie of the author: but for that it came not to effect, neither had I anye licence of him that all o

But it is sufficient that the letter, and the present sent by his maiestie vnto the king of that countrey, was to no other intent, but to procure him and all his subiects to acknowledge the true God, and to exhort them to receiue our catholike faith, and to giue them to vnderstand the error wherein they are, and how ignorant they are of the knowledge of the true God, the creator of h

                  So being dispatched, I prosecuted my iourny, and order till I came vnto the kingdome of Mexico, whereas I found a certaine inconuenience, touching a matter néedful in that voiage, whereof his maiestie, in the commission he gaue me, willed me to be well 
                        •
                     duertised, and if it were néedfull to giue him notice thereof before I did passe any farther.
                  The vizroy of that kingdome, who was the Earle of Coruma, thought it good that I shoulde returne vnto Lysborne, whereas the king was at that instant, and to giue him to vnderstand of the difficultie that was found, in a meeting that the vizroy had caused to bee made of the most grauest personages of all that kingdome, about the prosecuting of that ambassage.
                  With this resolution I departed from that kingdome and returned for Spaine, and left the present in Mexico in the power of the kings officers, till such time as order was giuen what shoul

                  The second containeth the miraculous voiage that was made by frier Pedro de Alfaro of the order of S. Francis, and his companions vnto the said kingdome.
                  The third containeth a breefe declaration by the said frier, and of frier Martin Ignacio, that went out of Spaine vnto China, and returned into Spaine againe by the Orientall India, after that he had compassed the world. Wherein is contained many notable things that hee did see and had intelligence of in the voiage.

                  CHAP. I. The Spaniardes departe from Mexico vnto the Ilandes Philippinas, where they had intelligence of the mightie kingdome of China.
                  
                     GOuerning in the kingdom of Mexico, don Luys de Velasco, who was viceroye, and lieftenant in that place for the Catholike king don Phillip king of Spaine, was cō

                     ouldiers necessarie for the same, and to send them to discouer the Ilands of the west, those which that famous captaine Magallanes did giue notice of, when he did compasse the world in the ship called the Victorie.
                  
                  The viceroy with great care and diligence did performe the kinges commandement. This fléete and armie being prepared readie (which was not without great cost) hee caused them to depart out of the port at Christmas time in the yeare of 1564. and sent for general of the same fléete and for gouernour of that countrie which they should discouer, the worthie Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, who afte

                     warde died in the said Ilande with the title of Adelantado, a yeare after that the fathers Fryer Martin de Herrada and Fryer Geronimo Marin and their companies did enter into China.
                  
                  So after that our Spaniardes hadde discouered the sayde Ilandes, and some of them populared to the vse of his Maiestie, but in especiall that of Manilla which is fiue hun

They haue also founded in that citie a cathedrall Church, and erected a bishopricke.
                  And for Bishops of the same, his maiestie did ordaine the most reuerend fryer don Domingo de Salazar of the ord

                     r of preachers, in whom was comprehended some holinesse, good life and learning, as was requisite and necessarie for that prouince: and was consecrated in Madrid the yeare of 1579.
                  
                     At this present there be thrée monasteries of religious men in that Iland, the one of the order of S. Austen, and were the first that by the cōmandement of his maiestie did enter into this Ilands, preaching the law of the gospell, which was great profit vnto those soules, yet great trauaile vnto them, and cost many of them their liues in dooing it: the other monasterie is of barefoote Fryers of the order of S. Francis, of the prouince of S. Ioseph, who haue béene great examples, with great profit vnto them of those portes. The third are of the order of S. Dominicke or preachers, who haue done their dutie in all things so well as the other. These thrée orders were alonely in those Ilands for certaine yeares, till now of late time haue gone thither Iesuites, which haue bin a great aide and helpe vnto their religion.
                  When these Spaniardes were come vnto these Ilands, they had straightwaies notice of the mightie kingdome of China
                     ▪ as well by the relation of them of the Ilands (who tolde vnto them the maruels thereof) as also within a fewe daies after, they did sée and vnderstand, by ships that came into those ports with marchants that brought marchandise and other things of great curiositie from that kingdome, &amp; did particularly declare the mightinesse and riches therof: all which haue béen declared vnto you in the first thrée bookes of this historie. This beeing knowen vnto the religious people of S. Austin, who at that time were alone in those Ilands: but in especiall vnto the prouinciall, Fryer Martin de Herrada, a man of great valour, and wel learned in all sciences: who séeing y• great capacitie or towardnesse which the Chinos had more then those of the Ilandes in all things, but in especiall in their gallantnesse, discretion and wit: he straightwaies had a great desire to go thether with his fellow to preach the gospell vnto those people, of so good a capacitie to receiue the same: who with a pretended purpose to put it in vre &amp; effect, he began with great care &amp; studie to learne that language, the which he learned in few daies: &amp; did make therof a dictionarie. Thē afterwards they did giue great intertainmēt &amp; presents vnto the marchants that came frō 
                     China for to procure them to carie thē thether, &amp; many other things, the which did shew their holie-zeale: yea they did offer themselues to bee slaues vnto the marchants, thinking by y• means to enter in to

preach: but yet none of these diligences did take effect, till such time as the diuine maiestie did discouer a better way, as shalbe declared vnto you in this chapter following.

                     re so strong yt they were feared in all that prouince where as they were. This being knowen vnto the king and to his councell, they did straight way cōmand the viceroy of the prouince wher as the rouer was, that with all the haste possible he should gather together all the garrisons of his Frontyers, to apprehende and take him, and if it were possible to carrye him

aliue vnto the Citie of Taybin, if not his head. The Uiceroy incontinent did gather together people necessarie and in great haste to followe him.
                  The which being knowen vnto Limahon the rouer, who saw, that with the people he had, he was not able to make resistance against so great a number as they were, and the eminent danger that was therein, he called together his companies, and went from thence vnto a port of the sea, that was a fewe leagues from that place: and did it so quickly and in such secret, that before the people that dwelt therein, could make any defence (for that they were not accustomed to any such assaultes, but liued in great quietnesse) they were lordes of the port and of all such ships as were there: into the which they imbarked themselues straightwaies, wayed anker and departed to the sea, whereas they thought to bee in more securitie than on the lande (as it was true.) Then hee séeing himselfe lorde of all those seas, beganne to robbe and spoyle all shippes that he could take as well strangers as of the naturall people: by which meanes in a small time hee was prouided of mariners and other thinges which before hee lacked, requisite for that new occupation. He sacked, robbed and spoyled all the townes that were vpon the coast, and did verie much harme. So he finding himselfe verie strong with fortie shippes well armed, of those he had out of the port, and other that he had taken at the sea, with much people such as were without shame, their handes imbrued with robberies and killing of men, hee imagined with himselfe to attempt greater matters, and di
                        •
                      put it in execution: he assaulted great townes, and did a thousand cruelties: in such sort, that on all that coast whereas hee was knowen, he was much feared, yea and in other places farther off, his fame was so published abroad. So he following this trade and exercise, he chanced to meete with an other roouer as himselfe, called, Vintoquian, likewise naturally borne in China, who was in a port voide of any care or mistrust, whereas Limahon finding opportunitie, with greater courage did fight with the shippes of the other: that although they were thréescore ships great and small,One rouer robbed an other. and good souldiers therein, hée did ouercome them, and tooke fiue and fiftie of their ships, so that Vintoquian escaped with fiue ships. Then Limahon séeing

himselfe with a fléete of nintie fiue shippes well armed and with many stout people in them, knowing that if they were taken, they should be all executed to death: they therefore setting all feare a part, gaue themselues to attempt new inuentions of euill▪ not onely in robbing of great Cities, but also in destroying of them.

                  THe complayntes increased euerie day more and more vnto the king and his counsell, of the euils doone vnto the Chinos by this rouer Lymahon. For the which commandement was giuen straightwaies vnto the Uiceroy of that prouince (whereas he vsed to execute his euill) that with great expedition he might be taken (for to cut off this inconuenience,One hundred and thirtie great ships of warre with fortie thousand men.) who in few dayes did set foorth to sea, one hundred and thirtie great shippes well appointed, with fortie thousand men in them, and one made generall ouer them all, a gentle man called Omoncon, for to go seeke and fo

                  Of all this prouision, Lymahon had aduertisement by some secrete friends, who séeing that his enemies were many, and he not able to counteruaile them, neither in shippes nor men, determined not to abide the comming, but to retire and depart from that coast: so in flying he came vnto an Ilande in secrete called Tonznacaotican, which was fortie leagues from the firme land, and is in the right way of nauigation to the Ilands Philippinas.
                  
                  In this Iland was Lymahon retyred with his armie a certaine time, and durst not returne to the firme land, for that he knew that the kinges fléete did lie vpon the coast to defende the fame. And although he did send foorth some ships a robbing, yet did they not doo any thing of importance, but rather cam

                      flying away from the mightie power of the kinges. From this Ilande they did goefoorth with some of their ships robbing and

spoyling al such as they met with marchandice &amp; other things that they carried from one Ilande to an other, and from the Iland vnto the firme, &amp; comming from thence amongst them all they caused to take two ships of China which came frō 
                     Manilla, and were bound to their owne countrie. And hauing then in their power they searched them vnder hatches, and found that they had rich things of golde, and spanish ryalles, which they had in truck of their marchandice the which they carried to the Ilandes. They informed themselues in all points of the state and fertilitie of that countrie, but in particular of the Spaniardes, and how many there were of thē in the citie of Manilla, who were not at that present aboue seuentie persons, for that the rest were separated in the discouering and populing of other Ilands newly found, and vnderstanding that these few did liue without any suspition of enimies and had neuer a fort nor bulwarke, and the ordinance which they had (although it was very good) yet was it not in order to defend themselues nor offend their enemies, hee determined to goe thither with all his fléete and people, for to destroy and kill them, and to make himselfe lorde of the saide Ilande of Manilla and other adiacent there nigh the same. And there he thought himselfe to be in securitie from the power of the king, which went séeking of him. And so as he was determined, he put it in vre with as much expedition as was possible.
               
               
                  CHAP. IIII. This rouer Limahon goeth to the Ilands Philippinas, and commeth to the citie of Manilla.
                  THis Rouer Limahon determining to goe and to take the Ilands Philippinas, and to make himselfe lord and king ouer them all, but first to kill the Spaniardes, which hee thought easely to be done, for that there was so fewe. And there he pretended to liue in securitie without feare that before he had of the kings great fléete, for that it was so farre distant from the firme lande. So with this determination hee departed from those Ilandes whereas hee was retyred, and went to sea, and sayling towardes the Ilandes Philippinas they passed in sight of the Ilandes of the Illocos, which had

a towne called Fernandina, which was newe founded by the Captaine Iohn de Salzedo, who at that instant was in the same for lieutenant to the gouernour. Foure leagues from the same they met with a small galley, which the said Iohn de Salzedo had sent for victuals. There was in her but 25. souldiers besides ye rouers, so that with the one &amp; the other they were but a fewe in number, for that as they thought they did trauaile in places of great securitie, and without any suspition to m
                        •
                     ete enemies. So soone as Limahon had discouered the galley, hee cast about towardes her, and with great ease did take her, and did burne and kill all that was in her, and pardoned one of them.
                  This being done, he did prosecute his voyage according vnto his determination, and passed alongest, but not in such secret but that hee was discouered by the dwellers of the towne of Fernandina, who gaue notice thereof vnto the lieutenant of the gouernor aforesaide, as a woonder to sée so many shippes together, and a thing neuer séene before at those Ilands. Likewise it caused admiration vnto him, and made him to thinke and to imagine with great care what it might bee, hee sawe that they did beare with the citie of Manilla, and thought with himselfe, that so great a fléete as that was could not goe to the place which they bare in with, for any goodnesse towardes the dwellers therein, who were voide of all care, and a small number of people as aforesaid. Wherewith hee determined with himselfe with so great spéede as it was possible, to ioyne togither such Spaniards as were there, which were to ye number of fiftie foure▪ and to depart and procure (although they did put themselues in danger of inconuenience) to get the forehande of them, to aduertise them of Manilla, and to ayde and helpe them to put their artilerie in order, and all other thinges necessarie for their defence.
                  This determination the Captayne did put in vre verie spéedily, which was the occasion that the citie and all those that were in it, was not destroyed and slayne: yet they could not eschue all the harme, for that the ships that carried them were small, and a few rouers &amp; not verie expert, for that the suddennesse of their departure would not afforde better choice, as also they went from one place to an other procuring of victuals: all

which was the occasion that they did not come thither in such time as they desired, and as was conuenient.
                  This Lymahon was well prouided of prouision and al other thinges necessarie, and hauing the wind fayre, he was alwaies in the fore front, and came in the sight of Manilla vppon saint Andros eue, in the yeare 1574. whereas he came to an anker that night with all his whole fléete. And he séeing that the end of his pretence consisted in expedition before that they should be séene of those of the citie, or discouered by them on the coasts. The nightes at that time being very darke, which was a great helpe vnto them: he choose foure hundred of his best souldiers▪ such as hee was fully perswaded of their valour and stout courage, and put them in small vessels, and charged those that went with them for Captaines, to make such expedition that they might come vnto the Citie before it was day, and the first thing that they did was to set fire on the Citie, and not to let escape one man liuing therin, promising them that at the break of the day he would bewith them to giue them aide and succour if néede did require, which they did. But for that nothing is done without the will and permission of God, it went not with Limahon and his foure hundred souldiers according as he did make reckoning: for that all that night the winde was of the shoore, and the more the night came on, the more the wind encreased, which was such a contradiction vnto their expectation, that they could not by night disembarke themselues, although they did procure by all meanes possible by policie and force for to do it, Which of certaintie and without all doubt, if this had not b

                     ene (at great ease) they had brought to a conclusion their euill pretence, with the spoyle and losse of the citie and all that dwelt therein: for their pretence was for to destroy and beat it downe, as it might well appeare by the commaundement hee gaue vnto his Captaines.

                  FOr all the contradiction of the winde this same night the foure hundred Chinos did put themselues within a league

                     he citie, vpon S. Andrewes day at eight of the clocke in the morning, whereas they left their boates and went a land, and in great haste beganne to march forwardes in battaile a raye deuided in two partes, with two hundred hargabuses afore and immediatly after them other two hundred pickemen: and by reason that they were manie and the Countrie verie plaine, they were straightwayes discouered by some of the Citie, who entered in with a great noyse, crying, arme, arme, arme, the enemies come. The which aduice did little profite, for that there was none that would beléeue them: but beléeued that it was some false larum doone by the people of the countrie for to mocke them. But in conclusion the enemies were come vnto the house of the Generall of the fielde, who was called Martin de Goyti, which was the first house in all the Citie that wayes which the enemies came. And before that the Spaniardes and souldiers that were within the Towne could bee fully perswaded the rumour to be true, the enemies had set fire vpon his house, and slewe him and all that were within, that none escaped but onely the goodwife of the house, whom they left naked and verie sore wounded, beléeuing that she had béene dead: but afterwardes shee recouered and was healed of her woundes. In the meane time that they were occupied in their first crueltie, they of the Citie were fully resolued of the trueth, although all of them, with this successe vnlooked for, were as people amased and from themselues: yet in the end they sounded to armour, and did prouide to saue their liues. Some souldiers went foorth vppon the sandes, but in ill order as the time did permitte, and slewe all the Chinos that they did méete, and none escaped: which was the occasion that the rest did ioyne themselues together, and put th

                  This is the proper resistance of the Spani

                     The Chinos in retyring lost some of their souldiers, but vnto the Spaniardes no great harme, and in this their defence, did notable a

of Manilla, with as much spéede as was possible he did call together all their Captaynes and dwellers therein: and with a generall consent they did determine to make some defence for to resist them as well as they could (for the time that the enemie did remaine in the port aforesaide): for to the con
                        •
                     rarie the Spaniardes should loose great credite, if that they should forsake and leaue the towne, so long as their liues did indure. For in no other place in all the Ilandes th

                        •
                     d haue any securitie. With this determination they put this worke in execution, and spared no person of what qualitie and degree so euer he was, but that his hande was to helpe all that was possible, the which indured two dayes &amp; two nightes, for so long the Rouer kept his shippes and came not abrode: for these woorthie souldiers vnderstoode, that remayning with their liues their labour and trauaile would soone be eased.
                  In which time of their continuall labour, they made a fort with pipes and bordes filled with sande and other necessaries thereto belonging, such as the time would permit them: they put in carriages, foure excellent peeces of artilerie that were in the citie. All the which being put in order, they gathered together all the people of the citie into that little fort, which they made by the prouidence of God our Lorde, as you may beléeue, for that it was not his pleasure that so many soules as were in those Ilands baptised and sealed with the light and knowledge of his holy faith, should returne againe to be ouercome with the deuill: out of whose power hee brought them by his infinite goodnes &amp; mercie: neither would hee that the friendship should be lost that these Ilandes had with the mightie kingdome of China. By which meanes we may coniecture that the diuine power had ordained the remedie of saluation for all that countrie. The night before the enemie did giue assault vnto the Citie, came thether the Captayne Iohn de Salzedo lieutenant vnto the Gouernour of the Townes of Fernandina, who as aforesayde, came with purpose to ayde and helpe the Spaniardes that were then in Manilla. Whose comming, without all doubt with his companions, was the principall remedie, as well vnto the Citie, as vnto all those that were within it: for considering that they were but fewe, and the great paines they tooke in making the last resistance,

and the labor and trauaile they had in the ordayning of the fort for their defence with other necessaries against that which was to come, ioyning therewith the feare that was amongst them of the assalt past: surely they had néede of such a succour as this was: and surely by the opinion of all men, it was a myracle of God, doone to bring them thether. So with the comming of this Captaine with his people, they all recouered newe courage, with great hope valiantly to resist their enimies: for the which incontinent they did put all thinges in good order, for that the Rouer the morning following, before the breake of the day▪ (which was the second day after hee gaue the first assalt) was with all his fléete right against the port, and did put a lande sixe hundreth souldiers, who at that instant did s
                        •
                     t vpon the Citie, the which at their pleasure they did sacke and burne (for that it was left alone without people, as aforesaide by the order and commaundement of the gouernour, which for their more securitie were retyred into the fort.)
                  So hauing fired the Citie, they did assalt the fort with great crueltie, as men fleshed with the last slaughter, thinking that their resistance was but small. But it fell not out as they did beléeue, for that all those that were within were of so valiant courage, that who so euer of their enemies that were so bolde as to enter into their fort, did paye for their boldnesse with the losse of their liues. Which being séene by the Chinos they did retire, hauing continued in the fight almost all the day, with the losse of two hundreth men, that were slaine in the assalt, and many other hurt, and of the Spaniardes were slaine but onely two, the one was the Ancient bearer, called Samho Hortiz, and the other was the Bayliefe of the Citie called Francisco de Leon. All which being considered by Lymahon the Rouer, who being politike and wise, and sawe that it was losse of time and men, to goe forwardes with his pretence against the valiauntnesse of the Spaniardes, (which was cleane contrarie vnto that which had proued vnto that day) he thought it the best way to embarke himselfe and to set sayle, and goe vnto the porte of Cabite from whence he came. But first hee gathered togither all his dead people, and after did burie them at the Ilande aforesaid, where as he stayed two dayes for the same purpose.
                  
                     That being doone, he straightwayes departed from thence and returned the same way that he came, till they ariued in a mightie riuer, fortie leagues from the Citie of Manilla, that is called Pangasinan, the which place or soyle did like him verie well, and where he thought he might be sure from them, who by the commaundement of the king went for to seeke him.
                  There hee determined to remayne, and to make him selfe lorde ouer all that countrie, the which hee did with little trauaile, and built himselfe a fort one league within the ryuer, where as he remayned certayne dayes, receauing tribute of the inhabitants there abouts, as though he were their true and naturall lorde: and at times went foorth with his ships robbing and spoyling all that he met vpon the coast. And spred abroade that hee had taken to him selfe the Ilandes Philippinas, and howe that all the Spaniardes that were in them, were eyther slaine or fledde away: wherewith hee put all the Cities and Townes bordering there aboutes in great feare, and also how that he had setled himself vpon this mightie riuer Pangasinan, whereas they did receiue him for their lord, and so they did obey him, and paide him tribute.

                  THe Gouernour vnderstanding by the Ilanders, and of those that dwelt in the Citie of Manilla, of the fame that the Rouer Limahon did publish abroad in all places where as he went, howe that he had ouerthrowen and slaine the Spaniardes: and being of them well considered, that if in time they did not preuent the same, it might be the occasion of some great euill, that afterwardes they should not so easely remedie as presently they might: and those which were their friendes and subiectes in all those Ilandes, giuing credite vnto that which the Rouer declared, might be an occasion that they should rebell against them, by reason that the naturall

people were many and they but a few: for that vnto that time they had sustained themselues onely by the fame to be inuincible. With this consideration they entred into counsell, and did determine to ioyne together all the people they could, and being in good order, to follow and séeke the Rouer, for that they vnderstood of necessitie he must abide and repayre himself in some place nigh there aboutes, for that he durst not goe vnto China for feare that he had of the kings fleete, and fearing that they should vse such policies as hee hath vsed, they might come on him vnwares, and destroy him as he had done others. And séeming vnto them (that although they could not destroy him altogether) yet at the least theyshould be reuenged of the harme that they had receiued, &amp; thereby to giue to vnderstand that the fame yt he hath giuen out of himselfe was a lie, and should be an occasion for to remaine in their old securitie, &amp; also had in better estimation and opinion of the dwellers there abouts, as also to cause great friendship with the king of China, for that it is against a traytor and one that hath offended him.
                  This determination they put in vre and effect according as the time would permit: in which time they had certaine newes howe that the Rouer was in the riuer of Pagansinan, and there did pretende to remaine. These newes were very ioyfull vnto the Spaniardes. Then the Gouernours commanded to be called together all people bordering there abouts, and to come vnto the Citie where as hee was. Likewise at that time he did giue aduice vnto such as were Lordes and Gouernours of the Ilandes called Pintados, commanding them to come thither, with such shippes and people as they could spare as well Spaniardes as the naturall people of the countrie. All this was accomplished and done with great spéede, the people of the countrie came thither with great good will▪ but in especiall those of the Ilandes of the Pintados. After the death of Martin de Goyti, who was slaine in the first assault of the Chinos as aforesayde in the Citie of Manilla, the Gouernor did ordaine in his roome for generall of the fiel
                        •
                     , in the name of his maiestie, Iohn de Salzedo, who with all this people, and with those that were in the citie went foorth (leauing the gouernor no more ayde thē that which was sufficient for the defence of the citie &amp; the fort that they had new made, which was verie

All which went with great good will &amp; courage, to be reuenged on the iniurie receiued, or to die in the quarrell. All which people were embarked in small ships and two foygattes that came from the Ilandes there borderers, for that the shortnes of time would not permit them to prouide bigger shipping, neyther should they haue found thē as they would, for that at such time as the inhabitants therabouts did sée the rouer in ass
                        •
                     lt against the citie, they did set fire on a small galley and other bigge ships that were in the same port, and did rise against the Spaniards, beléeuing that it had not béene possible for them to escape so great and mightie a power: although since the first entrie of the Spaniardes in those Ilandes they were verie subiect. The Generall of the fielde with the people aforesaide, did depart from Manilla the thrée &amp; twentith day of March Anno 1575, and ariued at the mouth of the riuer Pagansinan vpon tenable wednesday in the morning next following without being discouered of any, for that it was doone with great aduice, as a thing that did import verie much. Then straightwaies at that instant the generall did put a lande all his people and foure péeees of artilerie, leauing the mouth of the riuer shutte vp with his shipping in chayning the one to the other, in such sort that none could enter in neyther yet goe foorth to giue anie aduice vnto the Rouer of his ariuall: hee commaunded some to goe and discouer the fléete of the enimie, and the place whereas hee was fortified, and charged them verie much to doo it in such secrete sort, that they were not espied: for therein consisted all their whole worke. The Captaines did as they were commanded, and found the Rouer voyde of all care or suspition to receiue there any harme, as hee found them in the Citie of Manilla when he did assault them.
                  This securitie that hee thought himselfe in did proceede from the newes that hee had from his friendes at the China, that although they did prouide to sende against him, yet could they not so quickly haue any knowledge where hee was, neyther finde out the place of his abiding: and againe hee knewe that the Spaniards of the Philippinas remained without shippes, for that they had burnt them as you haue heard,

and that they had more néede to repayre themselues of their ill intreatie the yeare past, then to séeke any reuengement of their iniuries receiued.
                  The Generall of the fielde being fully satisfied of his negligence and voide of care, and giuen to vnderstande of the secretest way that was to goe vnto the fort whereas the Rouer was: he commaunded the Captayne Gabriell de Ribera, that straightwayes he should depart by lande, and that vppon a suddaine, he should strike alarum vpon the enemie, with the greatest tumult that was possible. Likewise hee commanded the Captaynes Pedro de Caues and Lorenso Chacon, that either of them with fortie souldiers should goe vp the riuer in small shippes and light, and to measure the time in such sort, that as well those that went by lande, as those that went by water, should at one instant come vppon the fort, and to giue alarum both together, the better to goe thorough with their pretence: and he himselfe did remaine with all the rest of the people, to watch occasion and time for to ayde and succour them if néede required. This their purpose came so well to passe, that both the one and the other came to good effect: for those that went by water, did set fire on all the fléet
                        •
                      of the enemie: and those that went by lande at that instant had taken and set si
                        •
                     s on a trench made of tymber, that Lymahon had caused to bee made for the defence of his people and the fort: and with that furie they slewe more then one hundreth Chinos, and tooke prisoners seuentie women which they founde in the same trench, but when that Lymahon vnderstoode the rumour, he tooke himselfe straightwayes to his fort which he had made for to defend himselfe from the kinges nauie, if they should happen to finde him out: and there to saue his life vpon that extremitie, he commaunded some of his souldiers to goe foorth and to skirmish with the Spaniardes who were verie wearie with the trauaile of all that day, and with the anguish of the great heate, with the burning of the ships, and the trench which was intollerable, for that they all burned together.
                  The Captaines séeing this, and that their people were out of order, neither could they bring them into any, for that they were also weary (although ye general of the field did succour thē
                     
in time, the which did profite them much) yet did they sound a retraite &amp; did withdraw themselues with the losse of fiue Spaniards and thirtie of the Indians their friends, and neuer a one more hurt. Then the next day following the Generall of the fielde did bring his souldiers into a square battle, and began to march towards the fort, with courage to assalt it if occasion did serue thereunto: hee did pitch his campe within two hundreth paces of the fort, and founde that the enimie did all that night fortifie himselfe verie well, and in such sort that it was perilous to assalt him, for that he had placed vpon his fort thrée péeces of artilerie, and many bases, besides others ingins of fire worke. Seing this, &amp; that his péeces of artilerie that hee brought were very small for to batter, and little store of munition for that they had spent all at the assalt which the rouer did giue them at Manilla, the Generall of the fielde, and the captaines concluded amongst themselues, that séeing the enimie had no ships to escape by water, neither had hee any great store of victuals for that all was burnt in the ships, it was the best and most surest way to besiege the fort, and to remaine there in quiet vntill that hunger did constraine them either to yéeld or come to some conclusion▪ which rather they will then to perish with hunger.
                  This determination was liked well of them all, although it fell out cleane contrarie vnto their expectation, for that in the space of thrée monethes that siege indured, this Limahon did so much that within the fort he made certaine small barks, and trimmed them in the best manner he coulde, wherewith in one night hee and all his people escaped, as shall bee tolde you: a thing that séemed impossible, and caused great admiration amongst the Spaniards, and more for that his departure was such that he was not discouered, neither by them on the water nor on the lande. What happened in these thrée monethes, I doo not here declare, although some attempts were notable, for that my intent is to declare what was the occasion that those religious men and their consorts did enter into the kingdome of China, and to declare of that which they said they had séene: for the which I haue made relation of the comming of Limahon, and of all the rest which you haue heard.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. VIII. Omoncon captain of the king of China commeth to seeke Limahon, and doth meete with Spaniards.
                  IN the meane time that the siege indured at the fort, as you haue vnderstood, there went and came certaine vessels which brought victuals and other necessaries from the cittie of Manilla, which was but fortie leagues from the mouth of that riuer of Pagasinan, as hath béene tolde you. It happened vppon a day that a shippe of Myguel de Loarcha, wherein was Frier Martin de Herrada Prouinciall of the Augustine Friers, who was come vnto the riuer Pagansinan for to sée the Generall of the fielde, and in the same shippe returned vnto Manilla to hold Capitulo, or court in the saide Ilande and port of Buliano. Seuen leagues after they were out of the mouth of Pagasinan, they mette with a shippe of Sangleyes, who made for the port, and thinking them to bée enimies, they bore with them (hauing another shippe that followed them for their defence) and had no more in them but the saide prouinciall and fiue Spanyards besides the mariners. This shippe of Sangley séeing that hee did beare with them, woulde haue fledde, but the winde woulde not permit him, for that it was to him contrarie, which was the occasion that the two shippes wherein the Spanyards were, for that they did both saile and rowe, in a small time came within Cannon shot. In one of the shippes there was a Chino called Sinsay, one that had béene many times at Manilla with merchandise, and was a verie friend and knowne of the Spanyards, and vnderstoode their language, who knowing that shippe to be of China, and not to be a rouer, did request our people not to shoote, neither to doo them any harme vntill such time as they were informed what they were in that same shippe.
                  This Sinsay went straight wayes into the fore shippes, and demaunded what they were, and from whence they came: and bing well informed, he vnderstoode that he was one of the ships of warre that was sent out by the king of China, to séeke the rouer Limahon, who leauing the rest of the fléet behinde, came forth to séeke in those Ilands to see if he coulde discouer him to

be any of them: and the better to bee informed thereof, they were bounde into the port of Buliano, from whence they came with their two shippes: from whome they woulde haue fledde, thinking they had béene some of the rouers shippes. Being fully perswaded the one of the other, they ioyned togither with great peace and friendshippe: the Spanyards straightwayes entred into their boate and went vnto the shippe of the Chinos, and carried with them the aforesaid Sinsay for to be their interpreter, and 
                        •
                     o speake vnto the Chinos. In the saide shippe came a man of great authoritie who was called Omoncon,
                     The captaine generall of the king of China.
                      who brought a commission from their king, and shewed it vnto the Spanyards and vnto the father Prouinciall: in the which the king and his councell did pardon all those souldiers that were with Limahon, if that forthwith they would leaue him and returne vnto the kings part: and likewise did promise great gifts and fauour vnto him that did either take or kill the aforesaid rouer. Then did Sinsay declare vnto him of the comming of the rouer vnto the Ilands, and all that happened in the siege of the Cittie, as aforesaide: and howe they had him besieged in the riuer of Pagansinan, from whence it was not possible for him to escape.
                  The captain Omoncon reioyced very much of these newes, and made many signes of great content, and did embrace the Spanyards many times, and gaue other tokens wherby he di
                        •
                      manifest the great pleasure he receiued, and woulde therewith straight-waies depart vnto the rest of the fléet. And for that they looked euerie day for the death or imprisonment of the rouer, the better to informe himselfe: hee determined (for that it was so nigh hand) to go and sée the Generall of the fielde in Pagansinan, and carry with him Sinsay one that was knowne both of the one and the other: by whose meanes they might treate of such things that best accomplished the confirmation of the peace and friendship betwixt the Chinos &amp; the Spaniards, as also of the death or imprisonment of Limahon. With this resolution▪ the one departed vnto Pagansinan whereas they ariued the same day, and the others vnto Manilla whether they went for victuals.
               
               
                  CHAP. IX. Omoncon is well receiued of the Generall of the field, and

lodged in Manilla with the gouernor, whereas they doo conclude the going of the fathers of Saint Augustine to China.
                  WHen that the Generall of the field vnderstood wherfore the comming of Omoncon was, hee did entertaine him with great curtesie: and after that hee had giuen him to vnderstand in what extremitie he had brought the rouer (which was a thing impossible for him to escape, except it were with wings) hee did counsell him, that for the time till hee brought his purpose to effect (which could not be long) that he would go vnto Manilla, which was not farre from thence, and there to recreate and sport himselfe with the gouernor and other Spaniards that were there, for that hee alone was sufficient to accomplish his pretēce, without the comming thither of the kings fléete, neither for to remoue out of the port whereas they were in securitie. And for his going thither he should haue a shippe of his the which did row, and was for to bring victuals and other prouision, and he shoulde go in the company of the Captaine Pedro de Chaues that was bound vnto Manilla, and promised him that within few dayes he would giue him the Rouer aliue or deade, which vnto the iudgement of all men coulde not bée long.
                  
                     Omoncon considering that this offer might come well to passe, did put it straightwayes in vre, &amp; did imbarke himselfe in the company of ye captain, &amp; sent his ship wherin he came alone by sea, because it was big &amp; drew much water: the which was constrained to turne backe againe into the part from whence he went, by reason of stormie windes and wether, and was no impediment in the other with Ores, for that hee went alongst the shoore and was shrowded with the land from the force of the wind, so that in few dayes they arriued in the port of the cittie of Manilla, whereas they were well receiued and feasted of the gouernor. Omoncon remained ther certaine dayes, after the which he séeing that the siege did long endure, and that his staying might cause suspition of his death: and againe, that the whole fléete did tarrie his comming to his intelligence of the rouer, being fully perswaded and certaine that hee coulde not escape the Spaniards hand: they had him in such a straight, &amp;

that they would without all doubt sende him vnto the king aliue or dead (as they promised him) hee was determined to returne vnto China with the good newes that he had vnderstood, with a determinate intent, to r
                        •
                     turne againe and carrie the rouer after that they had him prisoner. With this resolution in the end of certaine dayes he went vnto the gouernor▪ certifying him of his pretence, whereby he might giue him license to put it in execution. The gouernor did like wel of his pretence, and did promise him the same the which the generall of the fielde did offer vnto him: and which was, so soone as the rouer should be taken prisoner or slaine, to sende him vnto the king without any delay, or else to put him whereas he should be foorth comming, and to giue them aduertisement to send for him, or come himselfe: and did offer him more, that for his voyage he should be prouided forthwith of all things necessarie, without lacking of any thing. Omoncon did giue him great thankes for the same, and in recompence therof did promise vnto the gouernor, for that he vnderstoode and had intelligence of the fathers of S. Augustine, that his honor, and his antecessor, and the Adelan

                     ous men, to intreat of the preaching of the Gospel, and to see the wonders of that kingdome, and howe that they neuer coulde put this their desire in execution, for that those Chinos which came thither although they did offer them whatsoeuer they would demand, fearing the punishment that should be executed on them according vnto the lawes of the kingdome:
                        Omoncon promiseth to carrie the friers vnto China.
                      he did promise him that he would carrie them with him vnto China, such religious men as his honour would command, and some souldiers such as would go with them: hoping with the good newes that hée carried, to runne in no daunger of the Law, neither the vizroy of Aucheo to thinke euill thereof, and for a more securitie that they should not be euill intreated, hee woulde leaue with him pledges to their content.
                  The gouernor reioyced verie much at this his offer, for that it was the thing that he and all those of the Ilands most desired of long time since, and did straightwayes accept his offer: saying that he did clearely dis
                        •
                     harge him of his pledges, for that he was fully satisfied of his valor and worthines, and that hee

would not doo the thing that should not be decent vnto his person and office. The gouernor being verie ioyful of these newes, did therewith sende for the prouinciall of the Augustine friers, who was elected but fewe dayes past: his name was Frier Alonso de Aluarado, a man of a sincere life, and one of them that was sent by the Emperor in the discouerie of the newe Guinea, vnto whome hee declared the offer that the Captaine Omoncon had made vnto him: whereat he reioyced so much that being an old man, hee would himselfe haue gone thither: to which the gouernor would not consent in respect of his age, and other particularities: but entred in counsel who were best to go, and to finde one that were fitte to execute that which they had pretended (which was as wée haue saide,A good pretence. to bring in and plant in that kingdome the holie Catholike faith:) they determined that there shoulde go but two religious men, by reason that at that time there was but a 
                        •
                     ewe of them, and two souldiers in their companie.The Friers names that wēt to China.
                      The religious men shoulde bee Frier Martin de Herrada of Pamplona, who left off the dignitie of Prouinciall, and was a man of great learning and of a holy life: and for the same effect had learned the China tongue, and manie times for to put his desire in execution did offer himselfe to bee slaue vnto the merchants of China, onely for to carrie him thither: and in companie with him should go Frier Hieronimo Martin, who also was verie well learned, and of the Cittie of Mexico: the souldiers that were appointed to beare them companie, were called Pedro Sarmiento chiefe sargeant of the Cittie of Manilla of Vilorado, and Miguel de Loarcha, both principall men, and good Christians, as was conuenient for that which they tooke in hand. These fathers did carrie them for this purpose, that if they did remaine there with the king preaching of the Gospell, then they shoulde returne with the newes thereof to giue the Gouernour to vnderstande of all that they had séene, and happened vnto them: and likewise vnto the king of Spaine, if néede did so require.
                  This offer of the captaine Omoncon, and the appointment which was made by the gouernour and the prouinciall, was knowne throughout al the Citie, and after that they had made great reioycings and feasts for the same, it was approued of all

men, that those that were named, were principall persons, as aforesaid, and were fully certified, that there should nothing be neglected of that they did commaunde them: neither let passe any occasion, for that it was that which they did all desire, but in particular, for the

                     eruice and honor of God, and for the benefite and profite that shoulde redowne vnto them all by the mutuall contractation betwixt the one nation &amp; the other: and also giue the king to vnderstande of so good newes as this is. The Gouern

                      did straightwayes call those persons that were named and appointed to come before the captaine Omoncon, and tolde them what was determined: the which they did accept with great ioy, and gaue great thankes, and the gouernor in token of gratitude, did giue vnto the Captaine Omoncon in the presence of them all, a gallant chaine of golde,A token that fine cloath is esteemed. and a rich robe of crimson in graine: a thing that hee estéemed verie much, and much more estéemed in China, for that it is a thing that they haue not there. Besides this, they did ordaine a reasonable present for to sende vnto the gouernor of Chincheo, he that dispatched Omoncon by the commandement of the king to go and séeke the rouer: also another present for the vizroy of the prouince of Ochian, who was at that present in the citie of Aucheo.
                  
                  And for that Sinsay shoulde not finde himselfe agréeued (who was a merchant well knowne amongst them, and perhappes might bee the occasion of some

                     uill and disturbance of their pretence) they gaue vnto him also another chaine of golde, as well for this, as also for that hee was euer a sure and perfite friend vnto the Spaniards. Then straightwayes by the commaundement of the Gouernor there were brought togither all such Chinos as were captiue and taken from Limahon out of the fort aforesaide, at Pagansinan, and gaue them vnto Omoncon to carrie them free with him: and gaue likewise commaundement that the Generall of the fielde, and all such Captaines and souldiers that were at the siege of the forte, shoulde giue vnto him all such as did there r

                  CHAP. X. Omoncon departeth with certificate, in what perplexitie he left Limahon the rouer, and doth carrie with him the Fathers of S. Augustine.
                  THe twelfth day of Iune, in the yeare of our Lord, 1575. being sunday in the morning: the aforesaid Gouernor and all that were in the cittie did ioyne and go together vnto the monasterie of saint Augustine, where was deuout prayers made vnto the holy ghost, and after they had all of them requested of God so to direct the voyage, that it might be to the honor and glorie of his deuine maiestie, and to the saluation of the soules of that kingdome, whome lucyfer hath so long possessed, Omoncon and Synsay did take their leaue of the Gouernour, and of the rest, giuing them thankes for their good entertainement that they made them, and did promise them in recompence thereof to bee alwayes their assured friends, as shall appeare by his works: and to carrie them, whome he did request of his owne good will, with securitie as vnto himselfe, &amp; that he would first suffer wrong himselfe, before any should bee doone vnto those whom he had on his charge. The Gouernor and all the rest did thankfully accept his new offer, giuing him to vnderstand that they were fully perswaded that his word &amp; déede should be all one, and therewith they tooke their leaue of them and of the religious men with the two souldiers their companions, not lacking teares to be shed on both parts.
                  Then did they al imbarke themselues in a ship of the Ilands which was made readie for the same effect, and went out of the port in the company of another shippe with merchants of China that were at Manilla, into the which Sinsay put himselfe with all their victuals, for to carry it vntill they came vnto the port of Buliano, whereas was the great shippe of Omoncon, wherin they should make their voyage: which was that which was forced to returne backe againe by reason of foule wether: they aryued at the same port the sunday following, for that the winde was somewhat contrarie, and had lost the shippe that

carried their victuals: but after founde her at an anker in the port, for that she was the bigger shippe and sailed better: they founde also in her, two Spanish souldiers, whom the generall of the fielde had sent from Pagansinan, for that from the place whereas he was, he did sée the saide ship to enter into the port, with commandement for to carrie them vnto him. This did cause vnto the religious men and souldiers a suspition that the generall of the fielde woulde procure to stay them vntill such time as he did sée the ende of the siege of the fort, which euerie day was looked when they would yeelde: for that they shoulde carry with them Limahon the rouer a liue or dead. Uppon the which almost euery one gaue his iudgement, that it were better to depart without obeying his commandement, neither to take their leaue of him, but to prosecute their voyage so much desired, for they thought euerie houre of their staying to bee a whole yeare: fearing that euerie thing woulde be an impediment to disturbe their intent and purpose: but better perswading themselues, knowing the good condition and great Christianitie of the generall of the fielde, whom Frier Martin had alwayes in place of his sonne, for that he was Neuew vnto the Adelantado Legaspi, the first gouernor and discouerer of the said Philippinas whom he brought with him from Mexico being but a childe: they were agréed to go vnto him, and shewe their obedience, and to take their leaue of him and of all the rest of their friends that were in the campe. So with this determination they put their shippe into the riuer Pagansinan which was but seuen leagues from the saide port. They had not sailed thrée leagues but a contrary winde so charged them, that they were constrained to returne into the port from whence they came, and there concluded amongst themselues to send Pedro Sarmiento in the barke, wherein came the two souldiers aforesaid, for that it was little &amp; went with Oares, they might with lesse daunger enter into the riuer of Pagansinan, rowing vnder the sho

with him the interpreter that they shoulde carrie with them, which was a boy of China that was baptised in Manilla, and could speake Spanish very well: he was named Gernando. This Pedro Sarmiento came thither, and did accomplish all that was commended vnto him verie faithfully: but the Generall of the field was not therewith satisfied, neither the Captaines and souldiers that were with him, for that the father friers were very wel beloued of them, for they deserued it: so they d

                     e. They being vnderstood by the Friers (not without the suspition aforesaid) and séeing that they could not excuse to go vnto them to accomplish their commandement and gentle request: they departed out of Buliano with a faire wind, for that the storme was done, although the sea was a little troubled: and therewith they ariued at Pagansinan whereas they were well receiued of the generall of the fielde, and of all the rest with great ioy and pleasure. Their suspition fell out cleane contrarie as they thought, for that the Generall of the fielde woulde not stay them, but did dispatch them with al spéede possible, and did deliuer vnto them at the instant all such captiues as the gouernour had commanded, and the souldiers that had them did with a verie good will deliuer them, séeing to what intent it did extende, and also the interpreter with all other thinges that was necessarie and requisite for the voyage: and writ a letter vnto Omoncon who remained in Buliano, that hée woulde fauour and cherish them as he did not thinke to the contrarie: and did ratifie that which the gouernour had promised him, for to send the rouer aliue or deade, after they had ended their siege by one meanes or other. He also requested of Frier Martin de Herrada that hee would carrie with him one Nicholas de Cuenca a souldier of his company for to buy for him certaine things in China, who did accept the same with a verie good wil, and promised to intreat him as one of his owne, and haue him in as great regard: and therewith they departed and w

with him a letter vnto the captaine Omoncon, and a present of victuals and other things: and other two letters, the one for the gouernor of Chincheo and the other for the vizroy of the prouince of Ochian, wherein he doth giue them to vnderstand how that he hath burnt al the fléete of Limahon, and slaine many of his companions, and howe that he hath besieged him so straightly that it is not possible for him to escape, neither indure long without yéelding of himself: and then either aliue or dead he would send him, as the gouernor of Manilla had writ &amp; promised. These two letters were accompanied with two presents wherein was a basen and an ewre of siluer, and certaine robes of spani

                     h cloth, the which the Chinos doo estéeme very much, as also other things of great valew that they haue not in their country: &amp; crauing pardon because he did not send more. The occasion was for that he was in that place, and all his goods in the cittie of Manilla. The same day with a faire winde they came vnto the port Buliano, whereas they founde Omoncon abiding their comming, and receiued all such things as the sergeant maior did carrie him in the name of the generall of the field, and rendred vnto him great thanks, and made a new promise to accomplish that offer made vnto the gouernor.
               
               
                  CHAP. XI. The Spaniards do depart with the captain Omoncon from the port of Buliano, and ariue at the firme lande of China.
                  THe desire was so much of this father frier Martin de Herrada to be in China, as well for to preach in it the holy gospel, as also for to sée the wonders that haue béene reported to be in that countrie: that although he was dispatched by the gouernor and generall of the fielde, yet hee thought that their voyage would be interrupted: and therefore to see himselfe frée from this feare and suspition, so soone as he came vnto the port of Buliano to the captaine Omoncon, hee requested him with great vehemencie, that he would straightwayes set saile, for that the winde serued well for their purpose. Then Omoncon, who desired no other thing, but thought euery houre that he tarried to be a whole yeare, commanded forthwith the

mariners to make all thinges in a redinesse to set saile, and to bring home all their ankers, and ride apicke, r
                        •
                     die to depart after midnight: the which was done as hee had commanded. So vppon a sunday at the breake of day, being 25. of Iune, they tooke a Spaniard souldier into their company, who was called Iohn de Triana, and vsed him in their seruice, for that hee was a mariner. So at the same time after they had praied vnto God to direct their voyage,They departed towards China.
                      they set saile with a prosperous winde: there was with the Friers, souldiers and men of seruice, twentie persons besides the Chinos that were captiues, and the people of the Captaine Omoncon. They were not so soone off from the coste, but the winde abated and they remained becalmed certaine dayes: but afterwards they had a lustie gale, that carried them forwards. The Chino

They maruelled very much when that it was told them, that comming from Mexico vnto Philippinas, they were thrée monethes at the sea and neuer sawe land. So it pleased God, that although it was verie calme and little winde stirring, that we made but little way, yet vpon the sunday following, which was the thirde of Iuly, we had sight of the land of China: so that we found all our voyage from the port of Buliano, from whence we departed, vnto the firme land to be one hundred and fortie leagues, &amp; twenty leagues before they came in the sight thereof, they had sounding at thrée score and tenne, and fourscore fathome, and so waxed lesse and lesse vntill they came to the lande: which is the best and surest token they haue to be nigh the land. In al the time of their voiage the Captain Omoncon with his companie shewed such great curtesie and friendship to our men, as though they had béene the owners of the saide ship: and at such time as they did imbarke thēselues he gaue his own cabin yt was in the sterne to ye friers, and vnto Pedro Sarmiento and to Miguel de Loarcha, he gaue another cabin that was very good, &amp; cōmanded his company in the ship that they should respect them more then himselfe: the which was in such sort, that on a day at the beginning of their voyage, the fathers founde them making of sacrifice vnto

their Idols, and told them that all which they did was a kinde of mockage, and that they shoulde worshippe but onely one God: and willed them to doo so no more. Who onely in respect of them did leaue it off, and not vse it after in all the voyage: whereas before they did vse it euerie day manie times.They leaue the worshiping of one Idol to worship another. Besides this, they woulde worshippe the images that the Friers did carrie with them, and knéele vpon their knées with great shew of deuotion: who nowe hauing sight of the firme lande, in so short time, and passed that small gulfe so quietly, which was wont to bee verie perilous and full of stormes: they did attribute it vnto the orations of the Friers, their companions and souldiers. The like curtesie was shewed vnto them by Sinsay, who was the seconde person in the shippe, and hée that did best vnderstande that Nauigation and voyage. So as they drewe nearer the land, they might discouer from the sea a verie gallant and well towred Cittie, that was called Tituhul, whereas the king hath continually in garrison tenne thousande souldiers, and is vnder the gouernement of the prouince of Chincheo. So the next day following, wee came vnto a watch towre, which was situated vppon a rocke at the entrie into a bay, who had discouered our shippe, and knew the standart or flagge to bee the kings: and made a signe vnto seuen shippes which were on the other side of the point, which was part of a company ordeined for to kéepe and defende the cost, which were more then foure hundred. Straightwayes the Captaine of the seuen shippes came foorth to knowe what we were: and what chanced shalbe told you in this chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. XII. The Captaine Omoncon is come to the prouince of Chincheo, but before he doth come vnto an anker, he dooth passe some trouble with another Captaine of the sea.
                  THis Captaine Omoncon, when he saw that the ships did make towards him, hee cast about his shippe and passed alongst by the watch towre, making his way towards the towne, where he was a natural subiect and nigh at hand, being but two leagues from the point: which being perceiued bythe

generall of that bay which was in a r
                        •
                     dinesse, who imagined by his working that it should be some shippe of euill demeanor and their enimies, without any delation hee issued forth from behind the point, with thrée ships that did row with Oares verie swift: and gaue them chase, cutting them off from their pretence: and when he came nigh vnto them, hee shot at them to make them to amaine: the which Omoncon would not doo, for that hee supposed (as afterwards hee did confesse) that hee should be some man of little estimation, and not the generall of the coste. But as he drew nigher vnto him, hee did know him by the flagge he bare on the sterne, in the foist wherein he was himselfe with his souldiers, &amp; straightwayes caused to amaine his sailes, and tarried for him. The generall did the like, and stayed behinde, sending a boate for to bring the captaine vnto him and to declare what he was, and from whence hee came. Omoncon did forthwith imbarke himself into his boate without any resistance, but rather with feare that hee should be punished for that hee did flie from him. The generall when hee saw him, did straightwayes know him, (and in that the fathers did vnderstand by signes) hée was verie glad of his comming, and gaue him good entertainment.
                  This generall was a goodly man of person, and was verie well apparelled, and did sit in a chaire in the sterne of his ship, the which was all couered to kéepe away the sunne: hee commanded the captaine Omoncon to sit downe by him vpon the hatches, without chaire or any other thing, who did obey him, although first hee did refuse it with great modestie, as not woorthie to haue that honour, which was not estéemed a little. After that he was set, he gaue him to vnderstand in effect of all his voyage and successe, and in what extremitie he left Limahon, and also howe that hee carried with him the Friers and other Spaniards, which went to carrie the newes, and to intreate of peace with the vizroy of Aucheo: vnto whome, and vnto the gouernor of Chincheo hee carried presents, sent from the gouernor and generall of the fielde of the Ilands Philippinas. When the generall had heard this relation, he commanded the 
                        •
                     oate to returne and to bring them before him, that hée might sée what manner of men they were of person and the vse of the apparell: and likewise to satisfie himselfe of other

desires that came into his mind by that which Omoncon had saide of them. The fathers and their companions did obey the commandement, and did imbarke themselues in the boat
                        •
                      (although it were with some feare) and came vnto the shippe whereas the generall receiued them with great curtesie after his fashion, and shewed them a good countenance, and tokens that he very much reioyced to sée them and the vse of their apparell they ware. But after a while hee commanded that they shoulde bée put vnder hatches, which was the occasion to augment the feare they conceiued when they were sent for: and the more when they saw that they were commanded to be shut vp in a cabin, with the interpreter that they brought with them.
                  This being done, they were in great care howe they might vnderstand the Generals pretence: and at a close doore that was before the cabin whereas they were, vppon a sudden they might sée that all those that were in the shippe did arme themselues in great haste, and the captaine Omoncon amongst them: then they heard bases and hargubus shot, with a great noise of people, which did verie much alter them: in such sort that they looked euery moment when they should come and cut of their heads. Whilst that our people were in this agonie and great feare, Omoncon considered of them and of the charge that he had to bring them thither: therewith he sent one of his seruants to giue them to vnderstand of all that they had heard and séene, wherewith they did quiet themselues, and put away al the feare that they had conceiued with their suddain putting downe in the cabine, and the shooting off of those péeces. The which the better to giue you to vnderstand, I will first declare vnto you the occasion (and then after the rest.) Limahon had not so soone taken his course towards the Ilands, but straightwaies it was knowne in the kingdome of China: And the vizroy of Ochian by the order that he had from the roiall counsell, did command all gouernors of such cities that were nigh vnto the coast, to dispatch away shipping for to go follow and séeke him, with aduertisement that hee who did accomplish this diligence with the first, shuld be very wel rewarded and estéemed, for that they feared that if the rouer shuld ioine with ye 
                     Castillas (for so they do cal the Spaniards in that country,They call the Spaniards Castillias.
                      of whom they

haue had great notice) might thereby grow some great harme and inconuenience, which afterwards could not be well remedied: which was the occasion that they made the more haste, for that if it were possible to take him, or else to spoile his shiping before that he should come vnto the said Ilands. In accomplishing of this commandement the gouernor of Chincheo did prouide shipping and did sende the Captaine Omoncon with them: but yet he could not prouide them of souldiers and other necessaries till certaine dayes after that he was gone foorth: so he went till hee came and met with the Spaniards, nigh vnto Buliano (as aforesaid). About the same time the general of the bay that was there to defend the cost, did dispatch another ship for to enquire and know where the rouer was, and to bring relation therof, that straightwayes they might go and assalt him with all the whole armie. This ship was the fathers of Sinsay, he that was friend vnto the Castillas, who came in companie with the Friers from the Ilands (as it is said,) and he went in the said ship for Pilot: who although hee went out of the port with great spéede, yet with greater hast hee returned againe without mastes or yardes, for that they lost them in a great storme and torment that tooke them in the gulfe, whereas they thought to haue béene lost. At the same time that the Friers departed from Buliano to Pagansinan, being requested to come thither by the master of the field (as aforesaid) there was in the same port a ship of China that came vnto the Ilands to traficke and being well informed of all things, as well in what extremity the Spaniards had the rouer, as also of ye going of Omoncon, and how that he carried vnto the firme lande the foresaide Friers and their companions. The saide shippe departed in a morning very secretly, ten dayes before that Omoncon did make saile, &amp; came to the firme land the saide ten daies before, &amp; gaue notice thereof vnto the gouernor of all that they had vnderstood, as wel by relation as by sight: and how that ther came with Omoncon &amp; the Spaniards, Sinsay, who was he that in al things touching Limahon was the dooer, &amp; that whatsoeuer shall happen good in this relation, they ought to giue the praise and thanks vnto him, and not vnto Omoncon. This he spake for the good affection he had vnto Sinsay by way of friendship, for that he was of the same profession, a merchant.
                  
                     The Gouernour of the bay being verie desirous to haue the rewarde and thankes of the king, with occasion to say that the sonne of him whom he sent to follow and séeke Limahon was the chiefe and principall meanes of that good successe. Straight wayes so soone as hee heard the newes of the shippe that ariued there tenne dayes before (as aforesaide) he commaunded sixe shippes to goe foorth of the baye to the sea, with order and commission to bring the ship to an anker in the sayd bay, and not to suffer him to go into any other place: and otherwise they could not, at least wayes they would bring with them Sinsay, for that they would send him post vnto the Uiceroy, for to declare vnto him all that had passed particularly. These sixe ships came verie nigh vnto that wherein was the Generall aforesaid, at such time as our Spaniardes were with the Generall, and they neuer could perceiue it, for that there were many in the baye, some going and some comming: but when that hee had discouered them, then he caused our people to be put vnder hatches because they should not be séene, &amp; commanded those that were in the shippe to arme themselues for their defence if néed required. In the meane time that they made resistance with this ship, one of the sixe ships did borde that shippe wherein came Omoncon, pretending to take her, and beléeued to doo it with great 
                        •
                     ase. But it happened vnto them cleane contrarie, for that the souldiers that were within did defende their ship valiantly. Sinsay with a very good will would haue suffered the ship wherein his father came to haue carried away the other, if the souldiers of Omoncon would haue consented therunto. They did not only misse of their purpose, but also many of them were hurt in the attempting to enter the ship: the saide ship did fall aborde there whereas was their captaine Omoncon, who at that instant did call our Spaniardes in his shippe, out of the generalles shippe whereas they were: which was dooone with such spéede, that it was accomplished before any of the other ships could come vnto them, although they did procure it. Then did Omoncon arme himselfe to the warre, for to defend himselfe, his ship, and all that were therein, or to die there. The Fryers and their companions when they vnderstoode the cause of their strife and fighting, partly by suspition in that they had séene, as by that which Omoncon did sende them worde, did

offer themselues vnto him, promising him to die with him i
                        •
                      neede did so require, and requested him to appoint them what they should do, and they would accomplish it with a very good will. At this time all the ships were about that of Omoncon, who was not idle, but put foorth his artilerie for their defence, asking powder of the Spaniardes, for that they had little left: the Generall did not depart from the shippe from the time that the Spaniardes went vnto him, neither did hee remooue out of his chayre, although all the rest that were in the ship were armed.
                  At this time the Captayne of the sixe shippes of Chincheo did put himselfe in a boate and came towardes the shippe of Omoncon for to haue commoned with him, but he would not suffer them to come nigh, but shot at them, and caused them to depart against their willes, and called them all to naught from the poope of his shippe, with manie reprochfull woordes, saying that they came to steale the honour that hee with so great trauayle and perill had gotten. Then the generall séeing that he could not goe thorough with his purpose hee determined to leaue him, and therewith to cast about with his shippes, and returned into the port of the baye from whence they came. This brought in his shippe a sonne of Sinsay, to giue occasion vnto his father for to come vnto him, and likewise his owne father, whome they did straightwayes put in prison and his wife and mother: which is a thing commonly vsed in that countrie, the children to pay for their parentes▪ and to the contrarie the parents for the children.
                  
                     Sinsay who feared the same, woulde not goe vnto his owne house till such time as he did carrie commandement from the Uiceroy, for to deliuer out of prison those that were put there without desert: the which was granted by the Uiceroy, with other fauours, and great honour as shall bee declared vnto you.
               
               
                  CHAP. XIII. Omoncon doth disembarke himselfe with our Spaniardes in the port of Tanfuso, and are verie well receiued by the Iustice, and made verie much of by the order of the Insuanto of that prouince.
                  
                     WIthin a little while after that the Captayne of the sixe shippes departed for Chincheo, Omoncon and his companie ariued at the port of Tanfuso hard by, vpon wednesday in the euening, being the fift day of Iuly. This Tanfuso is a gallant and fresh towne of foure thousand housholders, and hath continually a thousand souldiers in garrison, and compassed about with a great and strong wall, and the gates fortified with plates of yron, the foundations of all the houses are of lime &amp; stone, and the walles of lime and yearth, and some of bricke: their houses within very fairely wrought with great courts, their stréetes faire and brode all paued. Before that Omoncon did come vnto an anker, they sawe all the souldiers and the people of the towne were gathered together vpon the rockes that were ioyning vnto the port, all armed readie vnto the battaile, amongst whom there was a principall captaine, &amp; thrée more of his companions, that were sent him by the Gouernor of Chincheo, whom they do call in their language Insuanto, who had vnderstāding of the cōming of Omoncon &amp; his companie by the ship (aforesaid) he sent thē thither before, that in his name should entertain them &amp; cherish them all that was possible. When the ship entred into the port Omoncon did salute the towne with certain péeces of artilery &amp; discharged all his hargubushes sixe times about, &amp; therwithal tooke in their saile, and let anker fall. Then straightwaies the captaine whō the Insuanto had sent, came abord the ship, who had expresse cōmission, not to leaue the company of our people after that they were disembarked till such time as they came whereas he was, but to beare them companie, and to prouide them of all thinges necessarie: the which he did accomplish.
                  All these captaines and ministers of the king doo weare certaine ensignes for to be knowen from the common people, who are not permitted to weare any such, and they can not goe abroad in publike without the same, neyther will they if they might, for that by them they are obeyed and reuerenced, as well in the stréetes as in any other place where they come: all such generally be called Loytias, which is as much to say in our language (Gentlemen):Ensignes to knowe the Iustices. the particular ensignes which they doo vse, bee broade wastes or girdles embossed after diuerse manners: some of golde and siluer, some of the

shell of a Turtuga or Turtell, and of a swéete wood, and other some of Iuerie, the higher estates hath them embrodered with pearles and precious stones, and their bunnets with two long eares, and their buskins made of satten and vnshorne veluet, as we haue declared more at large in the first thrée bookes.
                  Then after, so soone as they were come to an anker in the port, the Iustice did send them a license in writing for to come foorth of the shippe, as a thing necessarie, for that without it the waiters or guardes of the water side, will not suffer them to put foote a land. This licence was written vpon a borde whited, and firmed by the Iustice, whose charge it is to giue the licence. Then when they came a shoore, there were the souldiers that were appointed by the Insuanto in a readinesse to beare them companie,
                        
                           •

                           •
                        ing of the Fryers. and did direct and leade them vnto the kinges houses of the sayde Citie: the like hath euerie Citie almost thoroughout all the kingdome, &amp; there they did lodge them. These houses are very great and very wel wrought and gallant, with faire courtes belowe, and galleries aboue: they had in them stanges or pondes of water full of fish of sundrie sortes.
                  The Insuanto had giuen order vnto the Iustice of Tansuso, wherein he had ordained what hee should giue them to eate▪ and all other things that should be done particularly by it selfe without lacking ofany thing, and appointed the Captaine that he with his souldiers should not depart from them not a iot, but alwaies to beare them company whethersoeuer they went, and not to depart till he had farther order from him: in accomplishing whereof they remayned with them that night in the kings house. The Iustice of the citie when that he had lodged them, went himselfe in person to the waters side, and caused all their stuffe to be vnladen out of the ship, and caused it to be carried with great care and diligence vnto the Fryers, whereas they were.
                  The people of the citie did presse very much to sée these strangers, so that with the presse as also with the great heate they were marueilously afflicted: which being perceiued by the Iustice, he gaue order that they might bee eased of that trouble, &amp; caused sergeants to kéepe the doore, and their yeomen to make resistance against the people. Yet notwithstanding, though they did not trouble them so much they ranged round about the

house, and clymed vpon the walles to procure to sée them, as a rare thing, for that they came from countries so farre off, and apparelled verie different from that they do vse, or otherwise haue séene. So when that the night was come, the Iustice of the citie did make them a banket according vnto the fashion of the countrie: and it was in this manner following.
                  They were carried into a hall that was verye curiously wrought, wherein were many torches and waxe candles light, and in the middest therof was set for euerie one of the guests a table by himselfe, as is the vse &amp; fashion of that countrie,The vse of their bankets (which more at large shalbe de
                        •
                     lared) euerie table had his couering of damaske or satten very well made, the tables were gallantly painted, without any table clothes, neither do they vse any, for they haue no néede of them, for that they do eate all their victualles with two little stickes made of golde and siluer, and of a marueilous odiferous woode, and of the length of little forkes as they doo vse in Italy, with the which they doo féede themselues so clenly, that although their victuals be neuer so small, yet do they let nothing fall, neither foule their hands nor faces: they were set downe at these tables in verie good order, and in gallant chayres, in such sort that although they were euerie one at his table by himselfe, yet they might see and talke one with an other, they were serued with diuerse sortes of cates, and very well dressed both of flesh and fish, as gamons of bacon, capons, géese, whole hennes, and péeces of beefe, and at the last many little baskets full of swéete meates made of suger, and marchpanes all wrought very curiously. They gaue them wine of an indifferent colour and taste, made of the palme trée,Wine of a palme tree. (whereof there is no other vsed in all that countrie) our Spaniardes did vse it, as that which was made of grapes. All the time that the supper indured, there was in the hall great store of musicke of diuers instruments, whereon they played with great consort, some one time and some an other. The instruments which they commonly do vse are hoybuckes, cornets, trompets, lutes, such as be vsed in Spaine, although in the fashion ther is some difference. There was at this banket (which indured a great while) the captaine that was ordained for their garde, and the captaine Omoncon and Sinsay. When supper was done, they were carried into very faire chambers, wheras

were faire beddes, where they slept and eased themselues.
                  The next day following in the morning, was brought vnto them their ordinarie victualles, and that in abundance, as we
                        •
                     l of flesh as of fish, fruits and wine, to be dressed vnto their owne content, and according vnto their manner: they would take nothing for the same, for so they were commanded by the Insuantes. This was brought vnto them euerie day so long as they were there, and in the way when as they went vnto Chincheo. The same day ariued a Captaine of fortie ships in the same port, and so soone as hee was a shore, hee went straightwayes vnto the pallace for to sée the strangers: who being aduertised of his comming, came foorth and receiued him at the pallace gate, where as was vsed betwixt them great courtesie. The Captayne came with great maiestie, with his guarde of Souldiers and mase bearers before him, with great musicke of hoybuckes, trumpets and drommes, and two whiffelers, or typp staues, that made roome putting the people aside: also there came with him two executors of Iustice or hangmen, hauing each of them in their handes a set made of canes, which is an instrument wherewith they doo whippe and punish offenders, and is so cruell that who soeuer doth receiue sixtie strokes with the same, although he be a verie stout man and strong hearted yet it will kill him, for that hee is not able to abide it. They doo beate them vppon the 
                        •
                     highes and calues of the legges, causing the offender or patient to lye downe vppon his breast or stomacke and commande their heades and legges to be holden. The Iudges, Captaines, and Loytias haue ordinarily these officers before them, for to beate such as will not goe out of the way when as they doo passe the stréetes, and such as will not alight from their horse, or come out of their close chayres when they doo méete with them. When this Captayne came vnto the Pallace gate, whereas the father Fryers and their companions did receiue him, he was brought on the shoulders of eight men very richly apparelled, and he in a chayre wrought of Iuorie and golde, who stayed not till they came into the inner chamber, whereas he did a light from the chayre, and went straight vnder a cloth of estate, that was there ordinarily for the same purpose, and a table before him: there hee sate downe, and straightwaies

arose vp, and standing he did receiue the strange guests, who did curtesie vnto him according vnto their fashion, which is to ioyne their handes together, and to stoope with them and their heads downe to the grounde: he gratified them againe, with bowing his heade a little, and that with great grauitie. Within a little while after he spake vnto them with great maiestie, bidding them welcome into his kingdome, being glad of their cōming, saying that himselfe was come to sée &amp; cherish thē for that they should receiue no discontent, as ye proofe shal shew. These spéeches being finished, there was brought foorth certain péeces of blacke silke of twelue vares long a péece. And his officers did put on the Fryers shoulders each of them two, which was for either shoulder one, and was brought about their bodies &amp; girt therewith: the like was done in order vnto the spanish souldiers and vnto Omoncon and Sinsay and to their interpreter. But vnto Omoncon and Sinsay was giuen vnto either of them a branch or nosegay made of siluer which was set vpon their heads, which is accustomable honor that is done vnto such as haue done some great enterprise, or such like.
                  After that this ceremonie was done, they played vpon the instrumentes afore sayde which came with the Captaine. In the meane time of their musicke, there was brought foorth great store of conserues, marchpanes and thinges made of suger, and excellent good wine: and so being on foot standing, hee caused them to eate, and he himselfe from the chayre whereas he sate did giue them to drinke euerie one in order, without rising vp, which is a ceremonie and token of great fauour, and of loue.
                  This being done, hee arose from the chayre vnder the cloth of state, and went and sate downe in that which was brought on mens backes, and with declining of his head a little he departed out of the hall and out of the house, and went vnto his owne house, whereas by the counsell of Omoncon and Sinsay within an houre after they shoulde goe and visite him, the which they did: hee receiued them marueilously well and with great courtesie: who maruelled at his great maiestie and authoritie, for that Omoncon and Sinsay when they did talke with him were vpon their knees, and so did al the rest: yet that which they did see afterwardes done vnto the Insuanto and viceroy, was much more.
                  
                     He gaue them againe in his owne house a gallant banket, of diuerse sortes of conserues and fruits, and excellent wine of the palme trée, and did talke and reason with them in good sort, and was more familiar than at his first visitation, demanding of them many thinges in particular, and beholding their apparayle and garmentes, with showe of great content and reioycing.

                  At their going foorth of the towne they were accompanied with a great number of souldiers, both hargubushes and pikes, and before them a great noyse of trompets, drommes, and hoybuckes, till such time as they came vnto the riuers side, whereas was a brygandine prouided and made readie in all pointes to carrie them vp the riuer: all the stréetes alongest whereas they went, there followed them so much people that it was innumerable, and all to sée them. So when they were embarked, the which was done with great speede to auoyd the presse of the people, there came vnto them the Captaine of the 
                        •
                     ortie ships, of whom wee made mention in the Chapter past, with thrée byrgandines, one wherein he was himselfe, and was marueylously well trimmed: and in the other two were souldiers that did beare him companie. As soone as he came vnto them, hee straight wayes entred into the brygandine whereas the religious men were with three Spaniardes, and brought with him great store of conserues, and made them a gallant banket, the which did indure so long as he was with them, which was the space of rowing of two long leagues, in which time their pleasure

was such that they thought it but a quarter of a league. From thence he departed from them and returned, but left many thinges behinde him for their comfort in their iourney, and made great offers, with an outward showe, that it was a griefe vnto him to depart from out of their companie.
                  All alongest the ryuers whereas they went, was seated with villages verie gallant and fresh, both on the one side and on the other. Some of them did content our people verie much, who asked the names howe they were called, and the Captaynes answered them and sayde, that those were villages that did not deserue the honour of a name, but when you doo come there whereas the king is, you shall see Cities, that it shall be a woorthie thing to knowe their names, the which townes haue thrée and foure thousande souldiers, such as in Europe are estéemed for reasonable Cities.
                  At the end of the two leagues, there whereas the Captaine did leaue the companie of our Spaniardes in the riuer, they came vnto a great baye, whereas was at an anker a fléete of more then a hundreth and fiftie shippes men of warre, whose Generall was this Captaine, whom we haue spoken of, that did beare the Fryers and the rest companie. At such time as the fléete did discouer them, they began to salute them, as well with great péeces of artilerie, as with hargubushes, and other kinde of pastimes, which commonly they do vse at such times: and that is doone by the commandement of their Generall.
                  At such time as they had made an ende of shooting and other pastimes, then did he take his leaue of them with the ceremonie aforesaide, and went out of the brygandine whereas the Fryers were and went into his owne, which carryed him vnto the Admirall wherein he imbarked himselfe. Our Spaniardes after his departure did trauaile vp the riuer more than thrée leagues, hauing continually both on the one side and on the other verie many and faire townes, and full of people. In the ende of the thrée leagues they went a lande halfe a league from the Towne of Tangoa, whereas straightwayes all such things as they carried with them were takē vpon mens backs, and carried it vnto the towne before them, whereas they were tarying their comming, for to giue them great entertaynement. At their going a shore, they founde prepared for the

two religious men little chayres to carrie them vppon mens backes, and for the souldiers and the rest of their companions, was ordayned horse. The fathers did refuse to be carried, and would haue gone a foote, for that the way was but short and pleasant, full of gréene trées, and againe for humilitie, refusing to be carried in so rich chaires and vppon mens backes of so good a vocation as they séemed to be. But Omoncon and the other Captaine would not consent thereunto, saying, that it was the order giuen by the Insuanto, and that they could not by any meanes breake but performe in all points, or else to be cruelly punished for the same, I meane such captaines as had the charge for to garde &amp; beare them companie: and that no excuse could serue thē, and againe that it was conuenient so to be done, for yt from that time the Chinos should respect them and vnderstande that they were principall persons, for yt they were carried vpon mens backes, as they do their Loytias. The fathers obeyed their reasons, and entred into the chayres &amp; were carried with eight men a péece, &amp; the other their cōpanions with foure men a péece, according vnto the order giuen by the gouernor. Those that carried the chaires, did it with so good a will, yt there was striuing who should first lay hands to them. This towne of Tangoa hath thrée thousand souldiers, and is called in their language Coan: at the entring in, it hath many gardens &amp; orchards &amp; a stréete where through they carried the Spaniards vnto their lodging, they affirmed it to be halfe a league long, &amp; all the stréete whereas they went, it was full of bordes &amp; stalles where on was laide all kinde of marchandice very curious, and things to be eaten, as fresh fish &amp; salt fish of diuers sortes, &amp; great abundance of 
                        •
                     oule, and flesh of al sorts, fruits and gréene herbs in such quantitie that it was sufficient to serue such a Citie as Siuell is. The presse of people was so much in the stréets, that although there were many typstaues, &amp; souldiers that did make way wheras they went, yet could they not passe but with great difficultie. So they were brought vnto the kings house, which was very great, marueilously wel wrought with stone &amp; brick, and many halles, pa
                        •
                     lers, and chambers, but none aboue but all belowe. So soone as they were afoote, there was brought from the Captaine or Iustice of the towne, whom they doo call Ticoan, a message, bidding them welcome, &amp; therwith a present

which was great store of capons, hens, teales, ducks, géese, flesh of four or fiue sorts, fresh fish, wine, and fruits of diuers sorts, &amp; of so great quantitie that it was sufficient for two hundreth men. All the which they would haue giuen for a little coole aire, by reason that it was then very hoat wether, &amp; againe the great number of people yt came thether to sée them did augment it the more. So in the euening the two spanish souldiers wēt forth into the stréets to walk abrode, &amp; left the two Fryers within their lodging, vnto whō afterwards they did giue intelligence of all things that they had séene, which did cause great admiratiō: the wall of the towne was very brode, &amp; wrought with lyme and stone, full of loope holes and watch towers. And as they passed through the stréetes there came foorth of a house a very honest man as it séemed, who was very well apparelled &amp; stayed them for that in the same house there were certaine dames principall personages, that did sée them a farre off, and not content therewith, they did request them with great courtesie for to enter into the house that they might the better sée thē: the which they did straightwaies accomplish, and entring in, they were brought into a court, whereas was set chayres for them to sit downe, and the Ladies were there a little frō them beholding them with great honestie and grauitie. Then a little after they sent them a banket with marchpanes and sweet meats made of sugar, which they did eate without any curiositie &amp; dronke after the same. The banket being done, they made signes and tokens vnto thē, that they receiued great content with their sight, and that they might depart when yt their peasure was, the which they did after yt they had made great curtesies with thankes for their friendship receiued of both parts. So after they had taken their leaue they went to see a house of pleasure yt was hard by ye town wall, wrought vpon the water, with verie faire galleries &amp; open lodges for to banket in, made of masons worke, &amp; therin many tables finely painted, &amp; round about it sesterns of water wherin was store of fish, &amp; ioyning vnto thē tables of very faire alabaster, all of one stone, and the least of them was of eight spannes long: and rounde about them were brookes of running water, that gaue a pleasaunt sounde in the meane time they were banketting, and nigh thereunto many gardynes full of all sortes of flowers. And a little from that place they

sawe a bridge all of Masons worke, and the stones verie well wrought and of a mightie biggnesse, they measured some of them, that were twentie and two and twentie foote long, and fiue foote brode, and séemed vnto them that it was a thing impossible to be layde there by mans handes. Of this bignesse, yea and bigger they did sée layde vppon manie other bridges, in the discourse of their voyage going to Chincheo and Au
                        
                           •
                        heo. In this towne they tarried and rested themselues all that night, marueiling verie much at that which they had seene. The next day in the morning when they were vp and readie, they found in the house all thinges in a readinesse and in verie good order, for their departure, as well their little chayres, and horse, as for men to carrie their stuffe and apparell, which did not a little make them to marueile, how that euerie one of thē with a waster vpon their shoulders, did deuide their burden in two partes, sixe roues before and sixe roues behinde, and did trauaile with the same with so great ease and swiftnes that the horse could not indure with them. They went vnto the Ticoan his house, he who sent them the present ouer night, to giue him thankes for his courtesie, and to take their leaue of him. They found him with great maiestie, but yet gaue them great &amp; good entertainment, and craued pardon at their hands, if that he did not giue them the entertainement and courtesie as they deserued. He did likewise put vpon each of them two péeces of silke, in the same order as the gouernour of Tansuso did. So when they had surrendred vnto him thankes, they tooke their leaue and departed from Chincheo whereas was the Insuanto or gouernor, by whose order was showed vnto them all the courtesie as you haue hearde.
               
               
                  CHAP. XV. The Spaniardes doo prosecute their iourney to Chincheo, and seeth many notable thinges by the way.
                  FRom this towne of Tangoa vnto Chincheo is thirteene leagues, and so plaine way that it giueth great content to trauaile it: in all the waye they could not see one spanne of ground but was tilled and occupied. The like they doo saye is of all the grounde that is in the whole kingdome: it is

full of people, and the townes one so néere to an other, that almost you can not iudge them to bee manie townes but one, for that there was but a quarter of a league distant one towne from an other, and it was tolde vnto them that in all the Prouinces of the kingdome, it is populared in the same order. All their ground they till is watered, which is the occasion of the frutefulnesse thereof, so that they doo gather fruite all the yeare long, and our Spaniardes did sée in all places whereas they came, that they were gathering of rice, some newe sprong vp, some with eares, and some rype. They doo plough and till their ground with kine, Bufalos, and bulles, which are verie tame, and although they be great, yet be their hornes but of a spanne long and turning backwards to the tayle, in such sort that they can not do any hurt or harme with them: they do gouerne them with a corde that is made fast to a ring that is in their nose, and in like sort do they gouerne the Bufanos. They doo féede them commonly in the fieldes of rice, for that they haue no other grasinges, and all the time that they are féeding a boy doth ride on euerie one of them to disturbe them, that they doo no harme therein. But to eate the wéedes and grasse that doo grow in the rice. In this prouince and all the rest of the fiftéene in that kingdome, they gather much wheate, and excellent good barley, péese, Borona, Millo, Frysoles, Lantesas, Chiches, and other kindes of graines and séedes, whereof is great abundance and good cheape. But the chiefest thing that they do gather and a victuall that is most vsed amongest them and the borderers there aboutes is rice.
                  All the hie waies are couered with the shadowe of verie faire orchardes which do garnish it verie much, and they are planted in verie good order: and amongest th
                        •
                     m there are shoppes, whereas is solde all manner of fruites, to the comfort of all such as doo trauaile by the way, which is an infinite number, some on foote, some on horsebacke and others in little chayres. Their waters by the hie waies are verie good and light, although the wether at that time was verie hoat, especially at noone time, yet was the water of their welles and fountaynes verie coole. The same day when they had trauayled halfe way, they saw a farre off comming marching towardes them in verye good order, a squadron of souldiers, which at the first

caused them to maruaile, and to be a fraide, till such time as they drewe nigher, it was tolde vnto them, that it was the Captayne of the garde vnto the Insuanto or Gouernour of Chincheo, who came by his order to receiue them with foure hundred souldiers verie well armed with pickes and hargubushes, and well apparelled. So soone as the Captaine came vnto them, he was mounted on a bay horse, but of small stature, as they for the most part bee in all that prouince, hee alighted and came vnto the fathers, and his companions (who likewise did alight from their little chayres) and did salute the one the other with great courtesie. And the Captayne tolde them, how that the Gouernour did sende him with those souldiers for to receiue him and to beare him companie, and howe that hee was in the Citie tarrying their comming with great desire to sée them, and commaunded that with all spéede possible they should shorten the way.
                  The Captaine came verie well apparelled with a chayne of golde about his necke, a man of a good audacitie and vnderstanding. Harde vnto his stirryp hee had a page that went with him and carried a great Tira sol,
                     A thing to keepe away the sunne. made of silke that did shadowe him all ouer. The bunnet that this Captaine did weare, was like vnto them that before they had séene others weare: hee had before him great musicke of trompets and hoybukes wheron they played in great concorde. This Captaine with his foure hundreth souldiers did continually garde them, till they came vnto the Citie of Chincheo, and neuer departed from them a iot: the which was done more for pompe, and to showe their maiestie then of necessitie: for that although the people are infinite &amp; without number,The people of the countrie weare no weapons, but the souldiers. yet do they weare no weapons, for that they are commanded by the lawe of the countrie to the contrarie vpon paine of death, of what state or degrée so euer he be, but onely the souldiers such as are in euerie towne for the gard thereof, and the garrisons that the king hath continually readie to come foorth when that any occasion shall serue.
                  In this hie way continually there went and came manye packe horses, laden with m
                        •
                     rchandice and other thinges, but the most parte of them were Mules. The hie wayes are verie brode, that twentie men may ride together on a ranke and one not hinder an other, and are all paued with great stones:

and they say that the wayes thoroughout all the other Prouinces be in the same order, and was done by a king of that countrie, who spent vpon the same a great part of his treasure. And it séemeth to be true, for that our Spaniards traueling in that countrie ouer high and mightie mountaines, yet did they finde the waies plaine, in such sort as hath béene told you.
               
               
                  CHAP. XVI. Our Spaniardes ariued at the Citie of Chincheo, whereas they were receiued and lodged, and what they sawe in that Citie.
                  VPon a Saterday being the eleuenth of Iuly came our Spaniards vnto the citie of Chincheo four houres before it was night. This citie is of the common sorte in that kingdome, and may haue seuentie thousande housholdes. It is of great traficke and well prouided of all things,
                        Chincheo hath seuentie thousand housholds. for that the sea is but two leagues from it: it hath a mightie riuer running alongest by it downe into the sea, by which is brought by water and carried downe all kinde of marchandice. There is a bridge ouer the sayde riuer, which is supposed to bee the fayrest that is in all the worlde: it hath a drawe bridge to serue in time of warres or for any other necessitie: the bridge is eight hundreth paces long, and all wrought with stones of two and twentie foote long, and fiue foote broade, a thing greatly to bee marueiled at: at the entrie thereof there were manie armed souldiers readie to fight, who when they came within hargubush shoote did salute them in verie good order. There was nigh vnto the sayde bridge in the riuer riding at an anker more than a thousande shippes of all sortes,A thousand ships in one riuer. and so great a number of boates and barkes that all the riuer was couered, and euerie one full of people that had entred into them for to sée the Castillas, for so they did call the Spaniardes in that countrie, for the stréetes in the suburbes nor in the Citie could not hold them, the number was so great, yet their streets are as broade as our ordinarie streetes in anye Citie in all Spaine.
                  This Citie is compassed with a strong wall, made of stone, and is seuen fadam hie, and foure fadam broade, and vpon the

gates many towers wherein is placed their artilerie,They haue no vse of castles. which is all their strength, for that they doo not vse in their kingdome strong castels as they doo in Europe. The houses of the Citie are all built after one sorte and fashion, but faire, and not verie hie,Earth quaks in this countrey. by reason of the earth quakes which are ordinarily in that countrie.
                  All the stréetes (but especially that wherein they passed at their comming thether) haue on the one side and on the other, sheddes,Rich marchandice. vnder the which are shoppes, full of riche marchandice and of great value and verie curious. They haue in equal distance the one from the other, many triumphant arches which doo set out the stréetes verie much, and is vsed in euerie principall streete thorough out all the kingdome,Triumphant arches. in the which they haue excellent market places, whereas is to bee bought all thinges that you will desire to be eaten, as well of fish as of fleshe, fruites, herbes, comfits, conserues, and all thinges so good cheape, that it is almost bought for nothing. Their victualles are verie good and of great substance, their hogges flesh whereon they doo féede much, is so holsome and good as the mutton in Spaine. The fruites that wee did sée, some were like vnto them we haue in Spaine, and others neuer the like séene by vs afore, but of an excellent taste and sauour. But in especiall one kinde of fruite which is bigger than a muske million, but of the same fashion, but of maruellous excellent and precious victuall and pleasant to be eaten, a kinde of plummes that is of a gallant taste, and neuer hurteth anie bodie although they eate neuer so manie, a thing prooued by our Spaniardes many times. The stréete that they came in at, was so full of people, that if a graine of wheate had béene throwne amongest them, it would scarce haue fallen to the grounde. And although they were carried in little chayres vpon mens backes, and the Captaine (of whome we speake of) before them making way: yet were they a great while before they could passe the stréete, and be brought vnto a great house, which was a couent, wherein dwelt religious men of that countrie, thether they were brought and lodged, beeing verie wearie of the presse of people that did trouble them verie much with desire to take their ease.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XVII. The gouernor of Chincheo doth call the Spaniards before him, and sheweth vnto them the ceremonies that they must vse to haue aundience.
                  THe same day that they came into the cittie (as aforesaide) was a good while before night, with more desire to take rest and ease themselues of their iourney, and of the trauell they had in the stréets, by reason of the great number of people that came to sée them, then to make any visitation that night: but the Insuanto or gouernor of the cittie did send and commanded that forthwith they shoulde go vnto his house, for that hee had great desire to sée them: the which they did more for necessitie of the time, then for any good will. They went forth from their lodging on foote, whether it was for that the gouernors house was néere hande, or else peraduenture at his commandement, which they could not well vnderstande, but did as the captaine that guarded them did commande. In the midst of the stréete, wheras was no lesse number of people then in the other, wherby they entred into the Citie, they met with a Loytia that came to entertaine them with great maiestie, and had carried before him manie banners, mase bearers and tipstaues, and others which carried settes or whips, which they did traile after them made fast vnto long stickes, which were the executioners, the which doo go alwayes making of way, parting the people before the Loytias, as you haue hearde. The maiestie and company wherewith he came was so great, that they verely did beléeue him to be the Insuanto: but being certified, they vnderstoode that it was one of his counsailers that came from the gouernors home to his owne house, which was in the same stréet whereas hee met with them. This counsailor was carried in a chaire of Iuory, garnished with gold and with curtines of cloth of golde, and on them the kings armes, which are certaine serpents knotted togither (as hath béene tolde you.) But when he came right against the spaniards, without any staying he made a signe with his head, and commanded that they should returne backe againe vnto his house, which was hard by: the captains did straightways obey his commandement, and returned with

them. The counsailor entred into his house, which was verie faire, he had in it a faire court, and therein a gallant fountaine and a garden. After him entred the spaniards all alone, the rest remained without in the stréet at the Loytias commandement, he entertained them with verie good wordes of semblance, and saide in conclusion that they were welcome into that kingdome, with many other wordes of curtesie: vnto the which they answered with the same curtesie, with signes and by their interpreter that they carried with them. This Loytia commaunded a banquet to bee brought foorth, and wine to drinke, hee began first both to eate and drinke. Then hee commanded to call in the captaine, vnto whome was giuen the charge to beare them companie, and did chide with him verie sharpely and seuerely, because he did carrie them on foote (they coulde not vnderstande whether it were doone for a policie, or of a trueth, although the effectes wherewith hee did chide séemed of a trueth) hee straightwayes commaunded two rich Chayres to bée brought foorth for to carrie the Fathers, and to giue vnto their companions horses: the which being done, he willed them to go and visite the gouernor, who did tary their comming: and that another time at more leasure he would sée and visite them.
                  They followed their way all alongst the stréete, which séemed vnto them to be more fairer then the other wherein they entered, and of more fairer houses and triumphant arkes: and also the shoppes that were on the one side and on the other, to bee better furnished with richer thinges then the others, in so ample sort, that what therewith, as also the great number of people which they sawe, they were so amased, that they were as people from themselues, thinking it to be a dreame. To conclude, after they had gone a good while in that stréete, delighting their eies with newe thinges neuer séene of them before: they came into a great place, whereas were many souldiers in good order with their hargabushes, pickes and other armour in a redinesse, apparelled all in a liuerie of silke, with their ancients displayed. At the end of this place, was there a very faire and sumpteous pallace, the gate was wrought of masons worke of stone, very great &amp; full of figures or personages, and aboue it a great window with an iron grate al guilt: they

were carried within the gates, the souldiers &amp; the people which were without number, remained without and coulde not be auoyded but with great difficultie. When they were within the first court, there came forth a man very well apparelled and of authoritie, and made signes with his hande vnto them that brought the Spaniards, that they should carrie them into a hal that was vpon the right hand, the which was straightwayes done. The hall was very great &amp; faire, &amp; at the end therof there was an altar, whereon was many Idols, &amp; all did differ the one from the other in their fashion: the altar was rich and very curiously trimm
                        •
                     d with burning lampes: the aultar cloth was of cloth of gold, and the fruntlet of the same.
                  After a while that they had béene there whereas the Idols were: there came a seruant from the gouernor and saide vnto them in his behalfe, that they shoulde sende vnto him the interpreter, for that hee woulde talke with him, and tell him some things that they ought to obserue, if they would haue any audience of him: they straightwayes commanded him to go. And the gouernor said vnto him that hee should aduise the fathers and the rest of his companions, that if they would talke &amp; treate of such businesse as they came for▪ that it must be done with the same ceremonie and respect, as the Nobles of that prouince do vse to talke with him: which is vppon their knées (as afterwards they did sée manie times vsed) if not that they shoulde depart vnto the house whereas they were lodged, and there to tarrie the order that shoulde bee sent from the vizroy of Aucheo.
                  
                  The Spaniards when they hearde this message, there was amongst them diuers iudgementes and opinions, striuing amongst themselues a good while, but yet in conclusion, the religious Fathers, whome the gouernour of the Ilandes had ordeined and sent as principalles in this matter, and whose iudgemente they shoulde followe, saide that they ought to accept the condition, seeing that by no other meanes they coulde not come vnto that they pretended: and not to leaue it it off for matters of small importance, for that therein they make no offence vnto GOD, and it may bee a meane vnto the conuerting of that mightie kingdome, whome the diuell maketh reckoning to bee his owne, and

not nowe to leaue it off, but rather to procure all meanes that may be, as they had begun to do, and seeing that it is no offence vnto God, as aforesaide, neither sent as ambassadors from the king of Spaine, I doo not know to the contrarie, but that wee may consent vnto the will of the Insuant, and in especiall being a thing so commonly vsed in that countrie. This opinion and iudgement was followed, although the souldiers that were with them were of a contrarie opinion: so they sent answere vnto the gouernor with the said interpreter, that they will obserue their accustomed ceremonies, and will do all that he will commande them according vnto the custome of the countrie: otherwise they could not be permitted to intreat of such things, wherefore they came thither, from farre countries and with so great trauell.
               
               
                  CHAP. XVIII. The Spaniards haue a louing and fauorable audience of the gouernor of Chincheo, to whom they do giue the letters they brought from the Ilands Philippinas.
                  WHen that the Insuanto vnderstood that the spaniards woulde enter with the reuerence accustomed, and in such order as was declared vnto them, hee straightwaies commanded that they should come into the hall whereas he was, which was a thing to be séene, as well for the bignes, as for the riches that was in it, the which I do let passe because I would not be tedious. The spaniards were carried foorth out of that hall whereas they were first, and after that they had passed the court whereas they came in, they entred into another hall as bigge as the first: whereas were many souldiers with their weapons in their hands in verie good order, and richly apparelled, and next vnto them were many tipstaues and sergeants, with different ensignes or badges, all apparelled with long robes of silke, garded and embroidered with gold, and euery one of them had a helme on his heade, some of siluer and other some of tynne guilt ouer, which was a gallant thing to sée: all had long haire and dyed yealow, which hong downe behinde their eares vpon their backes: they were placed in very good order, and made a lane that the Spaniards might passe thorough:

then they came into a gallerie, which was ioyning vnto the chamber where the gouernor was, and there they heard such a noise of instruments of diuerse sorts, which indured a good while, and was of so great melodie, that it séemed vnto them that they neuer before heard the like: which caused vnto them great admiration to see so great maiestie amongst Gentiles.Great mai

                        stie. When the musicke was ended they entered into the hall aforesaid, and had not gone many steps, when as they met with the counsailer that met with them in the stréete aforesaid, and with him other two of his companions all on foote and bare headed before the gouernor, &amp; their ensignes of maiestie left off: which is generally vsed in all the kingdome, the inferior to make anie shewe when that hee is before his superior. Then they made signes vnto them for to knéele downe, for that the Insuanto was nigh at hande in a rich tower, vnder a canapie of great riches, and did represent so great maiestie as the king himselfe: he did entertaine them with tokens of great loue, and humanitie, and tolde them by their interpreter, that they were verie well welcome, and that he did greatly reioyce to sée them, with many other words of great fauour. This gouernor was a man of goodly person, well fauored, and of a merrie countenance, more then any that they had séene in all that countrie. He caused to be put vpon the shoulders of the fathers and of the souldiers

                     hat were with him, euery one of them two péeces of silke, which was crossed about them like skarfes, and likewise to either of them a branch of siluer: the like curtesie he did vnto the captaine Omoncon, and vnto Sinsay, and commanded to giue vnto all their seruants euery one of them a mantle of cotton painted. This ceremonie is vsed in that kingdome vnto al captaines and other men that haue done some valiant exploit, (as we haue tolde you before.) This being doone, the fathers did giue vnto him the letters which they carryed from the gouernor and generall of the fielde, and a note of the present that was sent him: crauing pardon for that it was so smal, but time and oportunitie would not serue as then to sende vnto him a thing of greater price and valor: certifying him, that if the friendship which they pretended did go forwards, &amp; come to be established, that then all things should be amended and amplified. He answered vnto their profers with words of great fauor, and made

signes vnto them to arise, and to go and take their rests, there whereas they were lodged: the which they did, and sounde all thinges in verie good order and well furnished, as well of beddes as of all other ne

                     essaries, which was done by the commandement of the gouernour. Before they departed out of the pallace, the captaine of the guard did carrie them vnto his lodging, which was within the court, and there he made them a banquet with conserues, and fruits in abundance: the which being doone, hee and other Gentlemen of the pallace did beare them companie vntill they came to their lodgings, which they greatly desired, for that they were wery of their iourney, &amp; also with the trouble of the great presse of people that pressed on thē in the stréets and otherwise for to sée them: the which captaine of the guard did appoint a company of souldiers for to gard thē both night and day, the which was done more for maiesty then for necessitie or securitie of their persons. They had a steward appointed to prouide them and all their company of all thinges necessarie, and that in abundance, and not to take of them any thing, which was giuen by particular commandement by the gouernour.
               
               
                  CHAP. XIX. The Spaniards are visited by the principals of Chincheo, the gouernor did send for Pedro de Sarmiento and Myguel de loarcha, and giueth them particular audience, and doth wel informe himselfe of all things touching Limahon the rouer.
                  THe next day following, which was sunday the twelfth of Iuly, many of the Gentlemen of the cittie did go vnto the Spaniards to visite them, vsing many ceremonies according to their custome with fauorable words, promising to performe it in déeds, when as néede did so require: and such as could not go themselues did send their seruants, bidding them welcome and to knowe of their good healthes, and howe they did like of their citties and country. The Spaniards did make answere, and gratified them all, as well those that came in person, as the other that sent their seruants: in the which visitation they spent all the whole day, hauing great admyration to sée the good behauior,

nurture, and gallant demeanure of those Gentlemen, and the great discreation they had in the demanding of anie thing they would knowe, as also in their answers made to our requests. The next day the Insuanto sent a commandement wherein he willed the two fathers to remaine in their lodgings and take their case: but the two souldiers Pedro Sarmiento, and Miguel de Loarcha should come and speake with him, and that they should bring with them their interpreter, for that hée had one there with him (who was a Chino, and vnderstood the language of the Philippinas, but so badly, that they coulde not by his interpretation talke of any matter of importance. So when they came thither, they were brought whereas hee was, but with lesse ceremony then on the first day: but yet they found him with the like maiestie as before. He asked of them how the fathers did, and they themselues, and if they were refreshed of the trauell in the iourney, and howe they did like of the countrie, and other thinges, which did demonstrate great aff

                     bilitie. Being by them satisfied of his demands, he requested them to declare vnto him the whole circumstance of the comming of Limahon the rouer, vnto the Ilands, and how the Spaniards dealt with him: that although hee had béene informed pa

                     eth. Hée was nothing deceiued in that hee suspected,) for after that our souldiers had made a true relation of the comming of the rouer vnto Manilla, and of all the rest as you haue heard in the discourse thereof in this booke, he found that they differed very much, the one from the other, for that they did attribute it wholly vnto themselues to get honour and benefite: but the Insuanto like a wise man straightwayes vnderstood their pretence. But when that he perceiued that Limahon was neither dead nor prisoner, but onely besieged, he offered vnto them that if they would returne againe vnto Pagansinan vpon him whereas he was, hée would giue vnto them fiue hundred ships of warre, with people suf

                     cient to serue both by sea and lande,He offered 500. shippes of warre, and more if they would request. They answered him, that all such cost and labour were but in vaine, for that the generall of the fielde who hath him in siege, with the people and ships that he hath, are sufficient to ende that enterprise, and to

send him hither aliue or deade, and that long before that their fleete should come thither. And besides this, their Ilands were poore of victuals, and could not sustaine so great an armie many dayes. Being satisfied with these reasons, hee gaue place that the interpreter which they brought should come in where as they were, for hee remained at the doore without, for that he would be fully certified to auoid the suspitious doubt he had before he come in presence, yet he did help them very much. So when their interpreter was come in, the Spaniards séeing good occasion and oportunitie for to declare that which passed the day before, betwixt them and the fathers, touching the speaking vnto him on their knées: and séeing as it seemed vnto thē that he was at that time in a good mind for to heare them,Note the spaniards 
                           •
                        nsolencie. they did vtter vnto him all the whole contention (after that they had declared many reasons of great consideration, to giue them to vnderstand that it was not conuenient to do it, but especially to religious men, who were there as principals ouer the rest, vnto whom the king of Spaine (their lord) himselfe doth stand on foote, when as they do intreat of any matter, although it be but of small importance: for that they are priests and ministers of God, whom he doth worship and reuerence.
                  The Insuanto with a merry countenance did answere them, that vnto that time he vnderstood no more of them, then in that he was informed by the captaine Omoncon, and did not acknowledge them to be any other but Castillas: without knowin

                     though hee not grant vnto any that preheminence, no not vnto a vizroy, except he were an ambassador sent from some king. With this resolution, and with many other good wordes they tooke their

leaue of him, and went ioyfull and content vnto their lodgings, wheras they sound the friers wearie with entertaining of such as did visite them, and with great desire to sée them, to knowe wherefore the Insuanto did send for them, with whome they had béene so long time. But after that that they vnderstoode the effect of the whole, and how that the gouernor did permit that they should talke with him after their owne fashion, they were maruellously glad thereof, and had a very good hope to conclude their pretence, wherefore they went, and praised God for the good successe of that which they pretended.
               
               
                  CHAP. XX. The gouernor doth banquet the Spaniards, and afterwards make all thinges in a redinesse for to go vnto Aucheo▪ whereas the vizroy tarieth their comming.
                  THe next day following, the gouernor called a Gentleman of his house vnto him, and commanded him to go and visite the Spaniards, and to informe himselfe of them if that that they lacked any thing, as well in their victuals as in their lodgings, and to know if they did require any thing particular to themselues to aduise him therof, and he would furnish them forthwith for the loue that hee bare vnto them, for their good contractation, and for the great seruice that they had done vnto the king, in the businesse of Limahon. And also that he should in his name inuite them for the next day folowing to dine with him in his house. This Gentleman went vnto them and accomplished his message: and the Spaniards answered, kissing his hande for the great care hée had of them: saying that they were furnished in all thinges aboundantly (as in trueth they were) and how they were maruellously well lodged, chéered, and lacked nothing: and that the great care hee had of them was agréeable vnto the hope they had of his good presence and gentlenesse: accepting the inuiting for the next day, the which was giuen them, and accomplished in this forme following.
                  The next day when they went vnto the pallace which was at dinner time, they were caried into a hall that was below in the second court, whereas were many chaires of veluet &amp; tables

that were painted with their frontals before: they had no table clothes on them, for that they doo not vse any in that countrie, as hath beene told you in the first part of this historie, neither is it néedfull for their maner of feeding. In the first chaires they caused the Friers to sit downe, euery one at a table by himselfe, and each of them other sixe tables, placed in order, compassing 
                        •
                     ounde like a circle: then were the Spanish souldiers set in the same manner, and each of them had fiue tables, and next vnto them the captaine of the guard b
                        •
                     longing vnto the gouernor, and two other Captaines: and euerie one of them had three tables. For that it is the custome of that countrie to make a difference in the qualitie of the guestes, by the n
                        •
                     mber of the tables. All these were placed in circle or compasse (as aforesaide) that they might see one another. In the midest betwixt them there was a round compasse, wheras was represented a comedie with much pastime, and indured all the dinnner time, and a good while after. There was also great store of verie good and excellent musicke, accompanied with gallant voyces, also iesters, with puppets and other thinges of great pastime, to driue the time away.
                  On the first table was set to euery one of the guestes, little baskets wrought with golde and siluer wyre, full of swéete meates made of sugar, as Marchpanes, Castels, Pitchers, Pots, Dishes, Dogges, Bulles, Elephants, and other things verie curious, and all guilt: besides this there were many dishes full of flesh, as Capons, Hennes, Géese, Teales, gamons of Bacon, peeces of Béefe, and other sortes of flesh wherewith all the tables were replenished, sauing that whereat they did sit to dine, which was replenished with victuals that was dressed (for all the other was rawe) and was of so great aboundance, that there was at times more then fiftie dishes, and they were serued with great curiositie. They had wine of diuers sortes, and of that which they doo make in that countrie of the Palme trée, but of so great excellencie, that they founde no lacke of that which was made of Grapes. The dinner endured foure houres, and according vnto the aboundance and diuersitie they had in victuals, it might haue indured eight houres, for it was in so good order that it might haue béene giuen vnto any prince in the world.
                  
                     Their seruants and slaues that they brought with them at the same time, did dine in another hal nigh vnto the same, with so great abundance as their masters. When dinner was done, the gouernor commanded the people to come vnto him, with whom he did talke and comon with great friendship, and good conuersation, and would not consent that they shoulde kneele downe, neither to bee bare headed. So after that hee had made vnto them tokens of friendshippe, and deteined them a while, in demaunding of many thinges, lastly he told them that there was an order come from the vizroy of Aucheo, that they shuld go thither with great spéede, so that it did require that they shoulde depart the next day following, for the which they were verie glad and ioyfull, for that they had great desire the one to sée the other: and againe with him they might treate and comon tguching their comming into that countrie, and for what intent: and for all other things néedfull, for that he was a man fit for their purpose, and one welbeloued of the king. So hee tooke his leaue of vs with great friendship and curtesie: who did surrender the same after our custome, putting of our cappes, and making reuerence, for the which hee made shewe that it greatly contented him.
                  At their going foorth out of the hall, they found the captaine that did dine with them, and with him many other Gentlemen that tarried their comming for to beare them company vnto their lodging: going before them many seruants, that did carie the raw meate, that was vpon the other tables ouer and aboue that which they did eate on, the which was done for great maie
                        •
                     tie, and a ceremony verie much vsed in that kingdom, so many times as they do make any banquet.
                  So when they came vnto their lodging they founde that the Insuanto had sent them a very good present, in the which was for euery one of them foure péeces of silke, and counting chestes with other thinges, and certaine painted mantels for the seruants and slaues. So after they had taken their leaue of the captaines and Gentlemen that did beare them companie home, they beganne with great ioy to put all thinges in order for their iourney the next day following.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XXI. The Spaniards departe from the Cittie of Chincheo, and commeth to that of Aucheo, whereas the vizroy did tarrie their comming.
                  THe next day in the morning before that the Spaniards were stirring, there was within the house all thinges necessary for their iourney, as well of litter chaires, as of horses and men for to carrie them, and their stuffe, the which they did with so good a will (as aforesaid) that they did fall out and striue amongst themselues, who should be the first that should receiue their burthen. So all things being in good order, they departed, hauing in their companie the same captaine and souldiers, that vnto that time had béene their guard, vntil they came vnto the cittie of Aucheo, whereas the vizroy was. This iourney was vnto them ioyfull, as well for to entreate of matters touching their comming, and to be resolued what they shuld do, as also to depart out of Chincheo, whereas they passed much trouble, by reason of the great number of people that came for to sée them, who neuer would be satisfied: and yt was in such extremity, that some dayes at tenne of the clocke in the night, the stréete round about their lodging were full of people, and onely to sée them, which caused great trouble and heate with their rumor &amp; presse amongst them. This day by reason they vnderstood that they should depart, the prease and multitude of the people was so great, that although they had tip staues before them, to beate the people away and to make roome, yet was it almost night before they could get out of the citie: so that they were constrained to remaine in a towne there hard by all that night, where as by the commandement of the gouernour they were verie well lodged, and their supper made readie in verie good order, as it was in seauen dayes together, till such time as they came vnto Aucheo without taking for the same or for anie other thing necessarie for their sustentation, anie price or value. There went continuallie before them a Post with a prouision from the gouernour, written in a great borde wherein was declared who they were, and from whence they came, and commanding that there should bee prouided for

them all things necessarie in abundance, vppon the kings cost, which was the occasion that so much people came for to sée them, that in the high waies they were many times disturbed: so with great trouble, the thirde day they came vnto a citie which was called Megoa, which was sometimes the head gouernement, the which was offortie thousand housholds, but a great part thereof was dispeopled: the occasion thereof they tolde vs, (and was) that about thirtie yeares past, the Iapones, who brought for their guides thrée Chinos, who doo nowe dwell in Manilla, and are become Christians, and came vpon that cittie, (to reuenge themselues of an iniurie that was done vnto them) the which they put in execution with so great secrecie and policie, that they made themselues lords of the citie without any daunger or hurt vnto themselues: for that fiftie Iapones, men fit for that purpose, did apparell themselues in Chinos apparell without being knowne, and came vnto a gate of the Cittie, whereas the souldiers that had the charge thereof were voide of all suspition of any enimies that woulde come, which was the occasion that their armor and weapon was not all in a redinesse. And within a little while after that, followed two thousand that did disembarke themselues in a secreat and vnknowne place, and came in verie secret order, because they would not be discouered, and did beset that gate of the cittie, whereas their companions were, which they sent before: who so soone as they saw them nigh at hande, drewe out their weapons the which they caried hid vnder their apparell, and set vpon the souldiers (that were voide of feare and vnarmed) with so great furie and force, that they being amased were easilie slaine, so that they were lordes of the gate, whereas they left verie good guard, and followed their victorie, and made themselues lordes of the Cittie, without any daunger vnto their persons, and did possesse the same certaine dayes, and did sacke the same in spite of them all, with great harme and losse vnto the inhabitants thereof, vntill such time as the vizroy of Aucheo did l
                        •
                     uie an armie togither of thrée score and tenne thousande men, and went vpon them with courage for to bée reuenged on the iniurie receiued, with the death of all the Iapones: but they séeing that they coulde not defend themselues against so manie, in one night they left the Cittie and

went vnto their shippes, whereas they had left them in verie good order, and carried with them the spoile of the Cittie, leauing it beaten downe and dispopulared the greater part thereof: in which sort the Spaniards founde it, and the iniurie receiued so fresh in their minds as though it had béene doone the day before.
                  In this Citie they were lodged in the kings house, the which was of verie great &amp; faire buildings: there was giuen them to dine and suppe in very good order, and with aboundance. So soone as they came thither, the Friers remained in their lodgings, but Pedro Sarmiento and Miguel de Loarcha went to visite the gouernor, vsing the spanish curtesie with him: and he receiued them with great ioy and curtesie. After they had taken their leaue and returned vnto their lodgings, the gouernor sent to visite them El Tyu, who is the auncientest of his counsaile, who was with them a good while verie friendly, and offered his seruice in all thinges that were néedfull, and so departed to his house maruellously well accompanied.
                  The gouernor sent vnto the two souldiers that went to visite him, e
                        •
                     h of them two péeces of silke.
                  At their departure from this Cittie, trauelling towards Aucheo, they passed ouer a mightie great ryuer, by a bridge all made of stone: the goodliest and greatest that euer they had séene, whose greatnesse did cause wonderful admiration, so that they stayed and did measure it from one end to another, that it might be put amongst the wonders of that country, which they tooke a note of. They found that it was one thousand and thrée hundred foote long, and that the least stone wherewith it was built, was ofseuentéene foote, and many of two and twentie foote long, and eight foote broad, and séemed vnto them a thing impossible to be brought thither by mans art, for that all round about so farre as they could sée, was plaine ground without any mountaines: by which they iudged them to be brought from farre. When they were passed that bridge, they trauelled al the rest of the day till night vpon a causie that was very broad and plaine, and on both sides many victualling houses, and the fieldes sowed with Rice, wheate, and other séeds: and so full of people as in the stréetes of a good towne or cittie.
                  So when they came into the suburbes of the citie of Aucheo,
                     
they founde order and commandement from the vizroy, what should be done, as more at large shalbe declared vnto you in the chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXII. The entrie of the Spaniards into the Cittie of Aucheo, and how the vizroy did entertaine and receiue them.
                  AFter they had trauelled more then halfe a league in the suburbs of the cittie of Aucheo, they met with a post that came from the vizroy: who brought order that they should reremaine in a house that was appointed for them in the said suburbs, and there to be lodged for that night, for that it was late, &amp; they could not come vnto the house appointed in the cittie for them, or else peraduenture to giue content vnto many that had great desire to sée those strangers, for that they must passe thorough the Cittie, and better to bee séene in the day then in the night. So soone as they were alighted, there came a gentleman to visite them, sent from the vizroy to bidde them welcome, and to know howe they did with their iourney, and also to sée that they were well prouided for that night of all things necessarie, and that in aboundance. After all the which being done, he told them that the viceroy did verie much reioyce of their comming, and for that it was late, and the Citie farre off, it was his pleasure that they shoulde bee lodged that night in the suburbes vntill the next day, then will he giue order, that they may enter into the Cittie with the authoritie conuenient vnto their persons. After this Gentleman came other Captaines to visite them, and brought with them great store of conserues, wine, and fruit: which is a common custome amongst them, when that they go in the like visitation, and it is carried by their seruants in little baskets very curiously wrought, or else in barrels made of earth all guilt. Within two houres after their comming thither, there came another messenger from the vizroy with many men laden with Capons, Hens, Géese, Teales, gamons of Bacon and conserues of diuers sorts, and of great abundance, sufficient for one hundreth men to sup that night, and for their dinner the next day.
                  The next day in the morning very early, there came much

people vnto their lodging, sent by the vizroy, and brought with them two rich Chaires for to carrie the fathers in, and the curtines tied vp, that they might the better be seene, and for their companions verie good horses, sadled after the fashion which they doo vse. They forthwith made haste for to depart, and although they made great spéed, yet were they a good houre and a halfe before they coulde come vnto the gates of the Cittie, and séemed vnto them that they had trauelled two leagues in the suburbes: the which was so well peopled, so faire houses, and many shoppes full of merchandise, that if it had not beene told them, they would not haue beléeued it to be the suburbes, but the cittie it selfe.
                  Before they came vnto the gates, they passed a mightie riuer thrée times ouer bridges that were great and verie faire, and the riuer so déepe, that great shippes came vp the same, but their mastes stooping downe, to passe vnder the bridges. This Cittie is the richest and the best prouided that is in all the kingdome: it is the heade Cittie of all the Prouince, verie rich and fertill, and manie townes belonging vnto it, and but eight leagues from the sea, and hath mightie riuers, wherein great shippes come vp to it as aforesaide. At the enterie of the Citie, they founde many Gentlemen that were there at the gate tarrying their comming: who after they had saluted the one the other after their fashions, without anie staying they trauelled forwardes on, thorough a great and broad stréet that went directlie vnto the vizroy his pallace: vpon both sides of the stréete, from the gate forwards was placed one by another full of souldiers with their officers and ancient, euerie one with his weapon in his hands, as pickes, hargabuses, swords and target, all apparelled in one liuerie of silke, and a bunch of fethers vppon their crestes. They all stoode still and kept their places, and would not consent that any should crosse the way in the streete, whereas they went accompanied with the Gentlemen.
                  They had no leasure to tell the souldiers, but they sawe that from the gate vntil they came vnto the vizroyes pallace on both sides, which was a good way to beefull of them, and all richly apparelled and of one colour. The people that were at the windowes &amp; in the stréete, betwixt the houses &amp; the soldiers

were so great a number that it séemed to bee doomes day, and that all the people in the worlde were there ioyned together in that streete.
                  So when they came vnto the pallace which was two houres after day, the Gentlemen that were their guides did cause the Spaniardes to enter into a roome which was hard by, till such time as the gate was open, for that it is open but once a day, &amp; so continue no longer time then the audience endureth, which is done by the Uiceroy once euerie day, and that is but a small time. But first before he doth enter into audience, there is shot off foure péeces of artilerie, with a great noyse of trompettes drommes and waites. And there is no day that passeth without audience, as our people did sée by experience so long as they were there, and were likewise informed of others. The houre being come, and the ceremony doone as aforesaide, the gates were opened, and there was in the court many souldiers, apparelled in the same liuerie that those were of in the stréete. From the middest amongst them came forth a gentleman who was as it was told them, the Captaine of the garde of the viceroy, who came with great grauitie and authoritie towards the place whereas our people were, and after they had saluted the one the other, he made signes vnto them that they should go towardes the gates of the pallace. When they were within the first court, the which was great and wrought with mightie pillers, there was a great number of souldiers, &amp; many sergeants that entred into an other great court, and mounted vp a paire of stayres that was on the one side, whereas all the people were with great silence, sauing the captaine of the garde, who went with our people till they came to the gates of the hall, whereas was the viceroy, at which gate he staied with his head discouered, and made signes vnto ours that they should doo the like, and to tarrie there till such time as hee had aduised the viceroy of their comming, and he to command them to enter.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXIII. The Spaniardes haue audience of the Viceroy of Aucheo, and are visited of some of the principall officers, who declare vnto them certaine thinges of that citie.
                  
                     THen straightwayes came foorth of the hall a man apparelled in a long robe, of good personage, and asked of the Spaniards if they would speake with the viceroy, &amp; they answered, yea: then asked he again from whō they came &amp; by whom they were sent, they answered, yt they were sent by the gouernor of Philippinas, who was seruant vnto the mightiest king in all Christendome. When he had this answere he returned againe into the hall, and within a little while after he came forth, &amp; bad thē come in, but gaue them to vnderstand, that in entring into the hall wheras the viceroy was, yt they should kneele downe, &amp; talke with him in that order till he commanded to the contrarie, if they would vse this ceremony, that then they should come in, if not that they shold returne back againe. They who were certified thereof by the gouernor of Chincheo did not stand therein, but saide yt they would obserue 
                        •
                     he order giuen vnto them. Therewith he went in, who séemed to be the master of ceremonies, making a signe that they should follow after him, and doo that which he willed them to do.
                  At the entring in at the doore they stayed a little, and then knéeled downe right oueragainst there whereas the Uiceroye sate in a chaire verie high like vnto a throne, with a table before him, and was in so darke a place that almost they coulde not see his face verie well. On the one side of him there were some like vnto Heraldes of armes, with sc
                        •
                     pters in their handes, and on the other side two men of a gallant comlinesse armed with Corselets made of skales of golde downe to the cafe of their legges, with bowes in their handes of golde, and quiuers at their backes of the same. Both the one and the other were vpon their knées. There was vpon the table before him, paper and all thinges necessarie to write: which is an ordinarie vse amongest them at all times, when there is anye publike audience, and on the one side of the borde a Lion made of blacke woode, which was (as after they vnderstoode) the armes of that prouince. So straightwayes hee made signes vnto them to drawe neare, which they did, and knéeled downe a little from the table which was whereas the master of ceremonies did will them. In this sort they beganne to talke with him by their interpreter, and tolde them the occasion of their comming into that Citie and kingdome, and from whom

and vnto whome they were sent. But hee made signes vnto them that they should arise, the which they did with a verye good will▪ and did perseuer in their intent. But the Uiceroye did cut them off before they coulde make an ende, and asked if they had brought any letter from their king, vnto the king his Lorde, whome they would goe to sée and talke with: but when they answered no, hee straightwayes tooke his leaue of them, saying that th
                        •
                     y were welcome, and that they should depart vnto their lodginges and to take their ease, for that afterwardes they should haue occasion to declare their mindes vnto him, and hee would giue them their answere, for that the king was farre of, and it requireth a long time to come whereas he is, but he would write vnto him, and according vnto his commandement he would make them answere. And therwith he tooke the letter, and the memoriall of the present, and commanded in his presence, to put about the neckes of the Friers in manner of a scarfe to eyther of them sixe péeces of silke, and vnto the souldiers their companions, and vnto Omoncon and Sinsay each of them foure péeces, and to euerye one of their seruantes two a péece, and to giue vnto the two Fryers and the souldiers, Omoncon and Sinsay, euerie one of them two branches of siluer, which is a thing vsed in that countrie, vnto them that haue doone some woorthie déede, as hath béene tolde you before.
                  So with the silke about their neckes and with the branches in their hands, they returned out of the hall &amp; downe the staires the way they came, and so through the court into the stréetes▪ from whence they sawe them shut the court gate with so great a noyse as when they did open it. From thence at the request of Omoncon &amp; Sinsay they went vnto the house of Totoc who is the Captaine generall of all the men of warre &amp; vnto the house of Cagnito
                           •
                        
                      who is ye chiefe standerd bearer: their houses were nigh the one the other, very faire &amp; great. They found thē with as great maiestie as the viceroy, and in the same order, with a table before them, &amp; had on ech side of thē armed souldiers, knéeling on their knées. Yet did they not vse our men with the curtesie that the viceroy vsed, to cause them to stand vp, which was the occasion, that straightwayes they made a showe that they would depart and be gone, complayning of Omoncon &amp; Sinsay
                     
for that they did carrie them thether, and tolde them with anger that the gouernour of Manilla did intreate them in a different sort, who was there resident for the mightiest prince in all the worlde, and they but easie marchants, neither was their going thether to be equalled, vnto the benefite that they cam
                        •
                      thether for. This discontent the which they receiued was the occasion that they would n
                        •
                     t go to make any more visitations, although the sayde Omoncon and Sinsay for their owne interest, would haue carried them to the houses of other officers and gentlemen of the court. But they made signes vnto those that were their guides, to direct their way vnto their lodgings for that they would goe to eate somewhat, and to take their ease, the which was ordayned in a great house of the kinges, there whereas ordinarily the Iudges doo sit to heare matters of Iustice.
                  So at their comming thether they founde all their stuffe in good order, and their dinner marueilous well prouided, and the whole house hanged and trimmed as though it had béene for the kings owne person, with many wayting men and souldiers those which did gard them both day and night, and hanging at the doore two tables or bordes (commanded by the viceroy) wheron was written who they were, that were there lodged, and from whence they came, and wherefore, and that none whosoeuer, should be so hardie as to offer them any wrong or disturbance, vpon paine to be for the same offence seuerely punished. In this house they were more in quiet, than in anie other place whereas they had béen,A citie of three hundred thousand housholds. neyther did the people giue them so much trouble, by reason of the great care which the Iudges had in putting order for the same, by the commandemēt of the viceroy, yet was it the greatest towne and most populed of all that prouince (although in other prouinces there be that be much bigger) and is affirmed that the Citie of Taybin or Suntiem (there whereas the king and his court is resident) hath thrée hundreth thousande housholds,
                        A city bigger thē the other, and requireth three daies to go from one gate to an other.
                        Seuentie leagues compasse.
                      and yet there is a bigger Citie in the kingdome called, Lanchin, which requireth thrée dayes to go from one gate to an other, and is in compasse more then seuentie leagues, the which is not far distant from Canton, that which the Portingalles hath great notice of. But of certaine there is very much spoken of the mightinesse of this

Citie, and I my selfe haue heard reported and affirmed to bee of a trueth, by men of authoritie that haue béene in the Citie of Canton, religious Fryers of the order of Iesus or Iesuites to whom ought to be giuen credite.
                  This Citie of Aucheo hath a verie faire and strong wall made of stone which is fiue fadam high, and foure fadam brode,The wall of the Citie is fiue fadam high &amp; four
                           •
                         broad. the which was measured many times by our people, for that they had a gate out of their lodging that did open to the same. This wall is all couered ouer with tiles to defende the rayne water for hurting of it, which could not to the contrarie but receiue damage, for that there is no lyme vsed in the whole wall. They haue not one castle in all this Citie, neyther is there any vsed in all that kingdome, for all their force and strength is in their gates the which be made very strong, with a double wall within verie broade, betwixt the which are continually many souldiers such as do keepe watch and ward both day and night.
                  Upon these gates they haue much ordinance, but verie ill wrought (I meane such as were séene by our men) yet they do say that in other places they haue excellent good and verie curiously wrought. The whole wall is full of bartilmentes, and theron written the names of such souldiers as are bound to repayre thether in the time of necessitie. At euerie hundreth paces they haue lodginges the which are very huge and great: there whereas in the time of necessitie doo remaine and dwell their Captaynes, so long as their troubles doo indure, all the wall is fortified with two great mots or ditches the one within and the other without,The citie double mooted. the which they doo fill at all times when they please, by sluces which they haue from the riuer for the same purpose, and doo serue of water almost all the houses in the Citie, whereas they haue their stanges for the most part full of fish This mightie Citie is situated in a great plaine and compassed round about with mightie rockes and mountaines, which is the occasion that it is not so healthfull, and the inhabitants saye, that it is by reason of the mountaines, and many times it is ouerflowen in the winter by spring tides frō the riuer. And in that yeare that this doth happen it doth destroy and ruinate a great part of the city, as it was at that time when our people did sée it, for yt in the winter before they were troubled with these great tides, which did them much harme.
                  
                     Now to returne to our purpose, you shall vnderstand that in the kinges house aforesaide, our people remained all the time that they were in this Citie, wheras they were made much of, and visited by the principall of the same, but in especiall of the viceroy, who the verie same day di
                        •
                      send to inuite them for the next day following, who made vnto them a famous banket, as you shall vnderstand in this chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXIIII. The viceroy doth banket our people in his owne house two daies one after the other.
                  THe next day after that our people came into the Citie, the Uiceroy did sende to inuite them to dinner to his owne house, whereas he made them a great banket in the forme following. At their comming vnto the pallace there came foorth a great number of Gentlemen, seruantes vnto the viceroy, to bid them welcome, with great store of musicke and tokens of mirth. Being entred into the first court, they brought them into a mightie hall that was marueilously well trimmed, wherein was a great number of tables set in such order as they were in the banket that was made them by the gouernour of Chincheo, (as hath beene tolde you) although in the number and furniture did far excell the other. But before they did sit down, there came vnto them two captaines principall men, vnto whō the viceroy had committed the charge of the banket, to doo all things in his name, for that it is a custome in that kingdome, that noble mē must not be present in their bankets they make. So the charge was giuen vnto them, to make thē be mery, and to bid his guests welcome. When they came vnto them they vsed great curtesie, and passed away the time in gall
                        •
                     nt discourses, till it was time to go to dinner, &amp; that they began to bring in their victuals.A strange 
                           •
                        eremonie. Then before they did sit downe, the captaines did take ech of them a cup in his hande, in maner of a Sorlue as they do vse, and being full of wine, they went together whereas they might discouer the heauē and offered it vnto the sunne, and vnto the saints of heauen, adding thereunto many words of prayers: but principally they did request that the comming of their newe guestes might be profitable vnto them all, and

that the friendship which they did pretende to establish, might be for good both vnto the one and to the other. This their oration and prayer being done they did spill out the wine making a great courtesie, then were they straightwayes filled againe, and making reuerence vnto their guestes euerie one by himselfe, they set the cuppes downe vpon the tables whereas the fathers should dine whereas they were set euerie one by himselfe. This being doone, the first seruice was set vppon the bordes, and the Captaines were set at other tables, which were not so many in number, nor so well furnished nor dressed as the other: the dinner was famous and of manie diuersities of meates, excéeding verie much that which was made them by the Gouernor of Aucheo.
                  
                  The time which the banket indured (which was verie late) there was great store of musicke of diuers instrumentes, as of vials, gitterns, and rebuckes, and with them many iesters did make them mer
                        •
                     y at their dinner. The which being done, the saide Captaines did beare their guests companie out of the pallace, whereas they did anew inuite them to dinner for the next day in the same h
                        •
                     ll: they obeying their request did come, wheras was made vnto them a banket more famous than the first.
                  This day at the banket was present the Totoc, hee whome they visited the first day, came in his owne house, and founde with so great maiestie. Likewise there dyned with them the Captaynes that were at the first banket.Comedies vsed amongest them. In this seconde banket they had as the day before, verie much musicke, and a Comedie that indured long, with manie pretie and merrie iestes: there was also a tombler,Tomblers. who did his feates verie artificially, as well in vauting in the ayre, as vppon a staffe that two men did hold on their shoulders. Before the comedie did beginne, was tolde them by their interpreter the signific
                        •
                     
                     tion thereof, that the better they might content themselues in the conceiuing, whose argument was, that in times past,The argument of the
                           ••
                         comedie. there was in that countrie manie mightie and valiant men. But amongest them all, there was in particular thrée brethren that did excéede all the rest that euer were in mightinesse and valiantnesse. The one of them was a white man, the other was ruddish or hie coloured and 
                        〈◊〉
                      third blacke. The ruddish being more ingenious, and of better industrie, did procure

                     
                        •
                     o make his white brother king, the which iudgement was agréeable vnto the rest. Then they altogether did take away the kingdome from him that did at that time raigne, who was called Laupicono, an effeminate man and verie vicious. This they did represent verie gallantly with garmentes verie méete for those personages.
                  The banket and play beeing finished, according as they did the day before, the Captaynes did beare them companie till they were out of the pallace, and from thence they went vnto their lodgings, with their ordinarie companie appointed by the viceroy, which was that Captaine that we haue spoken of, with his souldiers, who neither night nor day dooth not depart from their garde.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXV. The Spaniards do carie their present vnto the viceroy, who hauing receiued it by the hands of Omoncon doth seale it and sende it vnto the king: our men bee forbidden to goe foorth of their houses to see any thing in the Citie: and it doth intreat of other particular things.
                  THe same night our men did common amongst themselues, to sée if it were good presently to giue order to put in vre the thing they came for: séeing that they might treat therof with the Uiceroy, he being a man that shewed vnto them so much fauour and good will. So in conclusion they were all resolued that straightwayes the next daye in the morning, shoulde goe vnto him Michaell de Loarcha, and Peter Sarmiento, and carrie vnto him the present which they brought, and to haue with them to beare them company Omoncon and Sinsay, and being presented, to request that hee would appoint a day when they might goe and talke with him about principall matters.
                  This accorde they put in execution according vnto their determination, and the two souldiers went and carried the present as it was agreed. So they came vnto the pallace, and hauing tarried till such time as they opened the gates of the audience, (which was with the ceremony spoken of in the 22. chapter) it was tolde vnto the viceroy that the Castillos were there

and had brought a present, who incontinent saide that as then he 
                        •
                     ould not talke with them: but that the captaine Omoncon &amp; Sinsay should enter in with the present, and that they should returne vnto their lodginges, for that he had a care to call them when that oportunitie did serue to intreat of all things to their pleasure. They did as they were 
                        •
                     ommaunded, and those who carried the present in, did afterwarde giue our people to vnderstand all that had passed with them, saying that in opening the present, there was a note thereof taken before a notarie, and straightwayes commanded to bee put in againe where it was taken out before the sayde notarie &amp; other witnesses, the which being done he sealed it vp, and sent it vnto the Citie of Taybin vnto the king and his counsell, and therewith that which the Gouernour of Chincheo did sende him, as shall be tolde you: for that they haue a rigorous lawe in that kingdome, that dooth prohibite all such as haue any office of gouernement, to receiue any present of what qualitie so euer it be, without lycence of the king or of his counsell, vpon paine to be depriued of bearing anie office all the dayes of their liues, and to bee banished and condemned to weare red bonnets (as wee haue declared the effect thereof.)
                  This is conformable vnto that which the gouernor of Chincheo did, in the presence of our people, at such time as they went to take their leaue of him, for to goe vnto Aucheo, which was, that in their presence they commanded to take foorth all that they brought him in present, and shewing it vnto them péece by peece. He asked if it were that which they had brought, and they aunswered that it was the same (although it was with troubled mindes) beléeuing that it was to checke them because it was so small in respect of their mightinesse: he asked them if there lacked any thing, they answered no, then straightwayes he commanded to put it againe whereas it was taken out in their presence, and before a notarie and witnesses: the which being doone, was mailed and sealed and so sent vnto the viceroy of Aucheo in their companie, and saide that hee could not receiue it without the licence aforesaid.
                  So our souldiers séeing that they could not be suffered to enter in with the present, they tooke it for a great discourtesie and disfauour, and therewith departed vnto their lodging, to

giue the fathers to vnderstande thereof, who liked not well thereof, but yet they concluded amongest themselues to suffer for a while, and to commit vnto God the direction thereof, as it best may be for his holy seruice.
                  The next day following, the viceroy did send to visite them, and to aske of them a sword, a hargubush and a 
                        •
                     laske: for that he would cause others to be made by them, the which they did send, and afterwardes vnderstood, that they had counterfeited the same although not in so perfect manner.
                  Then after a time our people seeing, that their beeing in that citie séemed to be long and like to be longer, they did procure to driue away the time in the best manner they could, and went abroad into the citie and did by eyther of them that which they thought best.All things good cheape. Whereof they found great abundance, and of so small price, that they bought it almost for nothing.
                  They bought many bookes that did intreat of diuerse matters, which they brought with them to the Ilands (as appeareth more at large in the chapter for the same.)
                  The next day they went to sée the gates of the Citie, and all such curious thinges as were to be séene so farre as they could learne or vnderstande, which were many. But amongst them all they sawe a sumptuous temple of their Idolles,111. Idols in one chappell. in whose chiefe chappell they counted one hundred and eleuen Idols, besides a great number more that were in other particular chappels, all were of carued worke, verie well proportioned and gilted: but in especiall thrée of them that were placed in the middest of all the rest, the one had thrée heads procéeding out of one bodie, the one looking on the other in full face. The second was the forme of a woman with a childe in her armes, the third of a man apparelled after the forme and fashion that the Christians doo paint the Apostles. Of all the rest some had foure armes, and some had sixe, and other eight, and other some marueilous deformed monsters. Before them they had burning lamps, and many swéete parfumes and smelles, but in especiall before the thrée aboue specified.
                  But when that the viceroy did vnderstande that our people did go viewing the Citie gates and temples (and perceiueth that they that gaue him the notice did suspect it that it was to some ill intent) therewith he straightwayes commanded

that they should not goe 
                        •

                     is licence: and likewise commanded the Captaine that was their garde not to consent thereunto as he had done, and likewise that none should carrie them any thing for to sell, for he that did it should be punished with whipping. Yet notwithstanding, they had euerie day verie sufficient necessaries for their personages in such ample wise, that there did alwayes remaine, and not lacke.
                  In this closenesse and kéeping in, they suffered many dayes with much sadnesse, and oppressed with melancholick humors, to sée that their purpose wherefore they went thether séemed to be long, and euerie day was worse &amp; worse. Yet no
                        •
                     withstanding they did passe it ouer in the best wise they could, in cōmitting it with heartie zeale vnto God, for whose honor and glorie they did attempt that voyage, &amp; prayed vnto him for to mooue their hearts to consent that the religious fathers might remaine in that countrie, for to learne the language (as they had begun many daies before) by which meanes their soules might be saued, and clearely deliuered from the tyrannie of the diuell, who of truth had them in possession. So after many dayes that they had remained in that close estate as aforesaide, they determined for to goe and talke with the viceroy, and to bee fully resolued either to tarry or returne from whence they came. They straightwayes did put it in vre, and what ensued thereof you shall vnderstande in the chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXVI. The Spaniardes talke with the Viceroy, and not being suffered, they do write to him a letter, and he doth answere it by word of mouth, with other particular matters.
                  IT hath béen declared vnto you, that the same day yt the Spaniardes did talke with the viceroy, he asked them if they had brought any letter for their king, they answered no: he tolde them that he would write vnto the court, and hauing answere, they should be fully satisfied of their pretence and demaund.
                  But they séeing that his aunswere was long a comming and great delaye made therein, and that they had them as halfe prisoners, they determined to go and speake with the

viceroy, to be fully satisfied of his determinate will &amp; pretence, and to haue some order eyther to goe vnto the court, or to remaine in that citie, or else to returne vnto the Ilands, and there to tarrie the time till it pleased God to open a gate in that kingdome, wherein might enter his holy gospell.
                  With this their pretended purpose, they did perswade with their captaine to permit them so much libertie as for to go and speake with the viceroy, who for that hee bare them loue and good will did consent therevnto. So they went, but when they came thether they that kept the gates would not consent yt they should enter, which was the occasion that they returned vnto their lodgings verie sad and sorrowfull, and almost without any hope to bring their matter to passe, for the which they went thether, for that it séemed vnto them although they did plainely declare vnto them their pretence, yet did they worke in such order for to cause them to depart. In this order they remained in the citie certaine daies, and for to conclude either to stay there or depart the kingdome, they were resolute, and determined to write a letter vnto the viceroy, and therein to giue him to vnderstand particularly, that their comming thether into ye countrie was to intreat that betwixt thē &amp; the Castillos there should be peace &amp; friendship, and being concluded that their souldiers should with that newes, depart vnto the Ilandes from whence they came, to giue the gouernor to vnderstand therof, &amp; they to remaine in that countrie preaching ye holy gospell. They could finde none that would write this letter for them, although they would haue payed them very well for their paines. Till in the end, by great request and prayings the captaine Omoncon did write it for them▪ and straightwaies departed vnto the citie of Ampin that was not farre off, making an excuse for to go &amp; sée the visitor of the prouince whom they doo call Sadin: he would very faine haue carried with him two of our people, yt he might haue séene them, but none would go with him. This iourney which Omoncon made, hee did it to put away the suspition they might conceiue, that he did write the letter, if that peraduenture the viceroy would take it in ill part.

                     ne that would carie it, neyther would they consent that our men should enter into the

pallace to deliuer it. But in conclusion, what with requestes and giftes they perswaded their Captayne of their gard to carrie it, who did deliuer the same vnto the viceroye, in name of the Castillos, saying that hee tooke it of them to bring it vnto him, for that they did certifie him, that it was a thing that did import verie much. Hauing read the letter, hee answered that he would giue the king to vnderstande thereof, as he saide at the first time. And in that touching the Fryers remayning in that countrie to preach, at that time hee could make them no answere, for that in such matters it was first requisite to haue the good will of the Royall Counsell▪ Yet would hee make answere vnto the letter they brought from the Gouernour of Manilla, and that they might depart, and returne againe at such time as they brought Limahon, prisoner or dead, the which being done, then shall the friendshippe be concluded which they doo pretende, and to remaine and preach at their will. With this answere they remained without all hope to remayne there, and did incontinent prepare themselues for to depart from Manilla, and bought manie bookes to carie with them, wherein was comprehended all the secrets of that kingdome. By reason whereof they might giue large notice vnto the royall maiestie of king Phillip. The which being vnderstoode by the Uiceroy, who had set spies to watch their doings, did sende them worde that they should not trouble themselues in the buying of bookes, for that hee would giue them fréely all such bookes as they would desire to haue: the which afterwardes he did not accomplish: whether it was for forgetfulnesse or other occasion, as wee haue more at large declared vnto you, we know not: yet did the Uiceroy send and demanded to sée some of those bookes that the Fryers had bought, who after that he had séene them, did returne them again, and requested of them some writing of their owne handes, who did accō
                     plish his request, and sent them written in spanish and in their owne language, the Lords prayer, the aue maria, and the ten commandements, who according vnto the relation of him that did carrie the same, saide, that after hee had reade it, he made showes that he receiued great content therewith, and said that all which was there written was good.
                  In the time that they stayed in this Citie, amongst all other

things that they vnderstoode, to driue away the time was one, it was giuen them to vnderstande that in one of the prisons, there was a Portingale prisoner, who was taken in a shippe of the Iapones with others of his nation, who were all dead in the prison, and none left aliue but he alone. Our people being verie desirous for to see him, and to learne of him some secrets of that countrie, for that he had béene there a great while, they did procure to talke with him, asking licence of the supreme Iudge and lieutenant vnto the viceroy, who did not onely refuse to grant it them, but did make diligent inquirie who they were that did giue them to vnderstande thereof, for to punish them, which without all doubt, should be executed with sharpe and seuere punishment. Yet our people would neuer tell them of whom they had it, although it was demanded of them diuerse times, and with great intreatie. They had so great desire to know it, that they did vse all meanes possible as it appeared in the boldnesse of their demandes.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXVII. There came newes vnto Aucheo that there was a rouer vpon the coast of Chincheo, which did much harme, and had sacked a towne. The viceroy doth suspect him to be Limahon, and how that our people with Omoncon and Sinsay, had not declared vnto him the truth.
                  THe Spaniards remained in the Citie of Aucheo twentie days, in the order as hath béen told you, without any hope, that the religious fathers should remaine in that countrie for to preach the holy gospell, which was the principall occasion of their going into that kingdome. Upon a suddaine there came newes vnto the citie that the rouer Limahon was vpon the coast of Chincheo vsing his olde accustomed cruelties, and how that he had spoiled and robbed a towne vpon the sea coast. This newes was throughout all the citie, and appeared to be true, touching the effect of the dead: yet false touching the person, for that the rouer was called Taocay an enimie and contrarie vnto Limahon: but a friend vnto Vintoquian, of whom we haue spoken of. But thereupon the viceroy and all them of the citie were conformable in the suspition that they had receiued,

which was that our people,Suspition of euill. were come into that kingdome vpon some euill pretence, and to sée the secrets thereof, to some euil end, which was the occasion yt frō that time forwards they shewed them not so good countenance as they did before.
                  These newes was not so soone come, but straightwayes the viceroy did sende for Omoncon (who was then returned from his visiting) and Sinsay vnto whom he had done courtesie, and giuen them the title of Loytias and captaynes, and he did reprehende them verie sharpely for that they had brought ouer people thether, and sayde that they had tolde him a lye, in saying that Limahon was besieged, in such sort that hee coulde not escape, neither had the Castillos burnt his shippes, and howe that all was but a made matter amongest themselues, and howe that the Captaines which they brought, and sayde that they had taken from Limahon, they had robbed from other places, with other wordes in the same order, and said that the Spaniardes were spyes that came to discouer the secretes and strength of the kingdome, and how that they had brought them thether by force of giftes that they had giuen them.
                  They answered him with great humilitie in saying that in all that which they had sayd they did speake the trueth, &amp; that it should appeare at such time as the newes of the rouer should be better knowen, the which if it shall appeare to be contrary, they were there readie for to suffer whatsoeuer punishment yt shold be giuen them. The viceroy being somewhat satisfied with this their iustification, bad them to depart, remitting all things vnto time for the true declaration thereof. Then Omoncon and Sinsay came straightwayes to giue ye Spaniards to vnderstand of all that had passed with the viceroy, &amp; what they vnderstoode of him, which caused in thē so great feare, yt for the time which it indured (which was till such time as they vnderstoode the truth as aforesaide) they paied very well for their feasts &amp; bankets the which they had made them. All this happened in the time that Omoncon &amp; Sinsay were at variance, and spake many iniurious words the one of ye other, discouering their intents &amp; deuises, whereby it plainely appeared that in al yt which they had tolde vnto the viceroy, they lied, but in especiall Omoncon. Sinsay did dissemble, for hee sayde and tolde vnto all people, that by his order and industrie, our people did

fire the shippes of Lymahon, and besieged him, with other spéeches in the like sort, yet twentie daies before his comming thether, all was ended and doone, as appeared. The occasion of their enimitie and falling out, was for that the viceroy had giuen vnto Omoncon a title and charge of more honor then vnto Sinsay hauing made betwixt them a consort that the reward or dignitie should be equally deuided betwixt them, and that the one should speake of the other the best they could, because the viceroy should do them friendship. This condition and consort (as appeareth) was euill performed by Omoncon being addicted vnto selfe loue, and séemed vnto him that Sinsay did not deserue so much as he did, for that hee was a base man, and of the sea, and he of the more nobilitie, and had the office of a captaine. All this which I haue said, was the occasion yt the truth came to light betwixt them, and to cause the viceroye to suspect, that as they lyed in this, they might also fable in the burning of the ships and besieging of Limahon.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. XXVIII. The Gouernors of 
                        ••
                     e prouince do assemble together, to intreat of the Spaniardes busines, and are resolued, that they should returne vnto the Ilandes. They do see many curious thinges before their departure.
                  WIth this griefe and care remained the Spaniards certaine daies kept close in their lodgings, and were not visited so often as they were whē they first came thether, which did augment verie much their feare, till such time as they vnderstoode that the viceroy eyther of his owne good will, or else by some particular order from the king &amp; his counsell, had called together all the gouernours of that prouince of Aucheo to intreat of matters touching Limahō, as also in particular, why &amp; wherefore the Spaniards came thether, &amp; to resolue thēselues wholly in all things requisite for the same. So when that they were all come together, which was in a short time, &amp; amongst them the Gouernor of Chincheo, who by an other name was called Insuanto, they had particular méetings together with the Uiceroye, in the which they were all agréed to haue a generall méeting, whereunto should bee called the Castillos,
                     
and to demande of them in publike audience the cause of their comming (although notwithstanding they had giuen to vnderstand thereof vnto the Insuanto and vizroy) and being hearde, to giue them their answere according as they had determined: for the which vppon a day appointed they met all togither (but not the vizroy) in the house of the Cagontoc, and commanded to come before them the Castillas, who did accomplish their request with a great good will, for that they vnderstoode that they were called to entreat of their matter, either to tarry or depart. So when they came thither, they were commanded to enter into a mighty hall, whereas they were all set in verie rich chaires with great grauitie and maiestie. The Insuanto séemed to bée the chiefest amongst them, but whether it was for that hée was the principallest next vnto the vizroy (or as it was tolde them) for that it was he that sent Omoncon in the chase of the rouer Limahon they knew not, but so soone as they were entred into the hall, they were commanded to drawe nigh, there, whereas they were all placed, without bidding them to sit downe, neither did they vse any particular circumstances or curtesie.
                  The Insuanto tooke vpon him the charge, and demanded of the Spaniards (by meanes of the interpreter) what was the occasion of their comming into that country, and to declare their pretence, for that they would giue vnto them the resolute will of the vizroy, at whose commandement they were called and there assembled togither. The Spaniards answered vnto their request and said that their comming thither was to treat with them peace and friendship, by the order of the gouernor of ye 
                     Philippinas, who had his authority from the king of Spaine, with a particular charge euer since the said Ilands were discouered, who in all thinges that possible hath béene, haue shewed themselues not onely in words but in déedes, as vnto this day the gouernor dooth accomplish the same, in ransoming all such Chinos as they can finde, or come vnto their powers, and send them home frée into their countrie with giftes, and not in this only, but in other matters, which is not vnknowne vnto them: and more, that which lastly had happened in the destruction of the fléete, and the besieging of the rouer Limahon, with which newes they came 
                        •
                     hither to intreate and conclude betwéene them and the Castillias a perpetuall friendship: this was the

principall occasion of their comming, the which if they coulde bring it to passe (as a thing that did accomplish both the one and the other) they would with ye same news send word with the souldiers (who came with them for the same effect) vnto the gouernor of Manilla, who sent vs thither for that he might send the good successe thereof to the king of Spaine, and there to remaine in such place as they woulde appoint them to studie the learning of the language, and to preach &amp; declare to them ye holy gospell, which was the right way vnto the saluation of their soule. Unto all the which they gaue attentiue eare, although with little desire to see the experience, as appeared, for that the chiefest matter in effect, they did let passe, and asked of them in what order they left the rouer Limahon, and whether hée might escape or not, and other questions touching the same matter which endured a good while without touching of anie other matter in effect. The Spaniards answered as they thought, and supposed, that at that time it could not be, but that he was either taken prisoner or slaine.
                  Then did the Insuanto conclude his spéech in saying vnto them that they should returne vnto their owne country to the Ilands, and at such time as they did bring Limahon, they woulde conclude all things touching the friendship they requested, as also for the preaching of the gospell.
                  So with this last resolution they tooke their leaue and went vnto their lodging with pretence not to speake more of that matter, for that they sawe it booted not: after they had giuen their censure: and againe, as they vnderstood it was by speciall order from the king and his counsaile, and therewith they beganne to put all thinges in good order for their departure, the which they greatly desired, for that they saw little fruite to procéede of their great labour and trauell, as also to sée themselues cleare of that manner of prison in the which they were, not to go forth of their lodgings without expresse licence.
                  So from that day forwards they did procure with all haste for to depart, and gaue the vizroy to vnderstande thereof, who answered them and saide, that they should comfort themselues and receiue ioy and pleasure, and that he would dispatch them, so soone as the visitor of that prouince was come to Aucheo, which would bee within tenne dayes, for that hee had written

vnto him, that he should not dispatch them vntil his comming, for that he would sée them.
                  From that day forwards hee commaunded that sometimes they should let them to go forth abrode to recreate themselues, and that they should shew vnto them some particular pleasure or friendship. So one of them was carried to sée the mustering of their men of warre, which they haue in a common custome throughout all the kingdome to doo it the first day of 
                        •
                     he newe moone, and is sure a thing to be séene: and they do it in the field which is ioyning vnto the wals of the citie, in this manner following.
                  There were ioyned togither litle more or lesse then 20. thousand souldiers, pickemen and hargabus shot,The vse of their mustering. who were so expert, that at the sounde of the drum or trumpet, they straightwayes put themselues in battle aray, and at another sound in a squadron, and at another the shot doo deuide themselues from the rest, and discharge their péeces with very gallant and good order, and with a trice put themselues againe into their places or standings: this being doone, the picke men came foorth and gaue the assalt altogether with so good order &amp; consort, that it séemed vnto the Spaniards that they did excéed al the warlike orders vsed in all the world: and if it were so that their stoma
                        •
                     ks and hardinesse were equall vnto their dexteritie and number of people, it were an easie thing for them to conquer the dominion of all the world. If it so chance that any souldier should lacke in his office, &amp; not repaire to his place appointed,Souldiers are punished. he is straightwayes punished very cruelly, which is the occasion that euerie one of them hath a care vnto his charge.Their mustering is one throughout the whole kingdome.
                  
                  This their mus
                        ••
                     r endured foure houres, and it was certifi
                        •
                     d vnto the Spainiards that the same day and houre it is done in oll citties and townes throughout all the whole kingdome, although they are without suspection of enimies.
                  Fiue and twentie dayes after that the Insuanto had giuen the resolute answere vnto the Spaniards, came the visitor thither: and the whole citie went forth to receiue him, who entred in with so great maiestie, that if they had not knowne who hée was, they could not haue béene perswaded but that he had beene the king.
                  So the next day following the Spaniards went to visite

him, for dueties sake, as also for that he had a desire to sée them They found him in his lodging, where he began to make visitation of the cittie.
                  In their courtes were an infinite number of people which came thither with petitions and complaintes, but in the halles within, there was none but his seruants and sergeants. When that any came for to present his petition, the porter that was at the entrie made a great noise in manner of an .o. est. for that it was a good way from the place whereas the visitor did sit, then commeth forth straightwayes one of his pages, and taketh the petition and carrieth it in vnto him. At this time it was told him how that the Castillas were there: hee commaunded that they should enter, and talked with them a few words, but with great curtesie, and all was touching the imprisonment of Limahon without making any mention of their departure or tarrying. So after a while that he had beholded them and their apparel, hee tooke his leaue of them, saying, that by reason of the great businesse he had in that visitation, he could not shewe them any curtesie, neither to vnderstande of them what their request and desire was, but gaue them great thankes for their curtesie shewed, in that they woulde come to visite him. Hee was set in the same visitation after the same manner and order as they founde the gouernor of Chincheo, and the vizroy, with a table before him, with paper, ynke, and other thinges readie to write, the which according as it was giuen them to vnderstand, is a common vse in all ye kingdome, vsed with al Iudges, whether it be for sentence of death, or other matters of iustice, as hath béene told you many times before.
                  Thrée dayes after the visitor was come thither, the Insuanto departed for his owne house, with order that with all spéede possible he should ordaine shippes wherin the Castillias should returne vnto the Philippinas.
                  
                  Likewise the same day, all those that were there assembled by the order of the vizroy departed vnto their owne houses. And the Spaniards were commanded for to s
                        •
                     ay vntill the full of the moone, which should bee the twentith of August, and that day they shoulde take their leaue of them: for on that day amongst them it is holden for good to beginne any thing whatsoeuer.Superstitiō. Wherein they doo vse great superstition, and doo make

many banquets, as vppon newyeares day, as hath béene tolde diffusedly.
                  The day before ye departure of ye Spaniards, there came some in behalfe of the vizroy to inuite them, and made them banquet in the order and fashion as at the first: although this (for that it was at their departure) was more sumptuous, wherein was represented a comedie which was very excellent &amp; good, whose argument was first declared vnto them as followeth.
                  There was a young man newly married, and there chanced difference betwixt him and his wife, hee determined to go vnto certaine warres, the which was ordained in a countrie not farre from that whereas he dwelled: whose acts and déeds was therein so valorous, that the king did shewe him great fauour, and being fully certified of his worthinesse, he sent him for chief Captaine of the most importunate enterprises that might bée offered, who did accomplish his charge with conclusion thereof with great content and satisfaction to the king and his counsailers: for the which he made him his captaine generall, and in his absence did commit vnto his charge his whole campe, with the same authoritie that he had himselfe.
                  The warres being doone, and hee hauing a desire to returne vnto his owne countrie and house, there was giuen vnto him thrée cart loads of golde, and many iewels of an inestimable price, with the which hee entered into his owne countrie with great honour and riches, wheras they receiued him with great honour.
                  All the which they did represent so naturally, &amp; with so good apparell and personages, that it séemed a thing to passe in act. There was not in this banket the vizroy, but those captaines which were there the first time: and another captaine vnto whome was giuen the charge to bring the Spaniards vnto Manilla, who was called Chautalay, a principall Captaine of that prouince.
                  So when the banquet was ended, they were carried with great company from the hall whereas the banquet was made, vnto the house of the Cogontoc, who was the kings tresuror and dwelt there hard by, of whom they were maruellously wel receiued, with louing words and great curtesie: in saying that he hoped very shortly to sée them againe, at such time as they

shall returne with Limahon, and that as then their friendship should be fully concluded, and would intreat with them in particular of other matters. This being doone he gaue vnto them a present for to carrie vnto the gouernor of Manilla in recompence of that which was sent vnto the vizroy: the present was fortie péeces of silke and twenty péeces of Burato a litter chaire and guilt, and two Quitasoles of silke, and a horse. Likewise he sent the like present vnto the generall of the fielde, and to either of th
                        •
                     m a letter in particular: these things were put in chestes which were very faire and guilt. Besides this hee gaue other fortie peeces of silke of all colours for to bée part

                     d amongst the Captaines and other officers that were at the siege of Limahon with thrée hundred blacke mantles and as many Quitasoles to be parted amongst the souldiers. Besides all these, hée gaue vnto the friers ech of them eight péeces of silke, and vnto the souldiers their companions foure péeces of ech of them,To keepe away the sun. and to euery one his horse and a Quitasol of silke, their h
                        •
                     rse were verie good to trauell by the way: this being done the Cogontoc tooke his leaue of them, and willed them to go and take leaue and licence of the vizroy and the visitor, that they might depart, for that all thinges were in a redinesse for their voyage: the which commandement they did straightwayes accomplish, being very well content and satisfied of the great fauours and curtesies, the which they receiued both of the one and the other: Likewise of the Totoc who is captaine generall, whome they also did visite &amp; tooke their leaue. These visitations and leaue taking being doone, they returned vnto their lodging with great desire for to toke their ease, whereas they remained til the next day following, wherin they departed vnto the port of Tansuso, after they had remained in Aucheo seuen and forty daies.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXIX. The Spaniards departe from Aucheo, and come vnto Chincheo, wheras the Insuanto was: he commanded thē to depart vnto the port of Tansuso, whither he went himself for to dispatch them: at whose departure, he sheweth great fauor and maketh them great feastes.
                  THe Spaniards departed from the Citie of Aucheo vpon a Tewsday, being the 23. of August in the sight of all the

people of the Citie, who came foorth to sée them with so great presse and thronge, as they did when they first came thither into the countrie: they were al carried in litter chaires, yea their verie slaues, for that it was so commaunded by the vizroy: the Friers were carried by eight men a péece, and the souldiers by foure men a péece, and all their seruants and slaues were caried by two men a péece. Looke so many men as was to carrie them, there went so many more to help them when they waxed weary, besides foure and twentie that carried their stuffe. There went alwayes before thē a harbinger for to prouide their lodgings, &amp; with him went a paimaster, whose charge was to ordain &amp; prouide men for to cary their litter chaires, &amp; to giue them for their trauell that which is accustomed, &amp; to pay all costs &amp; charges spent by the Spaniard. After that they departed from Aucheo they made of two daies iourney one, which was ye occasion that they came to Chincheo in foure daies. At their entring into the citie they found a seruant of the Insuanto, with order &amp; commandemēt, that they shuld proceed forwards on their iourney, &amp; not to stay in the citie, but to go vnto the port of Tansuso, whither he wil come the next day following. They obayed his cōmandement, &amp; made so much haste yt in two dayes they came vnto the village of Tangoa, wheras they had bin before, &amp; particular mention made thereof. In the same village they were lodged, wel entertained and had great good chéere: from thence they went in one day to Tansuso, which was ye first port wheras they did disembarke thēselues, when as they came from the Ilands vnto that firme land: the Iustice of the town did lodge them in ye same house whereas they were first lodged, &amp; did prouide for them of all things necessary &amp; néedfull, &amp; that in aboundance, til ye comming of the Insuanto, which was within foure dayes after, for that he could not come any sooner (although his desire was) for that it was very foule weather.
                  The next day after his comming thither which was ye thirde of September, he sent and commanded the Spaniards that they should imbarke themselues, for that it was that day the coniunction of the moone (although at that time ye ships were not fu
                        •
                     ly in a redines.) They obayed his commandement, &amp; the Insuanto himself went to the water side, in whose presence came thither certain religious men of their maner, &amp; after their fashion they

made sacrifice with certain Orations and praiers, in the which they craued of the heauens to giue good and faire weather, and a sure voyage and fauorable seas vnto al those that saile in those shippes.
                  This ceremony being done (which is a thing very much vsed in that countrie) the Spaniards went vnto the Insuanto, who was there with great company and maiestie: hee entertained them very friendly and with chéerefull words making an outward shew that hee bare them great loue, and that their departure was vnto him a great griefe. Then hee requested them to giue him a remembrance of such thinges as was necessarie and néedfull for their prouision for the sea, for that hee woulde giue order for the prouiding of the same, the which he did, and was with so great aboundance that they had for the voyage, and remained a great deale to spare. Hee then commaunded to bee brought thither cates to eat, and drinke, and gaue it them with his owne hands, as well the one as the other: hee himselfe did eate and drinke with them, which is the greatest fauour that can be shewed amongst them.
                  The banquet being ended, he commaunded them in his presence to go abord their shippes, because that was a luckie day, and also to accomplish that which the vizroy had commaunded, which was that they should not depart from thence, vntil they had first séene them imbarked. The Spaniards obeyed the commandement, and tooke their leaue of the Insuanto with great curtesie and reuerence, and with outward shewes that they remained indebted for the great curtesie and good will that they had receiued: and therewith they departed to the waters side, towards the boat which was tarrying for them.
                  As they passed by the religious men (that before we spake of) they saw a great table set,S
                           •
                        range sacrifices. and vppon it a whole Oxe with his throte cut, and hard by the same a Hogge and a Goate, &amp; other thinges to bee eaten: the which they had ordained for to make sacrifice, which they do vse in the like affaires.
                  They being imbarked in the boate, they were carried aborde the Admirall, which was the shippe appointed for them to go in: then presently they beganne to stirre the shippe, from one place vnto another with certain boates and cables which they had there readie for the same purpose. The shippe did not so

soone begin to moue, but the religious men a shore did beginne their sacrifice, the which did indure vntill night, ending their feastes and triumphes in putting forth of the cittie, and vppon their gates many cressets and lights. The souldiers shot off all their hargabushes, and the ships that were in the port shot off all their artilerie, and on the shore a great noise of droms and bels: all the which being ended and done, the Spaniards went a shore againe vnto their lodging: but first the Insuanto was departed vnto his owne house, with all the company that hee brought with him.
                  The next day the sayd Insuanto did inuite them vnto a banket, which was as famous as any which had bene made them vnto that time. He was at the banquet himselfe, and the Captaine generall of all that prouince. There was aboundance of meates and many pretie deuises to passe away the time, which made the banquet to indure more then foure houres: the which being done, there was brought forth the present which the Insuanto did sende vnto the gouernor of Manilla in returne of that which was sent to him. The present was fourtéene pieces of silke for the gouernor of Manilla, and tenne péeces for the generall of the field: hee also commanded to be giuen vnto the Friers each of them foure péeces, and vnto the souldiers each of them two péeces, and vnto their seruants and slaues certaine painted mantels, and there with he tooke his leaue of them very friendly, and gaue vnto them letters, the which hee had wrote vnto the gouernor, &amp; vnto the general of the field, answere vnto those, the which they had wrote vnto him, &amp; said that all things necessarie for their departure was in a redinesse, with victuals for ten monethes put a bord their ships, so that when as winde and wether did serue they might depart. Also that if in their voyage it should so fall out, that any of the Chinos that went in their shippes, shoulde do vnto them any euill, either abr
                        •
                     de or at the Ilands: that the gouernor therof should punish them at his pleasure, and how that the vizroy will thinke well thereof: in conclusion he saide vnto them, that hee hoped to sée them there againe verie shortly, and to returne againe with Limahon, and then hee woulde supplie the wantes which nowe they lacked. The Spaniards did kisse his hands, and said, that they had receiued in curtesie more then they deserued, &amp; that in

all thinges, there did abound and not lacke, that they remained greatly indetted vnto him for their friendship, and would giue their king notice thereof, that whensoeuer occasion shoulde bee offered, to repay them with the like: and therewith the Insuanto departed to his owne house, leauing in the companie of the Spaniards fiue captaines, those which should go with them in their company to sea, and also Omoncon and Sinsay, who were that day in the banquet, with the habite and ensigne of Loytias, for that the day before it was giuen vnto them by the Insuanto.
                  
                  Upon Wednesday which was the fourtéenth of September the wind came faire, wherewith they hoised vp their sailes and went to sea: at their departure there was at the waters side the Insuanto and the Iustice of Chincheo to sée them saile, the which Insuanto had conceiued so great loue and friendship of the Castillas, that when he saw them depart, he shedde great aboundance of teares, as was affirmed by diuers Chinos that saw it, to which the Spaniards gaue credite vnto, for that they knew him to be a maruellous louing person, and humaine, of a good condition, and of a gallant personage, and did excéede all other that they had séene in all the time of their being in that prouince.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXX. The Spaniardes departe from the port of Tansuso towards the Ilandes Philippinas, and euery day they doo harbor themselues in Ilands by the way, declaring what they saw in them.
                  BEing departed out of the port as aforsaide, the Spaniards deuided themselues into two shippes, to wit, the two Friers and Michael de Loarcha, Omoncon and thrée other captaines in one shippp. And Peter Sarmiento, Nicholas de Quenca and Iohn▪ 
                     de Triana, Sinsay and all their souldiers in another ship, with eight other ships of warre which went with them for their safegard: they sailed forwards directing their course towards a small Iland that was not farre off, with determination there to take water for their ships, for that it had in it many riuers of very swéete water. Within a smal space they

ariued there, and it had a very faire and sure port, wherein might ride in securitie a great Nauy of ships. All Thursday they were there recreating and sporting themselues, for that it was a pleasant Ilande, and full of fresh riuers. Uppon Friday being the sixtéenth of September, the day being somwhat spēt, they made saile and tooke port foure leagues from that place in another Ilande called Laulo, for to put themselues in a newe course different and contrary vnto that which they brought when as they came vnto that kingdome, for that the Chinos had by experience prooued, that in those monethes the windes were more fauorable then in other monethes, and for the most part North and Northeast winds: al that night they remained in that Iland, and the next day following they sailed vnto another Iland which was called Chautubo, not farre distant from that of Laulo. This Ilande was full of little townes, one of them was called Gautin which had fiue fortes of towers made of lime and stone, verie thicke and strongly wrought: they were all foure square, and sixe fatham high, and were made of purpose for to receiue into them al the people of those little townes to defend themselues from rouers and théeues that daylie come on that coast. These fortes were made with battlements as we do vse with space betwixt them: and for that the forme and fashion of their building did like them verie well, they were desirous to sée that if within them there were anie curious matter to bée séene, wherewith they bent their artilerie towards them, and went a shoore. But when they which had the gard
                        •
                      and kéeping off did sée them comming, they did shut the gates, and woulde not consent that they shoulde satisfie their desire, for any intreating or promises that they could make.
                  They verie much noted, that although this Ilande were rockie and sandie, yet was it tilled and sowed full of Rice, Wheate, and other séedes and graine. There was in it great store of Kine and Horse,Mine kine and horse. and they vnderstoode that they were gouerned, not by one particular man, to whom they were subiect, neither by any other amongst themselues, nor of China, but in common: yet notwithstanding they liued in great peace and quietnesse, for that euerie one did content himselfe with his owne. Uppon sunday in the afternoone they departed from this Ilande, and sailed their course all

that night, and the next morning they ariued at another Iland called Corchu, which was twentie leagues from the port of Tansuso from whence they departed. The Spaniards séeing what leasure they tooke in this their voyage, they requested the Captaines to commaunde the marriners that they shoulde not enter into so many portes or harbors, for that they had no certaintie of the weather, and not to detract the time, but to take oportunitie before that contrarie weather do come: for to saile in that order it seemed more for recreation then to achiue or obtaine a voyage. The Captaines answered, and requested them to haue patience, for that in making their iournies as they did, they doo accomplish and follow the order set downe by the vizroy and Insuanto, who did expressely commaunde them with great charge for to direct their Nauigation by those Ilands with great deliberation and consideration, because they might in safetie and health ariue at Manilla.
                  
                  The same day the North winde beganne to blowe verie strongly: in such sort, that they thought it not good to go forth of that harbor (as well for that aforesaid,The Chinos are fearefull of the sea. to be commanded to the contrarie) as also for that the Chinos are very searefull of the sea, and men that are not accustomed to ingulfe themselues too farre, neither to passe anie stormes.
                  Néere vnto this Iland there was another somewhat bigger, which is called Ancon, wholly dispeopled and without anie dwellers, yet a better countrie and more profitable for to sowe and reape then that of Corchu. The Spaniards being at an anker there, vnderstood by the Chinos that in times past it was very well inhabited, vnto the which ariued a great fléete belonging to the king of China, &amp; by a great storme were all cast away vpon the same: the which losse and destruction being vnderstood by another generall that had the guard of that cost, suspecting that the dwellers thereof had done that slaughter, he came to the shore and slew many of the inhabitants, and caried all the rest in their ships vnto the firme lande, who afterwards would neuer returne thither againe, although they gaue them licence after that they vnderstoode the truth of that successe: so that vnto that time it remained dispeopled and full of wilde swine, of the broode that remained there at such time as they were slaine and caried away as you haue heard.
                  
                     This Iland and the rest adioyning thereunto (which are very many) haue very excellent and sure ports and hauens, with great store of fish. These Ilands endured vntill they came vnto a little gulfe, which is fiue and fortie leagues ouer, and is sailed in one day, and at the ende thereof is the port of Cabite, which before we haue spoken off, and is neere vnto Manilla.
                  
                  So when that winde and weather serued their turne, they departed from the Iland of Ancon, and sailed til they came vnto another Ilande called Plon, whereas they vnderstoode by a shippe that was there a fishing, howe that the rouer Limahon was escaped, wheras he was besieged at Pagansinan: the manner and forme of the policie hee vsed therein shalbe told you in the chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXXI. They haue news how that the rouer Limahon was escaped, and howe that he was in an Ilande there hard by: some gaue iudgement to go and set vpon him, but they resolued themselues to the contrarie, and follow the voyage to Manilla.
                  BEing at an anker in the Iland of Plon, tarrying for a wind to followe their voyage, with great desire to come thither whereas they might vnderstande what had happened vnto Limahon, at the same time entred into the saide harbor a shippe with fishermen, they beléeuing that hee had béene one of the Ilands, they went vnto him and asked of whence they were, and from whence they came, and what newes they coulde say of Limahon (who was knowne vnto them all, either by some harme that they had receiued, or else by report of others that had receiued hurt.) These fishermen gaue them particular and whole relation, by the which they vnderstoode that Limahon was fledde and not perceiued by the Spaniards: he escaped in certaine barkes, the which he caused to be made very secretlie within his forte, of such timber and bords as remained of his shippes that were burnt, the which was brought in by night by his souldiers, on that side of the fort which was next vnto the riuer, and were not discouered by the Castillas, which

which were put there with all care and diligence to kéepe the mouth that no succour might come in to helpe them. And towards the land there whereas he might escape, they were with out all suspection (they were so strong) and did not mistrust that any such thing shoulde bee put in vre, as afterwards did fal out, the which was executed with so great policie and craft, that when they came to vnderstande it, the rouer was cleane gone, and in sauegard, caulking his barkes at the Ilande of Tocaotican, the better for to escape and saue himselfe, and they saide that it was but eight dayes past that hee fledde.
                  With this newes they all receiued great alteration, but in especiall▪ 
                     Omoncon and Sinsay, who returned vnto the Spaniards and saide, that the escaping of the rouer is not without some misterie, and that it coulde not bee done without the will and knowledge of the Spaniards, and that the rouer had giuen vnto the generall of the fielde some great gifts for to let him go, for that otherwise it were a thing impossible for him to escape, being besieged as hee was, although the Spaniards had slept: the Spaniards did giue their discharge in such prouable maner, that the captaines of China were satisfied of the false opinion they had receiued, as afterwards they were fully perswaded when they came to the cittie of Manilla and heard the generall of the fielde and other captaines and souldiers that were at t
                        •
                     e siege. This Iland of Tocaotican whereas the rouer was mending and caulking of his barkes, was distant from the Ilande of Plon, whereas the Spaniards were, onely twelue leagues, and being by sea it séemed to be lesse, for that very plainely you might see the one Ilande from the other. The which with the great cholor that Omoncon and Sinsay had for the escaping of the rouer, as also with the feare they receiued in that which might happen vnto them by reason hereof at their returne vnto China, which at the least might bée to take away (to their great shame) the titles of Loytias, which was giuen them in that respect, did cause their stomakes and mindes to rise, and to séeke occasion to go and fight with him, for that it séemed vnto them they should get victorie with great ease, for that hee was vnprouided and wearied with the long time of his siege. Being in this determination there came vnto them the Captaine that was appointed generall ouer them, and saide that the vizroy of

                     Aucheo and the gouernor of Chincheo had sent them onely to carrie those Spaniards vnto Manilla, and to bring with him aliue or deade the rouer Limahon, if they woulde giue him vnto them, and that hee woulde not digresse from this order by no manner of m
                        •
                     anes, neither could they, if that they w
                        •
                     re so disposed, for that the shippes were pestered with the horses: and againe, their people they had brought with them▪ was more for to saile and gouerne their shippes then for the sight. Moreouer the sight would be very dangerous for that it was euident that the rouer and his companions, would rather 
                        •
                     e al slaine then to yeelde themselues in any respect, and for to put such an enterprise in effect, it were requisite to haue both ships and men, and not to go so vnprouided and pestred as they were. All which reasons being considered, they were all conformable vnto the opinion of the Generall, and determined that so soone as winde and weather did serue, to set saile and to passe the gulfe for to go vnto Manilla, whither as they were bound, and not to come vnto the Ilande of Tocaotican whereas the rouer was.
                  So after they had remained thrée wéekes in that harbour detained with a mightie North winde, that neuer calmed night nor day in all that time. The eleuenth day of October two houres before day, they set saile and went to sea. By reason of this great wind there was not one shippe of all th
                        •
                     se that were in the port of Plon coulde go foorth to giue any notice vnto the rouer, of the going of the Spaniards, neither of the captaines of China. Sixtéene leagues from the port, sailing towards the South, they discouered a mightie Iland verie high land, which was called Tangarruan, and was of thrée score leagues about, all inhabited with people like vnto those of the Ilands Philippinas: they passed hard by it in the night, with a s
                        •
                     iffe Norwe
                        •
                     t winde, which was the occasion that the shippe wherein the Friers went, was constrained to go to sea, and the other nine which were in their companie for their safegarde, shrowded themselues hard vnder the Iland, by reason whereof they were so farre separated the one from the other, that in the morning they coulde not sée them. They were in great da
                        •
                     ger, because that night there was a great storme of winde, in the which they lost the rudder of their shippe, and almost without any hope to escape the fury thereof.
                  
                     Being in this extremitie, they commended themselues with contrite hearts vnto almightie God, and put their shippe before the sea, vntill such time as they had supplied their rudder, the which they did, although with great trauell and labour: then straightwayes it was the will of God that this contrary wind was somewhat calmed and his furie abated, and a prosperous winde fauoured them, so that vppon sunday in the morning being the seuentéenth day of October they discouered the Iland of Manilla of them greatly desired, yet could they not reach vnto it vntill saint Simon and Iudes day: by reason that they returned backe vnto the ri
                        •
                     er of Pagansinan to séeke the other nine shippes, for that it was concluded amongst them, that if it should so fall out, they to be separated in any storme, that they should come vnto that riuer, and to méete togither as they did.
                  So they departed from thence vnto the port of Buliano, &amp; not entring therin, the captaine Omoncon did set a man on shore, one that could speake the language of that Iland, and gaue him charge to informe himselfe of all that had happened with the rouer Limahon, for at that time he could not beléeue that which had béene told him. Untill such time as he returned the shippes being without at the sea, did play vnder fore sailes, who did declare vnto them the verie same thing, the which was tolde them at the Ilande of Plon without faultring any point: the which caused Omoncon and Sinsay to receiue much more griefe then they did, when they heard the first newes, for as then they were doubtfull of the truth. The Spanyards as then suspected that they would haue returned vnto the firme lande, and not haue gone vnto Manilla, but to haue left them there all alone vpon that Iland. But it fell not out as they suspected: For although that Omoncon and Sinsay did make an outward shew to doo it, and sayde that they would sende the Spanyards in a shippe, for that as then they were out of all danger, and in sight of Manilla: yet was the Generall of a contrarie opinion, and sayd, that for no manner of occasion that might happe
                        •
                      hee would not differ one point from the order which was giuen vnto him, and therewith they sayled towards the Iland that they so long desired to sée, and came thither the twentie eight day of October, ss aforesaid.
                  
                     So that from the port of Tansuso which is the first port of China till they came vnto the Iland of Manilla they were fiue and fortie dayes, and is not in all full two hundred leagues,From the Philippinas to the China is two hundred leagues. which may bee made with reasonable wether in tenne dayes at the most.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXXII. The captaines Chinos ariued with the Spaniardes at the citie of Manilla, the Gouernor and those of the citie doo receiue them with great ioy and triumphes, and after they had remained there certaine dayes, they returned vnto the firme land, being instructed and satisfied of many things touching our holy catholike faith, with great desire to receiue the same.
                  AFter that it was knowen vnto the Gouernor of the citie of Manilla and vnto the generall of the fielde as also vnto the rest of the captaines and souldiers of the ariuall of the Spaniardes, whom they with great care desired to heare of, as well for the particular loue they deare vnto them as also for to vnderstand and heare the newes from that mightie kingdome of China, to be declared by witnesses of so great faith and credite. They altogether went foorth to receiue them with great ioye and pleasure, and likewise all such captaynes and souldiers as came in their companie.
                  They were straightwaies conueighed vnto their lodginges to rest themselues of their long iourney which they had by sea, for it was requisite and néedefull: for the which afterwardes there was great feastes and bankets, which was made by the Gouernor, the generall of the field and other particular persons vnto the Chinos, in recompence of that which was done vnto the Spaniards in their countrie.
                  All which feastes did giue them little content when as they did remember the flying and escape of the Rouer, but in especiall Omoncon and Sinsay, who continually &amp; euery moment did call vpon the generall of their fleete to make haste &amp; to shorten the time that they might depart from the firme land, where giuing notice vnto the Gouernor of Chincheo of the estate of Limahon, he might giue order that before he had reedified and

repayred himselfe they might take him (which is a thing most desired in all that kingdome). The generall was verie glad, and reioyced of their good intertainement, and answered vnto Omoncon &amp; Sinsay, saying that by reason of the great storme and foule weather past, their ships had great néede of reparation, and likewise the marriners to ease themselues, the which being done he would with all his heart depart.
                  The generall of the fielde was verie sorrowfull and much gréeued for that the Rouer Limahon was so escaped, and the more when he vnderstoode that he was suspected that hee did consent vnto his departure: for which occasion, if that the Captaynes had not béene verie much wearied with the long siege, and euill weather which happened in that time, without all doubt he would haue followed him, and neuer to haue left him till he had taken or slaine him.
                  Although they were fully perswaded that Limahon was so terrified with the great perill and danger in the which he was, and againe with so small number of people, that rather hee would desire to put himselfe in securitie then to offende or doo any harme, neyther to put himselfe in any place whereas hee might receiue damage of any of them to whom hee had doone so open wrong (who were so much desirous to be reuenged) who for to preuent all that might happen (as after we vnderstoode) hauing made readie his barkes and boates which he ordayned in his fort, and put in them victualles for their iourney, he departed with his small number of people, vnto an Ilande farre
                        •
                     off and vnknowen, there whereas he vnderstoode that none would goe to séeke him, and there hee remayned a time whereas he fell sicke of a melancholicke infirmitie which grewe by an imagination that hee had, to remember in what state he was at that time, and howe he had séene himselfe at other times feared throughout al the kingdome of China, which was an imagination sufficient for to bring him to his ende: his companions were dispersed abroad, so that we neuer heard more of them.
                  Now returning to our purpose, after that the China Captaines had recreated them selues with the feastes and sportes that was made vnto them, and taken recreation many dayes, and tarryed hoping that the weather would proue fayrer to

prepare themselues to depart. In the same time they did intreat of many thinges in particular touching Christian religion, whereof with great care they did informe themselues of our religious men, and tolde them some secret things that were vnknowen vnto them of their countrie, for that they were strangers.
                  So when as time and weather did serue, they did take their leaue, with many signes and tokens of griefe for to depart and leaue the conuersation of so good companions, and did promise vnto them to procure all that was possible that the friendshippe begunne betwixt them and the Chinos, should continue and perseuer, for that it was a thing that did content them all.
                  Their generall himselfe did take this particular charge vnto himselfe, with a determinate purpose for to declare in effect to the Gouernour of Aucheo (whose priuate seruant he was) the good meaning of the Castillos, and what principall people they were, and the ceremonies they vsed, with the which hee was marueilously in loue. Likewise hee would giue him to vnderstande of the flying of the Rouer Limahon, how and in what manner and order it was, and how that the generall of the field and the other captaines were in no fault thereof. This he would do in respect that if it should so fall out that Omoncon and Sinsay for their owne credite should declare any thing against the Spaniardes that was not true, that they might not be beléeued.
                  Besides all this he tolde the Gouernour certaine thinges in secret, how they might with great ease purchase the friendship they pretended. And amongest them all, one was, that hee should make a supplication vnto the catholike king, in requesting him to write a letter vnto their king, and sende him Embassador, and such as shoulde giue vnto them the light of the Catholike and Christian faith, with the which diligence 
                        •

                      for that there are manye ceremonies vsed amongest them which doo much resemble those of our Christian religion, and againe in their liuing morally, they doo obserue in manie thinges the tenne commandementes of Gods lawe,

of the which in particular he did informe himselfe, so that the greatest difficultie was in the entring in of the preaching of the holy gospell, and beeing by this meanes ouer come, in a short time all the whole kingdome would turne Christians. And considering that in their worshipping, as they doo worship all thinges in the seconde essence, with great facilitie they would change their adoration and giue it vnto the first, as most worthie, and vnto whom it is their duties. The generall did adde more thereunto, and saide that he was so much aff
                        •
                     ctioned vnto the faith of the Christians, that if it were not that he should be banished and loose his countrie, house and landes, without all doubt he would haue béene baptised: the which he could not do without loosing of all, for that they haue a law in their countrie, the which is obserued and kept inuiolably, by the which it is forbidden that none whatsoeuer, can receiue any strange religion differing from theirs vpon paine of death, without the consent of the king and his counsell.
                  This law was made to take away nouelties, and to liue all in one vniformitie of religion, with one manner of rites and ceremonies.
                  This only was the occasion that certaine marchants of China being affectioned vnto the law of the gospell, were baptised at the Philippinas, and there doo dwell at this day in the citie of Manilla amongest the Spaniardes, and are become verie good Christians.
                  So with these offers and with promises to be great friendes vnto the Spaniardes, the Generall departed from Manilla to goe vnto the firme lande, and with him the other Captaynes Omoncon and Sinsay with great hope that verie shortly they should be all of one faith. So the one tooke their leaue of the other with reasons of great affection and tokens of great loue signifying that in any thing that should be offered they should finde them friendly.
                  They being departed, the Spaniardes remayned verie carefull in praying vnto the diuine maiestie, desiring of him to direct all thinges in this their request, that it might be to his holy seruice, and also to inspire the catholike maiestie of king Phillip their Lorde for to sende his Embassador vnto the king of China, offering his friendship, and to admonish him to receiue

the faith of Christ, the which according vnto the report of the Austen Fryers that entred into that countrie (of whom we haue made mention manie times in this booke with their companions) and also the Generall of China tolde them that there was no other means but only that for to bring their purpose to effect.
                  This counsell with all the spéede possible they put in vre, and sent vnto his maiestie one of purpose, and in the name of all them of those Ilandes to request him, and to declare how much it did import. They sent vnto him this relation with manie particular persons for to mooue his most Christian minde, for to sende an Embassador, as in effect hee did, in that sort as hath béene tolde you in the last Chapter of the thirde Booke of this historie, whereas it is declared in particular, and in what estate it doth remaine vnto this day. God for his mercies sake direct all thinges, that it may be to his seruice and glorie, and the saluation of so many soules.

               The second booke of the second part of the historie of the mightie kingdome of China, In the which is contayned the voyage that was into that kingdome in the yeare 1576. by the fathers Fryer Peter de Alfaro Costodio in the Ilandes Philippinas of the order of saint Francis of the prouince of S. Ioseph, and other three religious men of the same order, and their miraculous entring into that kingdome, and what happened vnto them for the space of seuen monthes that they there remained, and what they did see and vnderstand of: all the which are notable and verie rare.
               
                  CHAP. I. The Fryers of Saint Francis came vnto the Ilandes Philippinas, and procured to passe vnto the firme lande of the kingdome of China, with zeale to preach the holy gospell.
                  
                     THe day of the visitation of our Ladie in the yeare 1578. there came out of Spaine to the Citie of Manilla in the Ilandes Philippinas, the father Fryer Peter de Alfaro, who, went for Costodio of that prouince and fourteene more other religious persons of the same order in his companie, and were sent by the king of Spaine and his royall Counsel of the Indias, for to be ayders and helpers of the Austen Fryers, who vntill that time had béene there alone in those Ilandes, occupied in the conuerting of the people in that countrie, and were the first ministers of the gospell, preaching the same with great zeale, vnto the profite of their soules: of the which people, those Fryers had baptised (when the others ariued) more then one hundred thousande, and the rest prepared and cathecised to receiue the like. Because that at the first occasion that might be giuen, they might enter into the kingdome of China to preach the holy gospell. The which Fryers when

that they had béen there the space of one yeare occupying themselues in the same exercise in preaching and conuerting the people of that countrie. In the same time they were giuen to vnderstande by the relation of the selfe same Austen Fryers, as also by many marchants of China, which came vnto them with marchandice, of things to be wondred at of that mightie kingdome, and of the infinite number of soules which the diuell had deceiued and brought vnto his seruice with false Idolatrie. The which being by them well vnderstood, they did burne with great zeale and desire of their saluation, and to goe and preach the gospell, although it were to put their persons in whatsoeuer hazarde or danger.
                  So with this their great desire, they did many and diuerse times communicate with the gouernor that was there at that time for his maiestie, who was called the Doctor Francisco de Sandi, desiring his fauour and licence for to goe vnto China in the companie of certaine marchants of that countrie, that were at that present in the port with their ships, offering themselues to get their good will, although it were to offer themselues to be slaues or otherwise whatsoeuer. And séeing that at all such times when as they did intreat of that matter, they found him but luke warme, and that he did (as it were) but to detract the time, and feed them with hope. then they calling to minde, that the chiefest intent and cause of their comming out of Spayne, was to enter into that kingdome, caused a newe desire to grow in them, what with the contractation they had with the sayde Chinos, as well in conuersation as in talke, and finding them to be a people of great abilitie and discretion, and of verie good iudgements, the which did greatly content their desire, they did perswade themselues that it was an easie matter to make them to vnderstande the thinges appertayning vnto God. So that they determined to put other remedies in practise, because that which they required with the good will of the Gouernor, séemed to be a large and long matter. So it happened that vpon a time intreating of this matter, and hauing requested of God with great instance for to direct them the readie way which was best for his seruice, and for the profite of those soules, there came to the Ilandes Philippinas a Chino, who according as they did vnderstand, was one of the priests &amp; religious

men of that kingdome (of the which priestes there are a great number in euerie towne) this priest went diuerse times vnto the monasterie of the Fryers, and did common with them of the creation of the worlde and other things which did open the way that they might declare vnto him thinges appertayning vnto God, vnto the which he did harken with great good will. And after that hee had declared vnto them in particular the mightinesse and secretes of this mightie kingdome of China (whose conuersion they so greatly desired) he very inquisitiuely asked of them matters touching the Christian faith, of whome within a fewe dayes after he desired to be baptised, for that he would be a Christian, being instructed before in many matters touching our catholike faith.
                  Our religious men did accomplish his desire, the which was an incredible ioy vnto all the dwellers of the Citie, and a content vnto himselfe.
                  So after that he was made a Christian hee remayned in the monasterie amongest the other, but yet would he neuer eate any other thing but colde herbes:The Spaniards rise at thei midnight mattens and whip themselues. and he séeing that all the religious men did arise vp at midnight to mattens and discipline themselues, spending the greatest part of the night in prayer before the holy sacrament, hee did not faile one point, but did imitate them in all their dooings, with outwarde showes of a verie good will. All the which did incyte the Fryer Costodio and al the rest of his companions to put in execution their great desire they had, according as it hath beene tolde you. Whereupon he went once againe vnto the gouernour to intreat him by faire meanes that which before they had comoned with him of▪ and that he would procure some order or meanes, that those religious men might go to the kingdome of China to preach the lawe of God, offering himselfe to be one of them, with protestation that if he would not giue them leaue, they would procure to goe without it, with that authoritie the which hee had of God and of his superiors, for to teach and instruct these poore Infidels their neighbors: and this should be done with the first oportunitie they might finde or haue.
                  But neither this, nor yet the example of that good Chino, which was newe christened was sufficient to perswade the gouernor to consent vnto their request, but peseuering in his

first opinion, he answered and said, that it was too timely, and that the friendship which they had with ye 
                     Chinos, as yet was very small. And how that the fathers of S. Austen had manie times attempted the entrie into that kingdome, and yet neuer could obtaine their desire. And howe that the Chinos that did carrie them did deceiue them, and left them in certaine Ilands, till such time as they heard farther newes of the Rouer Limahon, and of the returne of the Captaine Omoncon, who did carrie them with the good newes of the straight siege in the which they had the rouer: and yet for all that they commanded them to returne from Aucheo, without giuing them anie licence to remaine in the countrie to preach the holy gospell, and nowe to attempt the same, was but to giue occasion vnto the Chinos euerie day to mocke and make a iest of the Spaniardes, and willed them to staye till such time, as it were the will of God to giue way vnto the same, which could not be long.
                  This Fryer Costodio vnderstanding the answere of the Gouernour, perseuering still in his first opinion, and did not goe about to séeke any meanes to accomplish their desire for the entring into the firme lande, hee straightwayes beganne secretly to procure by all meanes possible to attempt and accomplish that iourney, although it were without the order and consent of the Gouernour (when that it might not be doone otherwise) the which incontinent they beganne to put in vre, for that the Fryer Costodio and Fryer Steuen Ortiz (who was a religious man that for the great desire he had, did learne the China tongue, and at that time did speake it resonablie) they both together did giue to vnderstande of their desire and pretence vnto a deuout souldier of their religion and one that they made great account of, who was called Iohn Dias Pardo, who often times had made manifest vnto them and saide, thae he had a great desire to doo some especiall seruice vnto God, although it were to hazarde his life in the same, who at that instant did accomplish his desire, and did promise them to beare them companie vnto the death.
                  So with this conformitie they went straightwayes altogether to speake with a Captaine of China that was in the same port in a shippe of his owne, who many times did repayre

vnto their couent, to aske of them thinges appertayning vnto God, and the heauens, with showe of a very good vnderstanding, who vnto their iudgement did consent and accept all with great pleasure and delight.
                  Unto this captayne they did giue to vnderstande the effect of all their desire, requesting him of his ayde and helpe in the prosecuting of the same. Who straightwayes did offer himselfe to accomplish their request and to carrie them vnto China, so as they woulde then giue him some thing for to bestowe amongest his marriners. The souldier Iohn Diaz Pardo did promise to giue them all that they would aske, and gaue them in earnest certaine ryalles of plate. And for that all thinges shoulde bée doone in good order, and in such sort that the Gouernour nor any other shoulde haue any suspition or knowledge, it was ordayned amongest them that the Captaine of China should with all spéede dispatch himselfe and depart to the port of Bindoro, which is twentie leagues from the citie of Manilla and there to tarrie for them, and to carrie in his companie the Chino that was new baptised as aforesaid.
                  The captaine made haste▪ dispatched himselfe and departed vnto the port appointed, &amp; within a fewe dayes after the father Costodio and his company with the souldier his friend did followe thē. But when they came thether they found the captaine Chino in an other mind, in such sort, that neither gifts nor faire intreatie was sufficient to perswad him, to performe that which he had promised in Manilla, but returned vnto them their earnest before receiued, affirming that for any thing in al ye world he would not carrie them, for that he knowe very well, if hee should so doo, it would cost him his life and goods.
                  The newe baptised religious Chino séeing that, wept bitterly, with discontentment to sée how the diuell had changed the minde of the Captaine, for that in that kingdome the holie gospell should not be preached. The father Costodio did resolue himselue to returne vnto Manilla and there to abide a better oportunitie, as in effect they did, whereas they remayned certayne dayes, till such time it happened as followeth.
                  Upon a day the Gouernour sent and called vnto him the father Costodio, and requested of him, that he would let him haue some Fryer for to sende vnto the riuer of Cagayan, whether

not long before he had sent certaine Spaniards for to inhabite.
                  The fryer Costodio promised him one, and that he should go with him in companie till he came to the prouince of Illocos whether he went, and that from thence he would dispatch him vnto the riuer of Cagayan, according vnto his worships commandement, requesting of him to haue in his cōpanie to kéepe watch &amp; warde in that iourney the ensigne Francisco de Duennas &amp; Iohn Diaz Pardo the souldier his friend as aforesaide, with pretence to depart frō thence vnto China, as in effect they did, as shall be tolde you. The gouernor being very willing for to pleasure him, did grant his request. So with great spéede he departed, and carried with him the foresaide souldiers, and for companion a religious man called Frier Austin de Tordesillas (he who afterwards did put in memorie all thinges yt passed with them in China) out of the which hath béene taken this small relation. So when they came vnto the Illocos, they found fryer Iohn Baptista and fryer Sebastian of S. Francis, of his owne order, occupied in the teaching and instructing the people of that prouince, which was the fourth day of Iune. The next day following they called a counsell, where it was concluded that all those that were there present would venture themselues for to go vnto China, to conuert those Gentiles or else to die in the quarrell. And the better to bring their purpose to passe, they thought it good to speake vnto an other souldier that was there with thē called Pedro de villa Roel, not telling vnto him their pretence because they would not be discouered (but asked him in this manner) if he would beare him cōpanie &amp; the other two souldiers, who altogether went about a busines of great honour and seruice of God, and the benefite &amp; sauing of many soules, and that he would declare vnto them whether he would go or not, without asking whether nor from wh
                        •
                     t place, for that as then they could not giue him to vnderstand, till time did serue. His answere was, that straightwaies he would beare them companie, and would neuer leaue them to death.
                  So foorthwith they all together with singular ioy went to the ship wherin the father Costodio and his companion with the other two souldiers came in frō 
                     Manilla to ye place with a reasonable Frigat, although but with fewe marriners, &amp; they not verie expert. So being altogether in the shippe, with all such

thinges as they could get together in that small time for their prouision in that iourney, they made all thinges in a readinesse to set sayle the same day which was the twelfth day of the say
                        •
                      moneth of Iune. So after they had sayde masse and commended themselues vnto God, requesting him 
                        •
                     o direct their voyage that it might be to his glorie and seruice, they set sayle vppon a fryday in the morning, with intent to goe foorth of that port, but they could not by no meanes possible, for that the sea went verie loftie vpon the barre, and contending with the sea for to get foorth they were in great danger to haue béene cast away, which was the occasion that with great sorrow they returned into the port, whereas they remayned all day.
               
               
                  CHAP. II. The Fryers and their companions depart from the port of Illocos, after they had committed vnto God the direction of their voyage. They passe great daungers and troubles, &amp; do ouercome them all with the confidence they haue in God, and came vnto the kingdome of China miraculously.
                  SO the next day after they had committed thēselues to God with great deuotion▪ they embarked themselues and made sayle, and by the will of God they went out of the harbour although with great danger, &amp; they carryed with them an other barke a sterne their ship, in the which they did determine for to set a lande such Indians as they carried with them from the Esquipazon, to helpe them out of the harbour. the which they did not for feare they should be drowned. So when they were out of that riuer, they sayled towards the little Iland, that was but one league from that place, and there they put the Indians a shore, &amp; with thē a young man a Spaniard that they brought from Manilla to serue them. So those which should go on that voyage remained there the same night, who were the frier Costodio, frier Peter de Alfaro borne in Siuel, frier Iohn Baptista, borne in Pe
                           •
                        aro in Italy, fryer Sebastian de san Francisco of the citie of Boecia, and frier Augustin de Tordesillas, of the same towne whereof he hath his name, all these foure were priestes of the masse.
                  
                     The Fryer Costodio would with a very good will haue carried more of them, but he durst not for two causes, the one for that hee would not haue béene discouered, and the other (which was the principal occasiō) because he would not leaue that prouince of the Illocos without such as shold instruct them, wheras were many baptised: for which respect, he left some behind him, which afterwarde hee would haue béene very glad that they had béene in his companie. There were thrée Spaniards souldiers that did beare them companie, the one was called the ancient, Francisco de Duennas, of Velez Malaga, the other Iohn Diaz Pardo of Saint Lucas de Barameda the third Pedro de Villa-roel of the Citie of Mexico. Besides these they had a boy of China, who could speake the spanish tongue, and was one of them that were taken at the siege of Limahon the Rouer, and other foure Indians of Manilla.
                  
                  They departed from this little Ilande, vpon a munday the first quarter in the morning, which was the fiftéene day of the said moneth of Iune, and sayled that way, so nigh as they could gesse to be the way vnto China, without pilot or any other certaintie, more then that which God did shewe and put into their mindes, with their great desire, which séemed vnto them to comprehende and bring it to passe. This day the winde was contrarie and against them, which was the occasions that they sayled but little. Towardes the euening the winde changed and blewe at the north (the which winde vppon that coast is verie dangerous) which made them greatly afrayde: yet was that feare driuen away by an other feare much greater then that, which was that they should be discouered, and that they should be pursued by the commandement of the gouernour of Manilla: for which occasion whereas they should haue shrowded themselues vnder the land, they wrought contrary, and cast about vnto the sea in great danger to haue béene cast away, but it was the will of God that when as night came the winde did calme (which commonly falleth out to the contrary) but the sea remayned very rough and loftie that they thought verily to haue béene drowned with the furie thereof, for it tossed the Frigatta in such sort that it séemed a whole legion of diuels had taken holde on both sides of the shippe forcing the one against the other, that it rowled in such sort that many times the halfe

decke was in the water, so that the marriners could not stand vpon their féete,They were in great perill but were driuen to sustaine themselues by the ropes &amp; cavels. But the religious men trusting in God, whose zeale had caused them this great trouble, did pray and desire him with many teares that hee would deliuer them out of the same daunger: and not to giue place vnto the diuell for to disturbe them of their voyage and enterprise.
                  
                     The Friers vsed certaine coniurations for that S. Antonie was a sleepe.Those their orations and prayers did so much preuaile, with certaine coniurations which they made against the diuels (whō they thought they did see visibly) that after midnight the north winde ceased, and began to blowe at the north east, with the which the sea began to waxe calme, so yt they might make their way to be east northeast, for that they had intelligence, that that course was the shortest cut to the firme land. This winde which was so fauourable vnto thē, did increase so much in two houres, that the sea waxed loftie, and caused them to forget the sorrowe past, and constrained them (for that the shippe was but small) to cut their mast ouer borde, and to put themselues vnto the courtesie of the sea, with little hope to escape the danger. But our Lorde, whose zeale did mooue them to attempt that iourney, did direct their voyage in such sort that the next day 
                        •
                     ollowing it came to be calme, in such sort that they might set vp a newe mast in the place of that which was cut ouer borde in the storme, and therewith to nauigate forwardes with their begunne voyage. So vpon the fryday following at the breake of the day they sawe lande, and thinking that it had béene the firme lande. of China, they gaue thankes vnto God, and reioyced, in such sort that they had cleane forgotten the troubles of the stormes and foule weather passed, so they made towards it, and came thither about noone, but when they were a shore, they found that it was but a small Iland and situated foure leagues from the firme lande, and for that it was so nigh, a farre off it séemed to be all one thing. But when they came vnto this Ilande they did discouer many ships, which were so many in nū
                     ber that it séemed all the sea to be couered with thē. The friers, with the great desire they had for to knowe in what port they were, they cōmanded to gouerne their ship towardes whereas they were, who when they saw them &amp; could not know thē, by the strangenes of their ship and sailes they did fly from them all

that euer they could. The which ou
                        •
                      men perceiuing &amp; could not imagine the cause thereof, they were very much agréeued and sorrowfull, and the more for that they could not learne nor vnderstand where they were. But séeing nigh vnto them to the lewarde thrée ships, they made towardes them, and whē they were somwhat nigh they put themselues as the others did. In this sort they spent all the rest of the day in going from one port to an other, vnto those ships for to infirme thēselues where they were, but all this diligence preuailed them nothing at all till it was almost sunne set, they entred with their frigat into a gut vnder the shore, whereas fell from a high rocke which was more than one hundreth fatham by estimation a streme of water which was as bigge as the bodies of two men together.
                  In this gut there was thrée other ships and they came to an anker in the middest amongest them, the which beeing done they asked of them what countrie that was, but they answered nothing, nor made any semblance, but looked the one vpon the other, &amp; in beholding of the Spaniards they gaue great laughters. In this gut they remained all that night almost amased to sée how those people were as though they were inchanted, and they without any light of their desire, which was to knowe wher they were. So ye next day folowing (which was saterday) verie early in the morning they set sayle and went amongest a great sort of Ilandes alwayes bearing vnto them, which they thought to be the firme lande, being greatly amarueiled to sée the infinite number of shippes both great and small that they sawe: some were a fishing, and some vnder sayle, and other some ryding at an anker. The same day about noone there happened vnto them a strange &amp; miraculous thing, and it was, that passing through a straight that was but a quarter of a league of bredth which was betwixt the firme lande and a small Ilande, in the which was continually foure score ships of warre, sette there for watch and warde, they passed thorough the thickest of them and were neuer seene, for if they hadde, without all doubt they had sonke them, or slaine them, their order and commission is so straight giuen them by their generalles of the sea, in the which they are commanded, that whatsoeuer kinde of people of strange nations that they do méete vpon the coast for to kill them or sinke them,

except they do bring licence from some gouernor of such Cities as be vpon the coast, for that such as do meane to haue trafick
                        •
                      doo sende to demande the same, leauing their ships a great way at sea.
                  This lawe for to watch and warde was made and ordayned (as they do say) in respect of the Iapones who did enter into certaine of their portes, dissembling themselues to be Chinos, being apparelled as they were and speaking their language, they did vnto them great and strange hurtes and damages, as is declared in the booke before this. So when they were passed this straight they sayled almost sixe leagues forwardes into a verie fayre and great bay, following other shippes that went before them, for that it seemed that they would enter into some port, and there they might informe themselues where they were, which was the thing that they most desired. When they had sayled about two leagues in this bay they ouertooke one of the thrée shippes and asked of the people that were within her (by the interpreter they had with them) whether they sayled and what lande that was which they sawe before them. Then the principall that was in that ship▪ did put himselfe into his boat, the which hee had at sterne, and came vnto the ship where the Spaniardes were, the better to vnderstande what they did demand, for they before by reason that they were somewhat farre off the one from the other, could not vnderstande the Spaniards demand but by signes. So when that he vnderstoode their request he answered them that it was the country of China, &amp; how that he came laden with salt from the citie of Chincheo, and went to make sale thereof vnto the citie of Canton, which was so nigh hand that they might ariue there before night. But when that hee was entred into the spanish ship &amp; saw the friers &amp; the rest that were in their cōpanie &amp; saw that their apparell &amp; spéech was strange vnto him, he asked of them what they were and from whence they came, &amp; whether they went (and when ye he vnderstood yt they were Castillos, &amp; of the Ilands Philippinas &amp; came frō the said Ilands, &amp; were bound vnto China, with intent to preach the holy gospell) he asked thē whose licence they had, to conduct them vnto the firme lande. But when he vnderstood that they had none, hee asked them howe they passed and escaped the fléete of ships that was in the straight aforesayde.

The Spaniards answered that they found no impediment nor let. So he being greatlie amazed as well of the one as of the other, entred into his owne boate, and with great furie departed from their shippe, and went into his owne, but at his departure the Spaniards did request him, that he would conduct them vnto the cittie, who gaue them to vnderstande by signes that he woulde, although he feared the rigorous punishment that in that kingdome is executed vppon all such as doo bring into the same any man of a strange nation (as hath béene tolde you in the first part of this historie.) So hee fearing that if hée shoulde enter with him into the port, the fault would be imputed vnto him, therefore at such time as hee came within halfe a league of the riuers mouth, he cast about his shippe and sailed to sea, and went so farre that in a short time the Spaniards had lost the sight of them, who when they saw that they had no guide, they followed the course of another shippe that they had discouered before the other did cast about to sea, for which occasion the other two ships that wee spake off before were departed. So a little before the sunne-set they discouered the mouth and entrie of a great and mightie brode riuer, out of the which came two great streames or armes, and in them many ships entering in and going forth, and considering how they had the winde which serued them well, they entered into the same, but when they had sailed forwards a quarter of a league, they discouered so great a multitude of barkes, that it seemed vnto them a groue, or some inhabited place, and as wee drewe nigh vnto them, they not knowing our shippe, all began to flie and run away with so great noise, as though they should haue béene all set on fire or smoke in that place. The Spaniards séeing that they were the occasion of this feare amongst them, they withdrew themselues into the middest of the riuer▪ whereas they strooke saile and came to an anker, &amp; there they did ride all that night, and it was in such a place that none of al the other barks and boates came nigh them by a great way.
                  The next day following which was sunday, the one &amp; twentith day of Iune they weighed anker, and went vnder their foresaile vp that arme of the riuer, the which within a little while they had sailed, did ioine with the other arme aforesaide and was in that place of so great widenesse that it séemed to bée

a sea, there sailed in and out many shippes, barkes and boates of whome the Spaniards demaunded how farre the port was off from that place, but they answered nothing at all, but with great laughter and wonder to sée the Spaniards and their kind of attyre, they departed. But when they had sailed two leagues vp the riuer, they discouered a high towre and very faire vnder the which were at an anker a great number of shippes, thither they sailed right on. So when as they came right ouer against the towre, they saw on shore a great mighty crane to discharge merchandize withall, whereat lay many ships: but when they came to the point, fearing that some ordinance would be shot at them, they strooke all their sailes according vnto the vse &amp; custome in ye ports of Spaine. They after a while that they had remained in that sort, &amp; saw that neither the towre nor ye ships did make any motion towards them, they turned and hoised vp againe their sailes and went wheras al the ships were, &amp; when they came amongst them, they let fall their anker wheras they did ride looking when they would come to demand of them any thing.
               
               
                  CHAP. III. The Friers and their companions came vnto the Cittie of Canton, they went on shore, and praised God for that it had pleased him to let thē see their desire fulfilled. There comes a Iustice to visite them, and hath with them great communication.
                  THe Spaniards séeing that they were there at an anker a good while, &amp; that there was none that came vnto them to demand any questiō, they hoised out their boate, &amp; went in it on shore, wheras they al knéeled downe vpon their knées, and with great deuotion did say Te Deum laudamus, giuing thankes to God for that he had so myraculously brought them into ye kingdome of China, of them so much desired, without any Pilot or other humane industrie: the which being doone, they began to walke along by the crane aforesaid, nigh vnto the which were certaine houses whereas were kept ropes and tackling belonging vnto the shippes: so they procéeded forwards with intent to séeke the gates of the Citie, the which after they had gone the space of foure hargabus shot, they found the gate which was verie

great and sumptuous of a strong and gallant edifice. The people of the country séeing them at their comming a shore how they did knéele downe, and how that their manner of attire was different from the people of the same, &amp; not knowing from whence they did come, did cause in them great admiration, and to ioyne togither a great troope of people, and followed them with great desire to sée the end of their enterprise.
                  This great multitude of people was the occasion that they entred in at the gates of the Cittie, without being discouered of the guards &amp; ports that were put there for that purpose, neither were they disturbed of the entry, by reason of the great throng of people, and strangenesse of the matter. So after they had gone a while in the stréete (the people increasing more and more to sée them) they staied in the porch of a great house, there where as the iustices of the sea, or water bailies do kéepe their courts of audience: and in the meane time that they remained there, which was a pretty while, the guardes of the gate vnderstood that amongst ye presse &amp; throng of the people, did enter certaine strangers contrary to the precept giuen them vpon great penalties: they straightway with great feare that their ouersight should be discouered, ran &amp; laid hands vpon ye Spaniards &amp; carried them backe againe, &amp; put them out of the gate of the citie, without doing any euil or harme vnto their persons, &amp; willed them to stay there in that place till such time as they had giuen ye gouernor of the Cittie to vnderstand thereof, &amp; he to send thē licence that they may enter in againe. So after a good while that they had remained there wheras the guards had set them, there came vnto thē a man, who was a Chino called Canguin, and could speake Portugal: who knowing them to be Christians by their faces &amp; attire, did aske them in the Portingal toong what they sought? ye Spaniards answered him, that their comming into that kingdom was for to shew &amp; declare to them the way to heauen, &amp; to giue thē to vnderstand &amp; know ye true God, the creator of heauen &amp; earth: and that they would very faine talke with the gouernor to intreat therof. This Chino by &amp; by brought to thē a man that could speak very good Portuges, who as after they did vnderstād both he his wife &amp; childrē were christened, and although they were borne in China, yet did they dwel 3. years with Portugals that were inhabited in Machao
                     
which is twenty leagues from that cittie of Canton. This did demande the same question of them that the other did, &amp; wherefore they came into that countrie? they answered him the same as they did the other: hee replied and asked them who was the Pilot that brought them thither? they answered, the will of God, they not knowing howe, nor from whence. But after they had sailed at the sea certaine dayes, they came vnto that place, that according as it was giuen them to vnderstande, is the cittie of Canton, of the which they haue heard declared many straunge thinges: the Chino asked howe the guardes of the sea and shippes that were in the straight aforesaid did let them passe: they answered that they saw no guards, nor any other that did trouble them their passage. This last answere did cause the Christian Chino greatly to admire, who being mooued with a good zeale, said vnto them, that they should returne againe vnto the shippe, and not to come forth vntill such time as he had giuen aduice of their comming vnto the Mandelines of the sea, which be certaine iudges appointed to giue aduice of all such matters to the gouernor, that he may command what is to be done therein.
                  So the Spaniards returned vnto the shippe whereas they remained a good while, and passed great heate, for that it dooth excéede in that port. So after a while they sawe come vnto a house which was néere vnto the gate of the Cittie, a man of great authoritie, who was brought in a litter Chaire, &amp; much people came with him: he stayed at that house, and from thence sent to call vnto him the religious men, and all the rest that came in their company: before them all came one that carried a table all whited, and thereon was written certaine great letters with blacke ynke, the which (as after they vnderstood) was the licence that the gouernor of the cittie gaue them for to come a shoore, without the which there is no stranger permitted. The fathers did straightwayes obey it, and came forth of their shippe with more companie then they desired (of such as came to sée them) who were so many in number, that although the sergeants and officers of the iudge that sent for them, did beate them for to make way, yet was it a good while before they coulde come vnto the house whereas the iudge was, although the way was but short. So when they approched nigh one of

Hee was set in a verie rich Chaire with so great maiestie that they were greatly astonyed to sée it, and the more when that they vnderstood by the christian Chino that he was not the gouernor, neither of the supreme iudges: hee was apparelled in a robe of silke, close from aboue down to the foote, with the sleeues very wide, and a girdle imbossed, and on his head a bonnet full brooches, such as bishops doo vse on their mytres. Before him was set a table, whereon was paper and inke: and on the one side and the other two rankes of men, as though they were to guard him, yet without weapons. They had al of them in their hands long canes of foure fingers brode, with the which (as after they did vnderstand) they do beat su

All these had vppon their heads a manner of helmet made of blacke leather, and on them great plumes of Pecocks feathers, with brooches made of mettal, a thing vsed to be worne in that countrie of such as are executioners or ministers of iustice.
                  The iudge bad the interpreter to aske them of what nation they were, and what they sought in that countrie, and who was their guide to bring them into that port: the which being vnderstoode by the religious men, answered that they were Spaniards, and subiect vnto the king Philip of Spaine, and came thither to preach the holy gospel,Marke the Friers con

And to the last, touching who was their guide vnto that kingdome: they answered, that it was God, vnto whose will all creature are subiect, as vnto the true creator: all the which (as afterward it did appeare) the interpreter did not truely interpret of the interpretation of the Spaniards: vnderstanding that if hee should truely interpret what they saide, the Iudge would forthwith sende them away,

which would be the occasion that he shuld get nothing of them. So that he made his interpretatiō as it best séemed for his purpose, fearing (as after he did confesse) that if he shu

                     e the truth of that which the Spaniards had said, it would haue been verie odious to the Iudge, &amp; afterward both vnto them and to himselfe might be the occasion of some great euill: but to conclude, he answered and told the Iudge that they were certaine religious men who liued in common, a sharpe and asper life, much after the manner of those of that kingdome: and that going from the Iland of Luzon vnto the Ilands of the Illocos, in a great storme and tempest that chanced them, the ship wherin they were was cast away, and al their people cast away, sauing they, who escaped by vsing great diligence▪ and put themselues in that small ship which came in company with another greater shippe, without Pilot or mariner, for that they were almost all drowned, and setting saile in the best manner they could or knewe, being holpen and constrained by necessitie, they let their ship saile, and go whither as fortune did cary them. So after many dangers and stormes at the sea, according to the will of the heauens they came vnto this port, whose name as yet they knew not. The Iudge asked them where they had that Chino that they brought in their company for an interpreter. They answered that he was in Luzon &amp; captiue vnto a Spaniard: they tooke him and set him frée, and hée vnderstanding that they were bound vnto the firme land of China which was his naturall countrie, he requested them to carrie him thither, the which they did with a very good will, for that they had neede of him to vtter their desire, if néede did so require. All the which the other interpreter fearing, that if he should tel vnto ye Iudge how that he was captiue vnto the Christians, hée woulde bée offended, and therefore hee did falsifie the same and saide, that comming vnto an Iland to take in fresh water, they found the boy there, where he was captiue eight yeares before, and came thither forced with a great storme, in the which was drowned a merchants shippe that was bound to Luzon, and he alone escaped by swimming, and so hee came aborde the shippe, in the which were the fathers, not knowing whither they went. All these vntruthes he did inuent for to dissemble and go forwards with his knauish pretence, and would not declare the true intent

of the Friers: the which he had decréed with himselfe how to doo before the Iudge did sende to call them. Moreouer the Iudge did aske them what they brought in their small shippe, they answered that they brought nothing but one chest and two little fardels of bookes, and an ornament for to say masse. This did the interpreter declare truely vnto the Iudge, for that experience might be made thereof. So the Iudge forthwith commanded that it should be brought before him, the which being done, he caused it to be vndone, and he perused euery thing by it selfe, the which being strange vnto him, for that he neuer saw the like: he made signes vnto them that he receiued great contentment in the séeing of thē, but specially of the Images they brought: but that which did best please him, was an Ara or sopre-altar of a blacke stone, the which did shine so bright that they might sée themselues therein, as well as in a glasse. These Friers did bring the same with them out of the kingdome of Mexico, whereas you haue great aboundance, but specially in the prouince of Mechuacan. So after that hee had seene all, and sawe that it was drie, without any signe or token that it had béene in the sea, hée called to remembrance the wordes of the interpreter in the name of the fathers, touching the storme wherein their shippe was cast away, and howe that they escaped by swimming, and put themselues in that small shippe in the which they came: and considering of the same, it séemed vnto him that they did fable in that which they had saide: so that he did replie and asked if it were true that which they had before declared, and howe it shoulde bee that their bookes and other things were not wet at the sea, which was an euident token and plainely to be vnderstood that they had fabled and told lies, and so he beléeued they did in all the rest. The interpreter fearing least by that argumēt his falshod would be discouered, he fel in talke a while wt the Friers, asking &amp; answering things very different to that which ye Iudge had cōmanded him. Thē he wt a strange &amp; sharpe boldnes answered to ye difficulty proponed by ye Iudge, &amp; said, That as all merchants at such time as their shippes are readie to sinke and to be lost, they doo procure first to saue such thinges as are of most estimation, forgetting all the rest: euen so these religious men did procure with great care and diligence to saue those books and that ornament,

which is all their treasure, and yet for all their diligences done they lost a great number mo. All these fables and lies, after many dayes the religious fathers came to haue the knowledge of.
                  The Iudge did aske them if they brought any armor or weapons in their shippe, they answered that they were no men to bring them, neither according vnto their profession they coulde not weare nor vse them, for that they were religious, and professed other matters contrary vnto the vse of armor or weapon, promising and auowing vnto God perpetuall pouertie and chastitie, and vnto their superior prelates obedience all the dayes of their liues. The Iudge returned and asked them if they had any monie, and where withall they did eate and apparell themselues, and bought those bookes and ornaments: they answered, that all that which they had was giuen them by secular Christians for Gods sake, whome they did serue, for that they should pray for them and for the saluation of their soules.
                  The Iudge when he heard this, was greatly astonied for that the interpreter did declare the truth, and made signes that he receiued griefe and had pittie on them, although he gaue not full credite to that which he heard, but said that he would go aborde their shippe to sée if they did say the truth, in not bringing anie armor or weapon, neither siluer nor merchandize. This did hée straightwayes put in vre, and commaunded them that brought him in the litter Chaire, vppon their shoulders to go thitherward: all those people did beare him companie, as also a great number that were there ioyned togither to heare the examination of those strangers, and also the Spaniards he commanded to go next vnto him.
                  So when that he was in their shippe set in his Chaire, his ministers beganne to search the shippe in all places, both aboue and below, and could finde nothing but a little Rice, which was left of tha
                        •
                      which they brought with them: they gaue ye Iudge to vnderstande thereof, who looking vpon the Spaniards, said, that all they that were in the shippe might heare him: these do speake the truth, and they doo seeme vnto me to bee good people, and without any superstition: and without all doubt they doo come and will be after the manner of our religious men, according as is to be séene in the vniformitie of their aprarell, as also

in their heads and beardes. Then he beganne to demaunde of them certaine thinges, more of curiositie then of suspection: who answered him, casting vp their eies vnto heauen (for that their talke was thereof) &amp; they saw that the Iudge did greatly reioyce and had pleasure therein, for that it séemed that they had the heauens for their God, as they haue, by reason they did so much looke vpwards. After this the Iudge came foorth of the shippe, but the religious men remained behind at his commandement with his companions: and likewise hee commaunded certaine of those officers that came with him to remaine about their ship at the waters side, for their guard, more for that none should doo to them any harme, then for any euill suspition they had of them.
                  Al that day that the Spaniards were in their ship, the countrie men came downe to the water side to sée them, and that in so great number, that they did woonder to sée them, and on the other side they greatly reioyced to sée so many soules there ioyned togither, hoping that when it should bee the will and pleasure of GOD, to giue them oportunitie, to baptise them all.
                  The next day following in the morning, they sawe another Mandelin or Iudge comming towards their shippe, accompanied with much people, and with little lesse maiestie then the other had, who entred into their shippe, and commaunded to search both aboue and belowe to sée whether they brought any armour, weapon, or any other kinde of merchandize, and séeing that they coulde finde nothing else but their bookes and their ornament aforesaide, hée commaunded it to bée brought before him, who did peruse the same, péece by péece with great admiration, and shewed great contentment that hee receiued to sée their bookes and Images: although that which did most content him was to sée the Ara of blacke stone, as was said before. Then hee commanded one of the Fathers for to reade in one of the saide bookes, and for to write, the which was done before him with so great facilitie, that the Iudge receiued great contentment to sée it. Then hée asked them if that with the said letters they could write any other language that were different vnto theirs. The Fathers answered yea, that they coulde write any language: and for a plainer proofe, they wrote

on a péece of paper certaine reasons in the Iudges language, the which did cause him greatly to maruell, and said (turning his face to some of them that came with him) these men are not barbarous nor of any euill condition so farre as I can see.
                  With this he departed out of their shippe, and went to giue the gouernour (who sent him) to vnderstand of that he had séene and coulde vnderstande of the Spaniards in this his visitation, who straightwayes did sende them a licence vpon a table, that they shoulde come on shore, and bee suffered to enter into the cittie freely at their will.
               
               
                  CHAP. IIII. The Spaniards go forth of their ship, and go into the Citie, vnto the christened Chinos house, and are carried before another superior Iudge in common audience, and manie other passe with them.
                  SO soone as they had their licence, they went forth of their ship and entred in at the gate of the Cittie, although with great trouble, by reason of the great number of people that came to sée them, as a thing neuer séene before: then they went to the christened Chinos house, hee that serued for their interpreter, who made very much of them, and giuing them to vnderstande that hée had made a true report of all that they had commanded him, and did offer himselfe, to do so much with the Iustices that he would procure to get licence of the gouernor for them to remaine in the countrie, and to giue them a house wherein to remaine and dwel: and did admonish them that at that time they should not deale for to make the Chinos Christians, vntil such time as they were better knowne, and coulde speake the language, and then should they doo it with a great deale more ease. All these promises, with the falsifying of that the Spaniards spake before to the Iudges, was to content the Friers (as in discourse of time they did vnderstande) and onely to get monie from them, for that it séemed vnto him, that it could not be but that they shoulde haue good stoore, for that they came from a rich countrie, whereas it was: and againe to come about businesse

of so great importance, about the which they shoulde remaine there a long time (as aforesaide) as they afterwarde did more at large vnderstande. If that interpreter had declared in fidelitie all that which they had spoken, without al doubt they woulde not haue suffered them to haue come on shoare, else haue put them in some prison, for that they came on lande without licence, and to haue shewed them the most fauour, they woulde haue caused them to returne from whence they came, whereas the guardes of the straight (of whome we haue spoken off before) woulde either in secrete or publike sinke them at the sea, for that they were all greatly in hatred against them: the reason was that the Aytao, who is (as is declared in the first booke of this historie) the president of the counsell of warre▪ and had vnderstanding howe that they passed thorough the fléete and were not séene, which was a thing that they all wondred at.
                  This Aytao did forthwith make secret information of the same, and founde it to bée true, whereuppon hee did Iudge the Captaines to perpetuall prison, where they were well whipped, and did secrest all their goods: for the which all their kin

                     folkes and the rest of the guards had great indignation against the Spaniards, and woulde with great ease haue béene reuenged on them, but that they did feare the punishment that should bee doone on them, after that it shoulde bee knowne. In the which they doo execute their iustice in this kingdome more then in any place in all the world.
                  In the house of this Christened Chino they dined that day as they did many more afterwarde, but euery night they returned to their fregat to bed: for that they durst not leaue their things alone, neither to lie out of their shippe, for that one of the Iudges had so commanded.
               
               
                  CHAP. V. The Spaniards are called before a Iudge, who doth examine them, and offer them great fauour: he dooth write vnto the vizroy, giuing credit vnto the persons, who sendeth commission vnto a Iudge called Aytao, for to examine

their cause: the chiefe captaine of Machao dooth accuse them, in saying that they were spies, and doth intreate of other strange matters.
                  VPon Saint Iohn baptist day they were called before a Iudge, who (as after this did vnderstand) was a superiour vnto the other past: but when they came whereas hee was in place of audience, his ministers did straight wayes commande them to knéele downe at such time as they came in sight of the Iudge, which was vnto the religious men no small torment. Hee demanded of them the same that the others did, and they answered in briefe, that they came to preach the holy Gospell, and requested him to giue them licence to execute the same, and to remaine in that Cittie of Canton for to learne the China tongue, whereby they might giue them to vnderstande and knowe the trueth of the heauen. The interpreter did falsifie their wordes, as hee had doone vnto the other Iudges, and said no more, but for so much that fortune and fowle weather had driuen them into that port, they woulde liue amongst them, although it were to serue them as slaues, for that if they would returne vnto the Ilande of Luzon, or by another name called Manilla, they could not, for that they knewe not the way, neither had they anie Pilot to conduct them.
                  The Iudge had pittie on them, and commanded that such thinges as they had in their shippe should bée brought on land, for that hee woulde sée them: amongst the which, the thing which caused him most to maruell at, was when hée sawe the Images, and Ara (or Alter stone) of blacke Iasper stone (of the which we haue made large mention:) hee requested of the Spaniards that they woulde giue them two Images, which when they had giuen them, they made shew to estéeme greatly of the present, for that they were thinges that they haue not amongst them. He talked with them very friendly, &amp; caused them to arise from the ground whereas they did knéele, and to shewe them the more fauour, he caused to be giuen them to drinke in his presence a certaine beurage which they do vse, made of certaine hearbs, and vse it for a comfortable thing for the heart, &amp; is commonly vsed amongst thē, although they are not dry: and amongst the Chinos is a shew of particular fauour.
                  
                     This Iudge did more vnderstande the intent of the Spaniards then any of the other past, for their interpreter had tolde vnto him that they woulde remaine in the countrie for to cure sicke persons and to bury the dead, the which they could do excellent well. When the Iudge heard these wordes, hee gaue with his hande a great stroke vppon the table that was before him, and said with showes of great wonder vnto other inferior Iudges that were with him: Oh what good people are these as it séemeth: it would be vnto mee a great ioy, if that I coulde of mine owne authoritie accomplish that which they do desire, but our lawes do forbid the same, and that with great rigour. All this did their interpreter tel them afterward. At this time there entred into the place of audience whereas they were, a man of China, one of the common sort, al imbrewed with blood, crying out and making a great noise, without any consort, who prostrating himselfe vpon the ground did complaine of other Chinos with whom he had fallen out, and was beaten and buffeted in cruell sort.
                  The Iudge when he saw him, did straight wayes command his officers to bring the offenders before him,The Chinos most vpright in all their iudgements and in execution of iustice the which was done with a trice, &amp; they returned with the plaintife, bringing thrée other Chinos bound togither by the armes, and as it séemed they were men of base sort. The Iudge incontinent made information wholly of all that passed, and condemned them without writing any letter, in twenty sotes or strokes a peece: the officers forthwith tooke thē with so great cruelty as though they had bin diuels, &amp; threwe them vpon the ground with their bellies downwards to execute the sentence giuen by the Iudge, and when they had pulled off their hose, they began to whippe them vpon the calues of their legges with a sot made of canes, in manner as hath béene told you before. The religious people who were present all this while: and taking pitie on these condemned men, fell downe at the féete of the Iudge, and by signes and tokens did craue of him for the loue of God, that his sentence might not be executed: who straightwayes commanded the executioners to cease, condiscending vnto the petition of the Friers, and did pardon the offenders fiftéene sottes or strokes of the twentie, wherein they were condemned.
                  The Iudge did very much woonder at the pouertie of these

religious men, and at the sharpe and asper apparell that they weare: but the chiefest thing that he did maruell at, was when that he vnderstoode howe they had passed the fleete of ships that were put in the straight for to defende and keepe the coast, and were neuer seene, which séemed vnto him a thing impossible, except it were by permission of the heauen.
                  So when this examination and talke was finished, he commande

                  Within few dayes after they vnderstood that the Iudge had accomplished his promise, for that the vizroy had committed the matter vnto another Iudge called Aytao, whose office is for to examine and inquire the causes of strangers: the wordes of the commission were as followeth.
                  I am written vnto from Canton howe that there are come thither certaine men apparelled very sharpe and asper,The vizroies commission. after the fashion of our religious men in the wildernesse, who bringe no weapons, neither any other thing that might séeme to pretend any euill intent: and for that they are thy charge, examine them with care and diligence, and prouide to doo therein that which shall be most requisite and conuenient: giuing vs to vnderstand the large and true relation of that which shall happen.
                  The verie same day of Saint Iohn, the Spaniards being verie merry and vnmindfull of any thing, for that they had all that day receiued the Sacrament: there came vnto them abord their shippe or frigat the interpreters, and did euidently declare their euill purpose and intent (saying) that it was apparent what they had done for them, and in what perill they did euery day put themselues in for their matters, and that it was reason that they shoulde pay them for the same, and if not, they would not helpe thē any more, neither interpret or take paines in their businesse: certifying them that if they did faile to satisfie them, that they should not finde any that would doo it with

so great good will and diligence (as they should finde by experience) and how that they had béene put in prison if they had not béene, for entring into that kingdome without licence: and for that they enterpreted for them with great curtesie and fauour they had also béene commaunded to returne backe againe from whence they came, which by their meanes, was the cause that the Iudges did intreate them so friendly as they did. The Father Costodio when he vnderstoode their intent, and did euidently see that it was wholly grounded vppon gaine: considering also the vrgent necessitie that they had of them, and not satisfying them, it was difficult to finde any for to helpe them in that their necessitie: of two euils he chose the best, and deliuered vnto them a pawne for their contentment, one of the two Challices they brought with them,A sacred thing no doubt of it. giuing them great charge to vse and kéepe it as a sacred thing, and dedicated for to consecrate the blood of Christ. The principall interpreter did take it with great content, and presently gaue it a newe master in selling it vnto a gold-smith for as much as it was woorth, who did melt it, and made things thereof according to his trade: yet they not being content therewith, and that it séemed vnto them that those fathers could not but bring with them much riches, they inquired of the China boy whom they brought to bee their interpreter, with faire words to know if they had any g
                        •
                     lde or siluer, or pretious stones, or any other thing of valure: but when they vnderstoode that they brought none of those things but onely their bookes and some other ornaments to say masse, they straightwayes imagined in their mindes and that with great care and diligence, to procure some way to get from them the other Challice which they had seene: and the better to put it in execution, they repeated againe vnto the Friers that which before hath beene tolde you, augmenting thereunto many wordes and reasons, affirming that they had spent vpon them in giuing them to eate twelue Taes more then ye Challice which they had giuen them did weigh or amount to, which was twelue ducats of Spaine: hauing before giuen them to vnderstād at such time as they did eate, that they did it of almes and for Gods sake, and with so great content, that many times it happened when they sawe that the Spaniards woulde not eate any dainty thing, but would féede and content themselues

with base victuals) he would say vnto them, that they shoulde eate without any griefe or care, that when it should so fall out that his substance did saile him, hee woulde then pawne one of his sonnes to buy victuals.
                  The father Costodio plainly séeing and vnderstanding that their intent &amp; purpose was wholly groūded for to get from him ye other challice, he answered that he had not for to giue them, &amp; how that he had giuen the other challice in pawn of that which they had spent in victuals, and for their trauell that they had taken for them. The interpreter did replie, saying, that if they had nothing, that they shoulde séeke it, séeing that they ought it for their victuals which they had eaten, and that it was the vse of that countrie, that when any man did owe any thing, &amp; hath not for to pay the same, for to sell their children, or else to become slaues vnto their creditor they demanded the other Challice that remained, for that the other which they had giuen thē did weigh but sixtéene Taes, which was but a small matter in respect of their desert, onely for their trauel in their enterpretations. This Frier Costodio did pacifie them in the best maner hee coulde, promising to pay both the one and the other, hauing oportunitie for the same, and that they woulde procure it with as great care as was possible: and requesting him for to keepe the Challice (that he had giuen him in pawne) in great veneration, for that hee did estéeme it, much more for the consecration and dedication vnto the deuine Colto, then for the value of that it wayed: and more promised him vpon his word to write vnto the Portugals that were in Machao, signifying vnto thē their necessitie, and to demande their almes &amp; charity, and looke whatsoeuer they did send them, being little or much, should bee giuen him. Then the interpreter who had his eyes fixed vppon gaine, saide, that they shoulde forthwith write, and that hee woulde giue him a messenger for to carrie the letter, and to bring answere of the same, as hee had doone the like not many dayes before. The Father Costodio did write vnto the Bishoppe that was in Machao, giuing him to vnderstande of his comming, and of his companions vnto the Cittie of Canton, and howe that his comming thither was onelie to procure for to preach the holy Gospel, and for to conuert and turne to God those blind Idolaters. The which letter being receiued

by the bishop, he made answere, praysing their intent and purpose, animating them with godly wordes of exhortation, and therewith did sende and demand the copie of such authortie as they brought from the holy father touching that the which they pretended. This hee did for that all the sayde countrie vnto the lande of Iapon was committed vnto him by the holy father.
                  Unto this letter the father Costodio answered, that hauing oportunitie he would obey his commandement, and shew vnto him the facultie he brought, and also would him selfe in person go thether for to kisse his handes, and to satisfie all the inhabitants of that towne (for that it was giuen him to vnderstande that they reported euill of them, and sayde that they were vacabondes and lost men, and not true religious men, neither sacerdotes nor priestes, and how that they had requested certaine Chinos, which at that time came vnto Machao, that at their returne againe vnto Canton, they should tell the Iudges and aduertise them with good aduisement, how that there were cer
                     
                        ••
                     ine Castillos come into their Citie, whom they did certainely know not to be of their nation but of an other, and subiectes vnto a different &amp; strange king, whom they did beléeue to come thether for some ill intent and purpose in counterfeit attire, and came for spyes from the Castillos of Luzon, and that they did beléeue that after them did come some armie to do hurt in some part of that countrie, and that they should preuent it in time, for that if so be that any thing should happen, the fault should not be imputed vnto them.
                  All this the Portingales did (as afterwarde they did plainely vnderstande) for feare that the Castillos shoulde take from them their contractation and gaine which they had in that city: by which occasion their intent did so procéede forward, that they did certifie the Chinos, that the chiefe Captaine of Machao (who was put there by the king of Portingall) had presented a petition vnto a Citie that was ioyning to Canton, aduertising the Iudges of that before spoken of, and protesting that i
                        •
                      any harme or damage should come to that country in admitting the Castillos, that it should not be imputed vnto them.
                  But the Iudge vnderstanding their euill intent, and that their accusations were more vppon malice and enuie, then of any trueth, he answered vnto the same, that he was particularly

informed of those religious persons, against whom they did complaine, howe that they were men of whom they néeded not to feare, and without any suspition, as it did plainely appeare when they did visite their ship wherein they came, where they found nothing, but onely a fewe bookes, and some other thinges, which did more signifie deuotion than to make any warre. This Iudge (notwithstanding the answere he made) for that afterwards the chiefe captaine should not raise vp some inuention, tooke the originall petition, and sent it with great securitie vnto ye viceroy of the prouince of Aucheo, that he might sée &amp; peruse it: who when that he had easily perceiued it, and vnderstood the intent of him that presented the same, and the innocencie of them that were therein complained of, he sent &amp; commanded the gouernor of Canton for to giue them good intertainment, and not to permit any harme or hurt to be done vnto thē, &amp; that he should send them vnto the city of Aucheo, for that he would sée them, for that it was tolde him that they seemed to be holy men, and although that they had their apparell in tho same forme, of the Austin friers (whom he had séene) yet their garments were of an other colour and more asper.
                  The chiefe captaine séeing that his intent fell not out well with the Iudges of China, he commanded to bee proclaymed publicke in Machao that none should write vnto them, nor cō
                     municate with them vpon paine of banishment and to pay two thousande ducats. All this was not sufficient for to coole the mindes of some deuout persons of the religion of the glorious saint Francis, but were rather incyted to offer their fauour &amp; helpe, séeing they had néede thereof, but in particular the bishop did helpe them alwaies with his almes, and also an honorable priest called Andres Cotino, who making small account of the proclamation did write vnto them diuerse times, although secretly, and sent their letters with almes, and many exhortations to procéed forward with their holy zeale &amp; intent. Besides this they sent vnto thē a spaniard called Pedro Quintero who had dw

                     lt there many yeares amongest the Portingals, and hauing oportunitie they sent him many times with comfortable things and letters, but not signed, for if happily they should be met with all, they might denie them to be theirs.
                  Now returning to our purpose, the interpreter with desire to

be payd of that which hee saide he had spent and laide out, did bring the messenger that he promised them to go vnto Machao to carrie their letters vnto such religious men as they knewe: in the which he craued their almes and helpe for to pay their interpreter, and praying them for the loue of God to sende them likewise so much as should redéeme their challice (who at this time knew not how it was solde and broken).
                  This messenger went with all diligence and secrecie, and returned with the like, &amp; brought with him that which they sent for, &amp; other iunkets of great cōtent, the which came in very good season, for that one of the sayde friers called frier Sebastian of S. Francis was very sick of a strong ague, wherof in few daies after he died, very wel &amp; with a strange desire to suffer martyrdome for Gods sake. When this messenger came, there was come thither the Aytao who is Iudge of the strangers and was without the citie, vnto whom was cōmited the examination of the Spaniards, who after that he had concluded other matters cōmanded them to be brought afore him with great loue &amp; gen
                     
                        •
                     lenesse, for so the viceroy of Aucheo had commanded him.
               
               
                  CHAP. VI. The Spaniards seing themselues in great necessitie, hauing not to maintaine themselues, they go into the streetes to aske almes, the gouernor vnderstanding thereof cōmandeth to giue them a stipend out of the kings treasure, the interpreter goeth forwardes with his couetousnes &amp; deceit: they be carried before the Iudges of the citie, with whō they do intreat of diuers matters: they do aduise the the viceroy of al, who cōmandeth to send thē to Aucheo.
                  BEcause they would not sée themselues in the like danger with the interpreter, as yt which was past, they would not go any more to eate at his house, but rather to giue an example vnto those of the citie, they went foorth euery day by two and two to aske almes: and although they were infidels, yet they gaue them with great contentment and ioie, because it was a rare thing in that kingdome to sée them begge in the stréetes, by reason (as hath béene tolde you) that they haue no poore folk, neither are they permitted if there be any to aske in ye
                     
streetes nor in their temples. When that the Gouernor vnderstoode thereof, and how that they did it for pure necessitie, and had no other waies to maintaine themselues, hee commanded to be giuen them euerie day a certaine stipend vpon the kinges cost, the which was with so great abundance, that mainteining the souldiers that came with them and all the rest, yet had they to spare, for that their stipende was giuen thē in money, which was sixe Mayesses of siluer, whereof they had to spare, for that all thinges in that countrie is so good cheape, (as hath béen told you in many places.)
                  Their interpreter séeing the good newes that was brought from Machao for the Spaniardes, by a bill that a certayne deuout man had sent him in secret, whereupon would be giuen vnto him all that was néedefull, with protestation to pay all that should be giuen vnto them although it should amount vnto a great summe (with the which hee wrote a letter vnto the Fryer Costodio of great comfort, in strengthening him and all the rest to perseuer in their intent which God had put in their mindes for the saluation of those soules) the Interpreter (I say) beganne to imagine, that for to profite himselfe it was conuenient for to delate and detract the departure of the Spaniardes, and did exact vpon them euery day in the buying of their victuals, the halfe of the money that was giuen them.
                  So vpon a day he came verie much out of order and fayned that the Aytao had commanded that they should foorthwith depart out of the kingdome: but yet notwithstanding he would present a petition in their name, saying, that for as much as time did not serue them to nauigate, neither was their shippe in plight for to make their iourney, that it would please them to get them a house whereas they might remaine thrée or foure monethes, in the which time they might prouide them of all thinges necessarie for their voyage, and possible it may so fall out that in this time, they séeing their manner of liuing to bée good, and to shew good examples they may let them to remaine in the countrie liberally and to learne the language, and then beginne to preach and declare the right way vnto heauen. All this he spake with great dissimulation, for to profite himselfe, for he knewe verie well that the Aytao had willed him to tell them, that they could not remaine in that countrie with the

pretence they had, for that there was a lawe ordayned to the contrarie, without expresse licence from the king, the which will last of all be granted vnto the Spaniardes or Portingals, for that there is a prophesie amongest thē, spoken by the mouth of the diuell, and estéemed amongest them for a very truth, for that other thinges which he spake when that was spoken hath béene verified, in the which he doth pronounce,A prophesie. that a time shall come, that they shall be subiect vnto a nation whose men shall haue great beardes and long noses, and sharpe broade eyes (as we would say cats eyes (in the which they do differ from them. For it is a great maruaile to finde a man amongst them, with more then twentie heares in his beard, little more or lesse, flat noses, and their eyes very little, so that when they will mocke a man, or doo him any iniurie by word, they will call him, cats eyes.
                  Now for that the desire of the Spaniardes was nothing else but to remaine in that countrie, for to bring to effect their good zeale, they did gratifie the interpreter for the great fauour hee shewed them, and did earnestly intreat him for to present the petition, thinking thereby their desire should be vnderstood, and Gods cause iustified, so that they first would enter into them by the way of preaching. He presented the petition when that all the Iudges were together, who had great pitie and compassion ouer the Spaniardes, and willed that they should come before them, for that they would sée and vnderstande the roote and foundation of their will. They obeyed their commandement with great ioy, and when they were come into the hall, one of the Iudges, who was superiour ouer all the rest, and a man of great authoritie, did aske of them by way of the interpreter, what was their pretence in that they did aske a house to dwell in, the Frier Costodio did answere, that he did desire it for to learne the language well, by which meanes they might the better learne them to know the true God, and to set them in the true way to goe and glorie with him, because it was his office and his profession.
                  The Interpreter tolde all this truely, the which fewe times before he had done, as hath béene tolde you. Then the Iudge in name of all the rest, sayde, that in that their demand they could not grant, neyther had they any such authoritie to giue licence.

This being spoken, the Interpreter replyed, without tarrying to heare what the Spaniardes would say, and said, that at least wayes they would giue them licence to remaine there till such time as the Portingals did come thether for to lade their marchandice, which would be within few daies, with whom they would go, for that they were all of one law &amp; faith. The Iudge did againe aske thē if that the Portingals &amp; Spaniards were al one. The father Costodio answered, that in religion &amp; lawes there was no difference, but the one were subiects to one king &amp; the other to another, although they were kinsmen and tha
                        •
                      very nigh. This last petition seemed to the Iudge to be more reasonable and iust than the first, and that they might grant it thē with lesse difficultie, although he answered them and said, that he could not grant it vnto them, but he would write vnto the viceroy for to grant it them. For that the Portugals would bee there at the farthest within foure or fiue moneths, &amp; that in the meane time he would giue them a prouision that they may go fréely abroad, and none to hurt nor harme them.
                  So the next day following which was the second of August he did accomplish his word and promise and sent vnto the viceroy their petition, and therewithall his iudgement and of all the rest that were there with him, what they thought touching that matter. The answere staied many daies after &amp; came not, but in the ende there came a commandement from the viceroy vnto the gouernor of Canton, in the which hee willed that the Spaniards should be sent vnto Aucheo whereas he was, and that there should be carried with them all such thinges as they brought with them, which was their bookes and ornaments. The Iudge did straightwaies send &amp; gaue them to vnderstande of this new order, because they should make themselues readie for to trauaile: the which they did with great ioy and diligence, as you shall vnderstand in the chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. VII. The Spaniardes take their iourney towards Aucheo, &amp; declare what happened in the way thitherwarde.
                  THe next day following, which was the sixtéenth day of August, the Spaniards departed frō 
                     Canton towards Aucheo
                     
to sée the viceroy, with great hope and confidence that he would giue them licence for yt which they pretended. But at their departure they would haue left there two Indians for to kéepe their ship or frigat: but the Iudges that were present, said, that it was not néedefull for them to haue any such care, for that they would take the care vppon them to see all thinges in good order. So presently they sent certaine writing in papers, and commaunded them to bee glewed vppon the hatches of their shippe in such sort that they could not bee open, but they must be perceiued. Then presently was brought for the Spaniardes foure barkes verie gallant and wide with verie fayre galleries and windowes, and beeing imbarked, they charged them verie much to make all haste possible to accomplish the commandement of the viceroy, and sent with them conuenient persons for to be their guides, and to giue them all thinges necessarie for their iourney. They traueiled continually in a mightie riuer against the current, in the which they did sée many thinges woorthie to be noted for the space of foure daies that their iourney indured.
                  There was alongest the riuer side manie Cities and townes verie great, which were so many in number that they could not make any memorie of them, by reason that they passed manie of them by night. To obserue the tides, and to auoid the heate, which was great vppon the water. Alongest the riuer side (whereas it was not inhabited) was full of corne fieldes, whereas they sawe them go to plough with many Bufalos much different vnto the vse of Spaine, for that one alonely buffe did drawe the plough, with one vpon his backe, who did gouerne and guide him with great ease whether hee would they should go, with a corde made fast to a ring at his nose which serued in steede of a bridle.
                  They sawe also flockes of géese, in the which were more then 
                        ••
                     entie thousand, with whom they did weede and tooke away the grasse which did growe amongst the rice, and other graine and seedes, driuing them in the middest of their fieldes, &amp; it seemed that they had the vse of reason, considering how they did separate and make a distinction betwixt the good seede and the bad, and the great care they had to feede and do no harme, neither to plucke vp the good plant, which was a thing that they

wondred at aboue all the rest. All the countrie is verie populous, and the townes one so néere an other, that it may better be sayde, to be all one towne and not manie, and might with more propertie be called the Citie of China, and not the kingdome of China. In all the whole countrie there is not one foot of ground vnoccupied, by reason of the great abundance of peopeople that there is, and they permit amongest them no idle people (as more at large it hath béene declared vnto you) and the countrie beeing fertile, is the occasion that they haue all thinges in great abundance and at a lowe price.
                  Now to returne to their voyage the which they made verie well and with great recreation as well in the townes alongst the riuer side, as vpon the riuer, whereas they were cherished with great care: in the end of foure dayes, which was the twentith day of August, they entred into the suburbes of the Citie of Aucheo, but so late that they were constrayned to remaine there till the next day: whereas they found all thinges necessarie and in good order, aswell for their bedding as for their supper, to passe away the night. The next day very early in the morning he that was their conduct and guide made great haste, for to goe and sée what the viceroy would command.
                  They trauailed through a great and long stréete, which séemed vnto them to be more than a league, and thought that they had gone through the citie. So when they had passed that street they came vnto the gate of the citie, and there they vnderstoode that the rest which they had gone and passed was the suburbes. The mightinesse of this citie, and the great admiration they had, with the multitude of people, &amp; a wonderfull great bridge the which they passed, with many other thinges of the which they made mention, we do let passe, for that it is declared vnto you more at large in the relation giuen by the Augustin friers in the booke before this, at their entrie into the sayd citie.
                  So when they came to the pallace of the viceroy, he was not stirring, neither was the gate open, for as it hath béene tolde you, it is open but once a day. Their guide séeing that it would be somewhat long before that they would open it, he carried the Spaniardes into a court of an other house, which was ioyning vnto that of the viceroy.
                  In the meane while they were there, came all the Iudges to

sit in audience, but when they vnderstoode of the comming of the strangers, they commanded that they should be brought before them: who greatly marueiled at the aspernesse of their apparell, and not at any other thing, for that they had séene there before the Austin fryers. Straightwayes the gate of the pallace was open with great noyse of artilerie and musicall instruments, as trumpets, bagpipes, sackebuttes and hoybukes, with such a noyse that it séemed the whole citie would sincke. At the entrie in the first court, there were many souldiers armed, and had hargubushes and lances, and in a very good order. In an other court more within, which was very great, &amp; railed round about with timber, painted blacke and blew, which a far off séemed to be yron, and was in height a mans stature, there they sawe also many other souldiers, placed in the same order, and in liuerie as the others were, but they séemed to be men of a gallanter disposition. When they came into this court, there was brought vnto them a commandement from the viceroy, in the which they were commanded to returne and come thether againe in the after noone, for that he could not speake with thē before, by reason of certaine businesse he had with the Lords of the counsell, which could not be deferred. With this answere they departed out of the pallace, and returned againe in the after noone, as they were commanded, and into the same court aforesaide, out of ye which they were carried into a mightie great hall, very richly hanged and adorned, at the ende thereof was thrée doores, that in the middest was great, but the other two but small, the which did correspond vnto other thrée doores, that were in an other hall more within, wherein was the viceroy, right ouer against the doore in the middest, in at yt which there is none permitted to enter nor go foorth. Hee was set in a marueilous rich chayre wrought with iuorie and gold, vnder a canopie or cloth of state all of cloth of gold, &amp; in the middest was embrodered the kings armes, which were (as we haue said) cer

                     aine serpents woond in a knot together. He had also before him a table whereon were two candles burning, for yt it was somewhat late, and a standish with paper. Right before the viceroy the wall was verie white, whereon was painted a fearce dragon, who did throwe out fire at his mouth, nose, and eyes, a picture (as was giuen them to vnderstand) that all the Iudges

of that countrie cōmonly hath it painted before their tribunall seates whereas they sit in Iustice, and is there to the intent to signifie vnto the Iustice, the fearcenesse that he should haue sitting in that seat to do Iustice vprightly without feare or respect to any. The order they haue in giuing audience is with the ceremonies in all points as it hath béene shewed you in the relation of the fathers of S. Augustin. All people when they talke with the viceroy are knéeling on their knées, although they be Iudges or Loytias, as the Fryers did sée them many times.
                  This day they séeing that the Spaniardes remained looking alwaies when they should be cōmanded to enter in: the viceroy gaue audience vnto ye scriueners or notaries, to certifie him selfe if they did their offices well, &amp; commanded fiftie of them at that present to be sotted or beaten for that they were found culpable in their detayning of matters, and others the like for that they had receiued gifts &amp; bribes of their clyents▪ the wh

The viceroyes gard were in number more than two thousand men, placed all on a ranke, all apparelled in one liuery of silke, &amp; on their heads helmets of yron very bright &amp; glystering, and euerie one his plume of feathers. These souldiers made a lane from the gate of the hall there whereas the viceroy was, vnto the principal gate of the pallace wheras they did first enter. Those which were in the hals &amp; vpon the staires had swords girt vnto thē &amp; they in the courtes had lances, and betwixt euery one of them a hargubusher. All this gard (as was giuen them to vnderstand) were Tartaros and not Chinos: but the reason wherefore they could not learne, although they did inquire it with diligence.
               
               
                  CHAP. VIII. The Spaniards are brought before the viceroy: he asketh of them certaine questions, and doth remit them vnto the Timpintao his deputie, who receiueth them well, and giueth them good speeches.
                  
                     AT that present came forth a seruant of the viceroyes, a mā of authoritie, and made signe vnto the Spaniards to enter into the hall instructing them that at the first entry they should knéele downe on their knées: the which they did presently, from that place vnto the seat of the viceroy was more thā a hundreth foot in length: yet did the viceroy himself make signes with his hand that one of the religious men should come nearer him, the which the father Costodio did, and knéeled downe againe whē he drew nigh vnto the table that was before him. The viceroy did consider and beholde him a good while, and that with great grauitie &amp; maiestie, and then asked him of whence he was, and what he came to seeke in that kingdome, into the which none might come vpō paine of death, without expresse licence of some of the Iudges alongst the sea coast. The father Costodio answered, that he and the rest of his companions were Spaniards and that they were come into that kingdome, mooued with the zeale of God, for the saluation of their soules, &amp; for to preach the holy gospell, &amp; show thē the way vnto heauen. Hauing declared the interpreter this (although they did not vnderstand whither he did vse fidelitie in the declaration or not, but rather by that, which the viceroydid forthwith demand, it is to be beléeued, that he did it with falshood as he had done many times before) for ye without replying vnto that which he had saide of the preaching of ye gospel, he asked them what marchandice they brought with thē: the said father answered, that they brought none, for yt they were not men that did deale in any marchandice, but in declaring of things appertaining to heauen, &amp; to direct their soules to that place. Hearing this answere (or that which the interpreter would imagine to be better for his purpose) the viceroy did bid them depart, &amp; commanded them to returne againe ye next day and to bring with them their Images, &amp; the other things wherof he was certified from Canton, that were founde in their frigat, for that he would sée it all They did accomplish his cōmandement, &amp; returned the next day in the morning at such time as it was tolde them that the pallace gates would be opened: the which was done in the same maner &amp; order as the day before, with the noyse of musicke and artillerie as aforesaid. So when that the viceroy was giuen to vnderstande how that the Castillos were come, he cōmanded that one of them with alonely

the interpreter should enter there wheras he was, and to bring in such thinges as he had commanded to be brought. the which was presently accomplished. Hee straightwaies began to looke vpon the images euery one by it selfe, and the bookes: &amp; made a stay betwixt euerie one, to consider well thereof, and made a showe of great content he receiued in the sight of thē. Although aboue all the rest, the Ara of blacke Iasper did most content him, and caused a marueilous strangenesse in the rest of the Iudges that had séene it. All this while was the father Costodio vpon his knées, and the interpreter by him, and hee neuer asked of thē any question, neyther did they say any thing. They that did bring those thinges vnto him for to sée them, seemed to be principall and ancient men, who when they gaue it him into his handes they did it knéeling.
                  So after that he had seene them al at his pleasure, he cōmanded to put them againe in the place that they were taken out, and made signe vnto the father Coistodio &amp; to the interpret
                        •
                     r yt they should depart and to carry with thē al those things which they had brought. One of the ancient men that were with him, did go foorth with the Spaniards, &amp; told them when they came into the second hall, that the viceroy did reioyce much to see thē, and all those which they brought, &amp; said that they should repaire vnto ye 
                     Timpintao, who was his deputy, &amp; he would dispatch al such matters as were asked of the viceroy by petition following the same till it was concluded, &amp; that he would consult with the viceroy, who would set down such orders as shold be obserued. They straightwaies did put in execution this order, &amp; cōming vnto the house of the deputie vnto the viceroy, the which was very great &amp; faire, they found that he had a garde very little lesse then yt of the viceroy, &amp; almost with as great maiestie. So after they had remained in the court a good while, abiding his cōmā
                     dement (to whom it was giuen to vnderstand yt the viceroy had sent them vnto him) he cōmanded them to ascend into the place wheras he was, which was into a hall very well dressed, in the which was almost al such things as they had séene in the hall of the viceroy, and he himselfe in the same manner sate in a rich chaire, with a table before him. He cōmanded to take out those things which they brought in their chestes, and did behold them with great consideration péece by péece, as the viceroy had done,

and reioysing much to sée the Images, he did demande of them with curiositie the signification of some of them, but in especiall a crucifixe, that after that he had considered with great attention, he asked what man was that, which was vppon the crosse, and what those letters did signifie that were tituled ouer his head. But when the father Costodio had declared it vnto him, he beganne to laugh thereat, as though he had heard some foolish fable. Hee came and féeled the habites of our religious men, and made signes of great woonder to see the aspernesse thereof.
                  The father Costodio séeing his affabilitie, and as it séemed by outwarde showe that he did very much pitie them, he requested to helpe and fauour him with the viceroy, &amp; that he would aske licence that they might remaine and dwell in that countrie, in any place where his pleasure was to appoint, for yt they were men without any hurt, and would put all their care and diligence to do workes of charitie, and to procure ye men might go to inioy the happie estate to the which they were borne.
                  The interpreter dealt here in his office with as great fidelitie as at other times, in saying that which the fathers did request of him, was that he should be a meanes vnto the viceroy that he would let them to remaine in that countrie two or thrée moneths, for that as thē it was an ill time to nauigate the sea, and that without great danger of their liues they could not returne vnto the Ilands Philippinas. The Iudge answered that they should not feare, but remaine with content, for yt he would procure that there should be giuen thē a house for those thrée or foure moneths, with a commandement that none whatsoeuer should do them any harme. The Interpreter tolde them yt the deputie to the viceroy was very glad yt they would remaine in that countrie, for yt they séemed vnto him men of good example &amp; necessarie in their cōmon weale, &amp; that they might fréely learne the language (as they sayd) for to shew &amp; instruct them the way vnto heauen. The Spaniards hauing heard this, if made them very much to maruaile, &amp; frō that time forwards they had good hope to prosecute that which they did pretend. So with this &amp; with great spirituall &amp; corporal ioy they tooke their leaue of the Iudge, and went vnto their lodging, wheras they gaue thanks vnto God, for the good directing of their busines, &amp; did pray vnto

him to helpe thē, that they might sée a finall conclusion of their desire. All this falsenes that the interpreter did vse, was by the diuine permission (as afterwards they did gather) when that by himselfe they were put out of all doubt, and did declare what he did pretend by the way &amp; order he tooke. For without all doubt, if that the Iudges had plainly vnderstood that they would haue there remained, they would not haue suffered them to haue entred and séene the countrie. And the viceroy being aduertised thereof, would haue caused them to depart in that troublesome wether, whereas possible they should haue béene all drowned, for that the moneths of Iuly, August and September, in that countrie are ordinarily full of stormes and tempestes.
               
               
                  CHAP. IX. The Spaniards remained certaine daies in Aucheo: they go to visite the beautie of that citie, but in especiall the captaine generall of the sea, who was so affectioned vnto the Ara of blacke stone they brought, that hee did with all care and diligence procure it of gift.
                  ALl the time that they remained in Aucheo, they did occupie thēselues in visiting of the principals of yt court, amōgst whom he that did most reioice to see them was the captaine generall of the men of war of that prouince, who after that he had intreated them very friendly and louingly, he desired them that they would returne the next day to visite him, &amp; to bring with them the Ara of blacke stone, which they had shewed vnto the viceroy, that he might sée it, for that he had praised it very much: and to bring also of their painted Images. They did obey his commandement, and came vnto him when that he was at dinner with great maiestie. Then so soone as he had dined he commanded that they should enter into the hal there where he was. The interpreter when he drew nigh vnto him did knéele down, and made signes vnto the Spaniards to follow him and do the like, but the captaine commanded them to arise &amp; to couer their heads, &amp; did very much behold the Ara or (altar stone) making a showe of great admiration to beholde it: hee demanded of the Fryers many things of great curiositie, and asked them if they would sell him that stone, and he would giue them for it what

they would demande. The father Costodio answered saying, that they solde nothing, and much lesse that, for that it was consecrated and dedicated to the diuine colto (or sacrifice.) The Captaine replied and saide, that if they would not sell it, that they should giue it him, and hee would be gratefull vnto them in some other thing, that they should thinke well of.
                  The father Costodio answered that by no maner of meanes he could not do it, for that vpon the same they did celebrate and say masse, at such time as they did sacrifice vnto the true God. At that instant the captaine did put his handes vppon it to féele it, and the father Costodio made signes vnto him to take away his handes, for that he sinned greatly therein. Then he séeing that they would not giue it him, he tooke his leaue, saying, that they should leaue it there with him, for that hee would looke vppon it more at leasure, promising to returne it them againe afterwardes. The father Costodio did consent thereunto, but first he requested him, not to touch it with his handes.
                  So after that he had satisfied himselfe in the beholding of it, his affection was then much more to remaine therewith: and for to accomplish the same, not fayling of his word and promise that he had made, hee deuised with himselfe a certaine slight and policie, and sent for the father Costodio, who came vnto him with great content, thinking verily that he would haue returned their Ara. When he came vnto him, he did intertaine him verie ioyfully and said that he was vpon his iorney to certain warres by the commandement of the king, &amp; that amongst those seruants that he carried with him for his seruice, there were two christened Chinos, which had beene captiues vnto the Portugales of the citie of Machao, from whence they ran away, of whom he had had vnderstanding in all thinges of the ceremonies of the Christians, and that their comming thether was to baptise such as would receiue the same: and hee being fully certified in many thinges touching the same he liked well thereof and gaue great content, and hoped to be one of them that first should receiue the faith when the king should grant licence for the same.
                  All this (as it séemed was that they should let him haue the Ara, vnto the which he was so affectioned, as aforesaid. But

the father Costodio vsed the matter in such sort that hee got it out of his fingers, which was no small matter. Within a few dayes after, the Captaine being readie to imbarke himselfe for to make his iourney, he sent vnto the Spaniardes that two of them should come vnto him, and that they should bring with them the blacke stone, for there were certaine friendes of his that would sée it.
                  The father Costodio did straightwayes accomplish his commandement and carried with him the Ara (or altar stone) for that he durst not do otherwise, yet they did beléeue that in giuing him some pretie or curious thing, they should content him and quiet his mind: they carried also with them the Image of Marie Magdalen made of feathers, which was more woorthie than the Ara, (setting a part the consecration). So whē the religious fathers came wheras he was, he went foorth to méete them more then tenne paces, with signification of great ioy: and carrying them aside, he saide vnto them once againe, that the captiues had told him so many things of their vertuous maner of liuing, &amp; of other things touching the heauen: that he had great affection vnto them, &amp; desired that they might remaine in the countrie for to baptise the inhabitants therof, &amp; that he wold be the first: but the cause wherfore he did delay the time is for to eschew the paines yt is pronounced against all those that do receiue any law or strange ceremonie without particular licence of the king. And for that he went in hast to go &amp; inhabite a certaine prouince, &amp; that he was ready to depart: in ye which so soone as it was possible, he would do so much yt al they should become Christians: &amp; for as much as he tolde him that the blacke stone (vnto the which he was affectioned) was consecrated, that he would let him haue it to carry with him, that he might put it in the first church that the baptised should edifie being made christians: the which would be very shortly, for yt he was determined before many daies to send to Machao for two friers such as were there, to be fully informed of them in thinges touching the Christian faith. Then the father Costodio sayde, if that which he had spoken came from his heart, that hee would foorth with depart and goe with him and all his companie.
                  The Captaine answered that as then hee could not doo it, till such time as the Church was built, and licence had for the

same of the king or vizroy, the which at that time he coulde not demande, for the great hast that he had to depart. The father Costodio replied and said, that his church being built, he would promise him of his worde to sende it him, and not to giue it to any other, and in pledge and token of the same, he should carry with him the Image of Marie Magdalene made of feathers. The captaine receiued the same with great content: greatlie maruelling at the subtill and fine worke, wherewith it was wrought: and after did so much, that almost perforce he remained also with the Ara: and commanded to bee brought foorth two rich péeces of Damaske, and to giue them vnto the Father Costodio for to make an ornament in truck and ful satisfaction for the same: but the father Costodio woulde not receiue them, but was very much gréeued to sée howe that hee did remaine therewith, and with the Image of feathers. The Captaine did contende with him for to take the Damaske, but hée would not.
                  Afterward they vnderstood that that the interpreter was bribed by a seruant of the Captaines, for to alter the friers words and to offer the captayne the Ara, and any thing els that hee would desire. For to the contrary he durst not by any meanes to take it against the will of the fathers. To conclude he did imbarke himselfe vpon his voyage, and caried with him the Ara, and the image with great ioy to himselfe: but vnto the fathers and their companions discomfort and sorrow, for that they had lost the two thinges that they so much estéemed. The captayne at his departure did vse great thinges and curtesie, taking his leaue of them, with signes, that signified he bare them great loue and good will, and that it gréeued him to depart, and could not carie them with him as they requested.
                  The interpreter did comfort the Spaniardes, and sayd that they should not be sorrowfull that the captaine had taken those two pieces, for that he was a mightie prince, and that he would fauour and helpe them with the vizroy, and that hee was certaine that he would accomplish that which he promised, that is to become a christian, for that he did beare great good will and affection vnto them: in the which the interpreter did not lie, for that it was told them by the seruants of the Captaine, that were christened, a I told you before.
                  
                     The Frier Costodio remained so sad and sorowfull for the carrying away of the Ara and Madlin of feathers, as though he had lost a great treasure: and being desirous to recouer them againe, he did recommend the same vnto S. Antonio de Padua, who for thinges that were lost, they knewe by experience to bee the onely saint for aduocate, and did promise (the better to obtaine their desire) for to celebrate vnto him certaine masses, when they should come into place fit for the same.
                  Straightwayes it so fell out that the chiefe and principall interpreter did fall out with the other that did helpe him, about certaine pro
                        •
                     ite that was comming to him, and did threaten him that he would tell the gouernor, howe that they had giuen him much siluer for to conclude the matter about the Ara, for that the fathers had giuen it them more by force then any good will. The interpreter fearing that hee shoulde bée for the same gréeuously punished, and finding himselfe culpable in ye things that the other threatned him for, he went vnto the captain, who was imbarked and readie to depart, tarrying onely for wether, and tolde him the falling out in all points as it passed, and of his threatnings: who likewise fearing what might succéede or happen, if it shoulde come to the vnderstanding of the Aytao of the cittie of Canton, as coulde not be by any meanes excused: hee called vnto him one of his seruants and commanded him to take the Ara and the Image, and to carry them vnto the Fathers, who accomplished his commande, and they receiued them with great comfort, and gaue great thankes vnto God for the same, and S. Antonio de Padua: by whose intercession they beléeued that they were restored.
               
               
                  CHAP. X. The Timpintao dooth call the Spaniards before him, and dispatcheth them for to go to Canton: they tooke their leaue of him, and goeth from Aucheo: and at their comming to Canton, they are commaunded to make themselues readie to depart the kingdome.
                  THe next day following which was the thirde day of September, the Timpintao did sende to call the Spaniards

before him: who as we haue said was deputie vnto the vizroy, and he gaue them certaine dispatches, in saying, that there was in them all that they did aske, and gaue commandement to the gouernor of Canton that he should not neglect, but accomplish al things therin comprehended, so that they might depart when they pleased. When hee tooke his leaue of them, hee did intreate them verie curteously with words of great curtesie. The Spaniards departed his presence with incredible ioy: beléeuing that he had agréed and granted all that they did aske, and to remaine in the countrie to preach, so that the next day following they made all thinges in a redinesse to take their voyage, the which they finished in short time, by reason of their great contentment they had with themselues, as also for the good intertainement and good cheere they had by the way, which was made and giuen them by the commandemēt of the Timpintao.
                  
                  So when they came vnto Canton, they went straightwayes to visite the gouernour, and to giue him the dispatches which they brought, who after that he had read the same, he bad them welcome, and saide that hee was very glad that the vizroy had shewed them so much fauour, and that the same was committed to his charge, for the execution of his commission, that they should perswade themselues that hee would performe it according vnto his commandement, without failing anie thing. And for to beginne the same, hee shewed vnto them a house of the kings which should be for their dwelling, which was in the suburbs halfe fallen downe, and there they were lodged, with a commandement that they should not go foorth, neither enter into the cittie without particular licence. Héere they remained many dayes being deceiued of their purpose, and maruelled very much that the gouernor would not giue them licence for to reedifie a monastery, neither for to enter into the cittie for to giue order in that which they beléeued was granted them by the vizroy, til such time as they vnderstood what was done by their interpreters, &amp; relation giuen by the Chino boy which came wt them from the Philippinas, who declared to thē the truth in all things: how ye the interpreters had neuer told the Iudges how that they would remain in the countrie, neither made any mē
                     tion thereof, but that they came thither as lost men, &amp; that their request was to remaine in the country til it were faire wether,

or the comming of the Portugall shippes. And this was that which the vizroy and his deputie had granted, and no other thing. But when the father Costodio and his companions (who verely beléeuing that their desire woulde take effect) vnderstoode the craft and wile of the interpreters, and the great fashood that they had vsed, they were very sadde, and beganne amongst themselues to remedie the same: so they determined to séeke a new interpreter, one that should faithfulle and truely declare their will vnto the gouernor, And although they did finde some that could doo it, for that they did reasonably vnderstande the Portugall tongue, yet there were none that woulde accept it, for any request or giftes that they did promise them. The Father Costodio séeing this, and that the time appointed did passe away without doing of any thing, one day hee and the rest of his companions did ioine togither, &amp; entred in counsell to sée what was best to be done, according vnto the necessitie in the which they were driuen. There was amongst them diuers opinions, for that of the father Costodio and of another religious man was, that they woulde go vnto Machao, which was not farre off, and there would administer the sacraments, and preach the holy Gospel vnto the christened Chinos and to learne the China language, and to tarrie there and abide the first occasion that should bee offered, or else they themselues to procure it, for hauing the language it were an easie thing to doo it: &amp; they should not haue néede of any interpreter, neither feare to be deceiued as they had béene before. And besides this, they put the Portugals out of all doubt of the false opinion that the Captaine generall had published abroade of them, and of other matters of like effect and purpose. The other two religious men and soulders were of a contrarie opinion: which was, that they should returne vnto the Ilands Philippinas, and not vnto Machao, and saide, that they had departed without licence of the gouernor, and did aduenture themselues into the harme and damage that might happen vnto them by that enterprise, and all for to plant the faith of Christ in that kingdome. And now séeing that by the iust iudgement of God wee cannot put it in execution, wee are greatly bounde to returne againe vnto him, of whome we doubt not but with ease to get our pardon for the error passed, representing the zeale

wee had to the honour of God, and the saluation of so manie soules, who did incite vs to giue that great enterprise: with the which we shall remaine blamelesse with them that had giuen wrong iudgement of vs, and accomplish our bounden duetie and obedience which wee doo owe vnto the gouernor. And in going vnto Machao wée shall runne in great danger to be holden and iudged for traitors to the king: and the intent wherewith wee went vnto China, euery one wil construe and interpret thereon at his pleasure.
                  The resolution of these contrary opinions, was by a common consent delated certaine dayes, in the which they prayed vnto God to put into their hearts, that which was best for his deuine seruice. So in the end the father Costodio, and the religious man, who was of his opinion, did determine to go forwards with their pretence, and to go vnto Machao, as aforesaid, and the rest to returne vnto the Ilands with the first oportunitie they might finde: but when it should come to effect, one of the religious Friers that shoulde haue gone vnto Manilla was deade of an infirmitie that chanced him. They staied there longer then they did think they should, by reason that ye Iudges of the Cittie were occupied with the examinations of students the which is accustomed euery thrée yeares, and is in that manner and order, as hath béene tolde you in the proper chapter for the same: the which examinations endured more then fiue and fortie dayes with great feastes and banquets, without medling in any other particular businesse.
               
               
                  CHAP. XI. The Father Costodio sendeth a messenger vnto Machao he he writeth vnto the bishop and vnto a priest for to bestow their almes on them for their departure. The captaine generall doth vnderstand therof, and commandeth them not to aid nor succour the Spaniards, and other matters appertaining vnto them.
                  IN the meane time of this their examination, the father Costodio did sende a messenger vnto the bishop of Machao, declaring vnto him his determination, and he also did write vnto the deuout priest, of whome we haue made mention before:

and craued of them their almes wherewith they might make prouision for them that would depart for the Ilands Philippinas, and how that he and his companyon would go and see his lordship. This was not done so secretly, but it came vnto the vnderstanding and knowledge of the captaine generall of the Portugals, who with great choller went and demanded the letters of the priest, those that were giuen him by the Chino: threatning him that if hee did not, hee woulde punish him with great rigor, and banish him out of the countrie as a suspected person. He answered him, that of truth he had receiued certaine letters, but that at the very instant hee sent them vnto the Bishoppe vnto whome they were directed: about the which there was great holde and kéepe, vntill it came to effect that the captaine did lay holde vppon the priest for to apprehende him: but when the bishop vnderstood thereof, hee with all spéed possible went to remedy the danger that might insue, and to take him out of his power.
                  The captaine séeing that hee could not perseuer with his intent and purpose, he made many notifications vnto the bishop, requiring that he would not permit that any letters shoulde bée receiued from those religious Spaniards, for that he knew by very certaine relation that they were spies, and no friers, and if so be that any damage should happen vnto them, by their order, that hée woulde lay the whole fault vppon him as a consenter and a helper. The bishoppe answered that he was fully perswaded and certified that they were true religious men, and seruants of God, and that he with a very good will would take vpon him the burthen of any damage that should happen to the country by their meanes, or vnto the king of Portugall. With this the captaine was somewhat quieted, but not so much, but that continually hee did not let to imagine newe matters against the poore fathers, to haue occasion to apprehend them, and imagined in his minde for to write a letter vnto the interpreters, in the which hee did offer them great quantities of mony, if that they would do so much as giue order that the Iudges woulde sende the religious men and Spanish souldiers that were in Canton vnto the Cittie of Machao, aduertising them howe and which way they shoulde vse the matter to put it in effect, and was, that he should tell the Iudges, that the first time

when as they went to speake with the gouernor, whereas they did aske and say that they would depart for the Ilands Philippinas, that they did interpret it contrary, for that their demand was for to go vnto Machao.
                  
                  The interpreters straightwayes (with the desire of gaine) did take the charge vppon them, and did vse the matter in such sort that the Iudges did sende them vnto Machao, whether it were with or against their willes. But God, who woulde not permit those his seruantes and Christians to bee deceiued, remedied the same at such time as it should haue béene put in execution, in the manner as you shall vnderstande in the Chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. XII. A Portugall of the Cittie of Macheo doth discouer the euill intent of the captaine general: he giueth the Spaniards warning thereof by a letter without seale, by the which they remedie the danger that was so nigh at hand: they are called before the Aytao of the Cittie, &amp; he declareth vnto them such matters as haue passed with him, and the licence that was graunted for some of them to go vnto Machao, and the other vnto Luzon.
                  BEing vnderstood by a Portugall a good Christian of the towne of Machao, of such things as the captaine generall did imagine against the poore religious fathers that were in Canton, and their companions the souldiers, of whose holie zeale, he was fully certified, and being gréeued at the very soule that one Christian shoulde hurt and harme another: and more in the disturbing of the saluation of soules, hée determined with himselfe to giue them aduice therof with all spéed that was possible, as in effect hee did by sending them a letter without anie name: wherein he gaue them to vnderstand that the Captaine generall by meanes of the interpreters, did pretende that they should be sent thither wheras he might apprehend them, &amp; send them vnto the king of Portugall, or else to doo some hurt vnto their person, with some false information, and willed them to be wel aduised, &amp; to kéepe themselues from the deceit ordained.
                  
                     The letter being séene, and wel aduised of all that was therein contained: they determined to giue notice thereof vnto a Chino, a verie friende of theirs, and perfite in the Portugall tongue: whome diuers times they prooued by experience, and founde him a very honest man, and one that had doone them friendshippe: who promised them that before many houres, he would bring al things to light, and to know whether that were true or not.
                  So with this desire he went there whereas the Iudge did sit in audience, and was there as one that knew nothing, vntill such time as he saw come thither one of the interpreters with a petition in his hand, and presented it vnto the supreme Iudge, who was the Aytao, the which being read by a scriuener, hée prouided that all things should be granted and doone, that was therein contained. This petition the Chino aforesaid saw, and after that the interpreter was departed with contentment, and found that in the same petition he did request (in the name of the Spaniards) of the Iudge to giue them leaue for to go vnto Machao, which was more for their purpose then to go vnto the Ilands Philippinas, which was granted by the iudge, and lacking nothing but to seale or signe the petition, but was delated vntill the euening, by reason of certaine businesse that chanced at that present: but sure it was the ordinance of God, for that if it had béene signed, they must néeds of force haue accomplished the same, without any replication. So with this certaintie he went straightwayes vnto the Spaniards, to whom the interpreter had told that by petition he had asked licence for them to go to the Ilands Philippinas from whence they came, but the Iudge woulde not graunt vnto that, but for to go vnto Machao, which was néerer hand, who commanded them to accomplish the same without any replication, vppon paine that they should be carried thither perforce.
                  The Spaniards asked councell of the Chino their friende, what meanes might be taken to auoide the danger that the interpreter had begun to bring them in, and was alredie gone to conclude the same. The Chino said that he was fully perswaded that the Aytao loued them well, and that he vnderstood hée did them great fauour and curtesie to graunt vnto the petition the which the interpreter did present in their name. But notwithstanding

for so much as it was not signed, there was remedie to bee had: if that they woulde present another which hee would giue them, and go presently vnto the Aytao and present the same, and say when they giue it him, that they woulde go vnto Luzon and not vnto Machao, and that he himselfe would go with them for the good will he bare vnto them, if it were not for the great paine that is put vppon all them, whosoeuer that shall speak for any stranger, without licence of the Iustice, or is called and ordained for the same. So they being fully perswaded in this conclusion, with the petition made &amp; all ready, there entred in at the gate wheras they were, a seruant to the Aytao, who in the behalfe of his master, came to cal the Spaniards to come before him, for that he would sée and talke with them before their departure. They straightwayes went forth in his cō
                     pany, and came vnto the gates of the cittie, after they had gon a good wayes in the suburbs: and there they were staied till such time as another came and brought their licence, writtē vpon a table (in such sort as in other places it hath béene told you.) So whē they had passed the gate, they passed thorough a long stréet, in the which they saw so great riches, &amp; of so great curiosity, that the father Costodio with great admiration said, I haue béene in the principallest citties of all Flanders and Italie, and in all them I haue not séene so great curiositie and riches, as in this stréete alone: and according vnto the report of them all, hee had great reason to maruell thereat. So they comming vnto the end of this stréete, and in sight of another gate, they sawe that the souldiers which kept and garded the same, did shut them in their presence with great hast, and let fall a percullis of yron before the gate, and demanded to sée their licence at a window out of the saide percullis: and when they had it, although they saw with them the seruant of the Aytao and the interpreter, yet would they not open the gate vntill such time as it was acknowledged and newe firmed by another Iudge, the which being done, they presently did open the gates &amp; did conduct them vnto the house of one which is to be compared to a Iudge of the court, &amp; called in their language Tequisi, that he might go with them to the Aytao, for so it was commanded &amp; ordained. Unto this Tequisi they gaue their petition that they had made, without giuing the interpreter to vnderstand therof, requesting him

by signes &amp; some words which they had learned of the language that he woulde giue it to the Aytao, &amp; to procure that hee might accept &amp; grant that which by ye same they did demand: but whē they gaue it him, it caused great alteration in the interpreter, for that they told the Iudge yt he was a théefe &amp; a traitor, &amp; how that he had sold them to the captaine general of Machao, &amp; how that hee had presented a petition in their name: howe that they would go thither, &amp; not to the Iland of Luzon, where all their desire is to returne, and this hath he done by gifts that the saide captaine general hath promised to giue him, if that he do accomplish his desire. The Tequisi when he heard this, he forthwith departed with vs from his owne house, towards the house of the Aytao which was hard by, and as he went by the way he read their petition, and sawe that it was different to that which the interpreter had giuen before vnto the Aytao, he being present: whereat he made a s
                        •
                     ay &amp; began to consider of the same, as also of that which the Spaniards had said vnto him, at such time as they gaue him their petition, for by the signes and tokens they made, as by their semblant in spéech, it séemed to him, that they were maruellously indigned against the interpreter, but he did not wel vnderstand them, for that they could not plainly declare it in their language, till such time as hee found the contrarietie that was in the petitions &amp; the turbation of ye interpreter, whom presently hee called vnto him, and asked him what the matter was: hee trembling for feare, answered and saide that hée vnderstood that the father Costodio (whome all the rest doo obey as their head, and with whom he alonely did comunicate) that it was his pleasure, and gaue order to go vnto Machao, and that hee was certaine that all the rest were of that opinion, wherein he thought he had done well, and therefore he presented that petition in asking licence, whereby they might doo it liberallie, with this discharge: and againe the Spaniards séeing how he was terrified, and how that he requested them so humblie they would not procéede any farther with their complaint, wherewith the Tequisi was satisfied, who said vnto the Spaniards being in the gallerie of the Aytao his house, that they shoulde tarry there, and hee entred in with the petition in his hand. So within a while after they were commanded to enter into the hall there whereas the Iudges were, and had séene the

petition and comoned about the same. And at their entring into the hall whereas the Aytao was, there were signes made vnto them that they should knéele downe, the which they did almost twenty paces before they came to the table that was before him: hee had in hande the petition that Tequisi had giuen vnto him, and although that he had read it before, yet did he returne and looked againe vppon it, and asked which were they that would go vnto Machao. The father Costodio signified himselfe and frier Iohn Baptista his companion, and said, that they for that they were old and timorous of the sea, they would go thither for that it was nearer hande, and howe that the rest that were not of such yeares, neither so timorous, they woulde returne vnto the Iland of Luzon from whence they came, and there dwell with other of their brethren and friends that were there. The interpreter whose euill conscience did accuse him, for the euils which he had done, was so timorous, that all men might sée plainly his default, and without al doubt the Iustices are so right in executing the same, that if their complaint had gone forwards, they would haue punished him and his companion and that very cruelly: but the religious Friers woulde not consent that the souldiers shoulde declare against them although their will was good, but thought it a sufficient punishment to sée in what affliction the poore men were in, and tooke pittie on them.
                  The Aytao was desirous to sée their Images and book which was the chiefest occasion wherefore hee sent to call them, and when he saw them he receiued great content, and called the Fa-Costodio to come nigh vnto him, and asked the signification of some of them, such as séemed vnto him most strangest, and being satisfied thereof, hee commanded the Frier Costodio to reade on one of these bookes, hée harkening vnto it with great attention, and as one amased to sée those letters, and the forme of them so farre different vnto theirs, which are all in manner of caractes, as hath béene told you. So after that they had passed away the time a while in this, hee saide, that those which woulde go vnto Machao shoulde put themselues on the one side, and they that woulde go vnto Luzon on the other: the which being doone hee tooke his leaue of them verie louinglie, and saide that hee would giue them the licence which

they did aske at all times whensoeuer they woulde, &amp; although hee coulde not grant it them without first to consult with the vizroy of Aucheo, yet he would doo it within tenne dayes, and then those which woulde go vnto Macheo might presently depart, and those which would go vnto Luzo, he would send them vnto Chincheo, that from thence the gouernour shoulde cause them to be sent in the first passage that goeth with merchandice.
                  This Aytao was very peaceable and humaine, who hauing compassion on the Spaniards, for that they séemed vnto him to be good men: he commanded to bee giuen to them ouer &amp; aboue the kings alowance, a Hogge and Rice and other kind of victuals. So here with they went vnto their lodgings with content, and also the interpreter, who thought that hée was new borne againe that day.
               
               
                  CHAP. XIII. The Spaniards remaine certaine dayes in Canton, whither came certaine Portugals from Machao: at the first they feared them, but afterwards they were assured by the contractation they had the one with the other, that they were friendes: the vizroy of Aucheo commeth to Canton, and dispatcheth the Spaniards, &amp; giueth them good prouision and intertainment.
                  AFter that the ten daies were past appointed by the Aytao, and some more, &amp; séeing that no more mention was made of them, but as though they had neuer séene thē, they were very sorowfull, &amp; in ielousie that the captaine general of Machao aforesaide had knowledge howe that his craft and subtiltie was discouered, &amp; thereupon to begin &amp; frame some other: procuring for an instrument in the performing of the same, some Iudge or some other person of power and authoritie. So they being with this care &amp; discontent: there came vnto the cittie of Canton foure Portugals to buy &amp; sell merchandice, with a safe conduct which they had for ye same, which was ye occasion yt their sorow &amp; trouble increased, suspecting what might happen conformable to ye aduise which they had from thence: but for yt they did comon &amp; visit thē many times wt intent to discouer their minds

the one vnto the other, they presently did forget the euill suspection that they had of them, and not onely that, but they did giue them great almes and charitie, helping and aiding them in all things, as it was méete and reason amongst Christians. So being void of their first care, they put all their diligence and care in their departure: and seeing that there was no mention made thereof by reason that the Iudges were occupied in mustering the souldiers of that circuit in a great and mightie field whereas they were trained vp in Military exercises, some shooting in bowes, some with hargabushes, tossing the pike, running of horses, and many other exercises mo: and after that they had many different proofes, as well of thinges past, as at that present, they ordained Captaines, such as were aduanced aboue all the rest, and most worthy: all which being finished, the Spaniards determined to put the Aytao in remembrance of his promise, &amp; the better yt they might doo it, and with most breuitie, they ordained a petition, and went with the same vnto the house of the Aytao, therewith to aske licence to put it in vre. The first Iudge they met withall was the Tequisi aforesaid, who made signes that they should come vnto him, and asked of them what they would haue. The father Costodio answered, nothing but onely to present that petition vnto the Aytao, to put him in minde of their departure, the Tequisi did take the petition, promising them to giue it vnto him presently, the which he did accomplish in a short space. So being read by the Aytao, he made answere by the same petition, that he had a particular care of them, and tarried onely for order from the vizroy, which could not tarrie long: the receiuing whereof hée woulde aduertise them, the which hee did accomplish in fewe dayes, which came with great content vnto the Spaniards, for that he commanded that they should be sent away in verie good order, and to giue them all that was néedfull for their iourney, and that in aboundance. The same day that this commission came, there came also newes that the vizroy would come vnto the cittie of Canton
                     ▪ and that within few dayes hee would bée there: the which did so much trouble the Aytao &amp; the rest of the Iudges, that day &amp; night they neuer rested, but were occupied in the preparing al things necessary to receiue him, which were so many &amp; with so great maiestie as though the king in person

should come thither: with great and mighty triumphall arkes, rich hangings, with other things, the which I do not here make mention of, although they were very curious, because I would not be tedious, for that I haue a great desire to conclude this little historie: and if I should declare all that passed therin, it were requisite for the same alone to make a great volume.
                  Foure dayes after the comming of the vizroy, by his order, there was giuen both to the one &amp; to the other a prouision, in the which he commanded all Iudges and gouernors to receiue the Spaniards into their iurisdictions, whereas they should passe &amp; not to permit any to do them harme or iniury, but to giue them frée passage with securitie till such time as they should come to ye place appointed in ye said prouision, which was vnto Machao &amp; vnto Luzon: and iointly therewith he commanded two captaines to beare them company til such time as they had brought them out of all danger. And to giue vnto them that went vnto Machao (which was thrée daies iourney) sufficient prouision requisite for fiue dayes: and to them that went to Luzon, their prouision for forty dayes, although the voyage is to be made in fifteene dayes, &amp; in twentie dayes at the most. He also commanded them that had the charge to carry them, that they shoulde haue a special care vnto their healthes, in trauelling not too fast but little and little. Likewise the Aytao gaue order vnto the interpreters for to sell the frigat, in the which the fathers came thither, and to giue vnto them the price that shoulde bee made thereof, to bestow it at their pleasure: the whi

                     , which by the commandemēt of the vizroy was giuen them for their iourney, and thought it well bestowed on them, for to sée thēselues free of their lyings &amp; crafts. At the departure of the Father Costodio, one of the souldiers mind was altred, who was called Pedro de Villa roel and was very desirous to go with him vnto Machao, the which h
                        •
                     e did accomplish by apparelling himself in the habite of a Portugal, because he had no licence to go otherwise. So all things being in a redinesse for their iourney, they tooke their leaue the one of the other in shedding many teares with the griefe of minde.
                  The Father Costodio and his companions came safely and in health to Machao in foure dayes, as himselfe did afterwards

write thereof, and were very well receiued of the Bishop, and of all the rest: and within fewe dayes after they gaue them a place for to build a monasterie, wherein he and his companion might liue, and all such as should take the habite of that order. They came thither the fiftéenth of Nouember.
                  And those which went vnto Luzon departed out of the cittie of Canton in a great barke, of the which there are many in all that kingdome, very well tilted and dressed, with many roomes and galeries and painted windowes, as hath béene told you: in the which they were very much made of by the patron of the said barke and of the passengers, which were many, and went vnto diuers partes with merchandice: some thinges that they saw by the way till they came vnto Chincheo shal be told you in the chapter following.
               
               
                  CHAP. XIIII. They that were determined to go vnto Luzon, doo depart for the cittie of Chincheo: in which voyage they see many riuers and townes: and other particular things.
                  THe Spaniards depart out of the riuer of Canton, &amp; after they had sailed by sea ye space of three leagues, they entred into another mighty riuer, in ye which they trauelled four daies. And sure the great number of citties and townes that they saw alongst the riuers side is incredible, and so nigh the one vnto the other, that they séemed to be al one so in the end of foure dayes they landed at one of the cities, where came so much people to sée those strangers, that it séemed al the kingdom were there assembled togither, &amp; were so many in number, that before they could get to ye Inne wheras they should be lodged, there passed more then foure houres, and was in distance but a quarter of a league: but when they came thither they were verie faint with the great thrust a
                        •
                     d throng of the people. They stayed in this Cittie one day, and the next day very early in the morning was brought vnto them horse, for to trauel by land other two daies, ye which was almost continually in villages &amp; townes, &amp; the third day they were imbarked in a small barke, wherein they passed a riuer which had but litle water, ye space of two houres, thē after

they were shipped in a bigger barke, and entred into another riuer, which seemed to be an arme of the sea, in the which they sailed fiue dayes, and sawe sailing vp and downe the said riuer so many barks and boats, that it made them to be greatly amased. These riuers were as wel replenished of cities and townes, as the other riuer whereof we haue spoken. Al which is a helpe to beleeue that which hath béene said of the mightinesse, and the great number of people that are in that mighty kingdom. Concluding this riuer they entred into another, but not so broade as the last, but a swifter current, and beset with mightie trées both on the one side and the other, and were so thick that almost they could not sée the sunne thorough them: and although the country very asper there alongst the riuers side, yet was there many walled citties, &amp; an infinite number of townes and vilages, in such sort that the suburbs did almost ioyne the one vnto the other. So when they were disembarked out of this riuer, they trauelled by land other foure dayes, and greatly maruelled to see the great fertilitie of the country, and many other things more, which they do passe ouer, for that in the relation of ye 
                     Augustine friers it hath béene declared vnto you. In the ende of those foure daies they came to a cittie ten leagues from Chi
                           •
                        
                        cheo, and were lodged in the suburbs of the same, whether resorted so much people to sée them, that although they did shut ye gates to defend themselues from the prease, yet could they not be disturbed of the entry, for yt they broke the gates, &amp; climed vp the wals &amp; windowes to sée them. The host of the house where as they were lodged, when he saw that the people did spoile and distroy his house, he requested the Spaniards to go forth into a greene fielde which was there harde by, placed amongst a company of Orchards, the which they did to satisfie him, &amp; also to satisfie the multitude of people that were come thither only to sée them. The noise of the people was so great, that the gouernor feared there had bin some other matter, &amp; commanded a Iudge to go &amp; examine the cause and know the truth: but when that hee was certified thereof, hee commaunded the Spaniards to come vnto his house, for that hee was desirous and would sée them. They presently did accomplish his commandement, and went their way, and as they passed thorough the stréete, there were certaine representing a comedie, but so soone as

the people that were there did sée the Spaniardes they left the players all alone and followed them. They entred into the gouernors house, and found him with great maiestie of seruants and souldiers of his gard: he entertayned them with great loue, and asked them who they were, and from whence they came. The interpreter presently shewed the prouision they brought from the viceroy, which was in summe, their licence giuen by him for them to go vnto Chincheo, and that none should disturbe them in their iourney. But to ayde and giue them all fauor possible &amp; that which was néedefull for their iourney. And when that he had read the same, he saide that thereby he did vnderstand that which he desired to know, &amp; how that the viceroy did command all gouernors, &amp; him as one of them, they should offer to do all that lay in them: the which he did accomplish and shewed them great fauour and friendship.
                  The dext day following, they departed out of this citie by land, being giuen vnto them by the gouernor, very good prouision for the way. The same day they came vnto a towne that was very fresh, and fiue leagues from the place they departed, there they determined to tarrie all that night, fearing ye passage through a citie which was but a league before, suspecting that they should be as much troubled with the people as they were in the other citie the day before. And although this was but a small towne, yet was there so great a concourse of people that came from the villages there abouts, that it caused them to depart the next morning more early than they thought, and all the night they could not sléepe, because of the great noyse of the people.
                  So within a while after they departed from that towne, they came vnto the citie aforesaide, the which for situation and gallant buildings, was the fairest in all that prouince. Through the midst thereof ranne a mightie riuer, ouer the which were many bridges very great and most faire. Here were they so oppressed with much people that came to sée them, that they were detayned in the presse a good while before they could enter into the citie: and after they were within they were compassed about in such sort, that they could not goe to seeke to eate, but were constrained to enter into a barke and go downe the riuer and shroud themselues amongst a company of trées, &amp; although

they did vse this policie. Yet the number of people were so great that leapt into the same barke that they were readie to sinke, till such time as they that had entred the barke, to auoid that perill, returned and lept a shoore, leauing them all alone with the barkemen and marriners that did rowe, who went to seeke and bring them to eate, and they remained in the barke all that night.
                  So the next day in the morning, before the people could come to disturbe them, they rowed towards the great and huge citie of Chincheo, and entred into the same vppon a sunday in the morning being the sixt day of December.
                  They remained still in the barke for their owne quietnesse and security, and sent their interpreter with their prouision vnto the Gouernour, that he might ordaine at his pleasure that which was therein commanded. The Gouernor when he had receiued commission he said vnto the interpreter that he should tell the Spaniards that he was very glad that they were come thither in safetie and in good health, and that hee should receiue great ioy to sée them, and to shew them the courtesie that was commanded him by the viceroy, in their prouision or commission. But by reason that the great number of people that would come to sée them, should not be troublesome vnto thē, he would passe ouer h

                     s content in séeing them, &amp; for their better cōmoditie they shall depart in the same barke wherein they came, vnto the port of Aytim, wheras were certain ships that were bound vnto Luzon, and that he would command they should be receiued into the said ships, and to be carried with as much spéede as was poss
                        •
                     ble: and for the accomplishing of the same hee kept the commission of the viceroy, and gaue an other commission vnto the gouernor of the port whether as hee sent them, in the which he cōmanded to be accomplished all that he had promised.
                  The Spaniards, although they would very gladly haue séene the citie of Chincheo and the mightinesse thereof, yet did they accomplish that which the gouernor did cōmand without anie reply, for that they considered that it should come then better to passe. So they came vnto the said port the next day folowing in the morning, whereas they did remaine in the barke, doing as they did at Chincheo, &amp; sent their interpreter with the commission vnto the gouernor, who presently after he had read the

same, sent &amp; cōmanded that the Spaniards should come a shore and come and sée him: who did accomplish the same although with no lesse trouble than in other places, by reason of the people that came to sée them. The gouernor intertained them with great loue and faire words, and before they departed from him, he sent to call a captaine of one of the ships yt was there bound vnto Luzon and asked of him when he would depart from that place, who answered within ten daies: then the gouernor commanded that he should carrie them in his ship and to giue them the best intertainment that was possible, who promised him to accomplish the same, &amp; therwith he tooke his leaue of them, and sent them with the said captaine, who offered them all the fauour &amp; friendship that was requisite. He presently carried them vnto his ship, who after he had shewed thē the whole cōmoditie therof, he made thē a colation or banket with great friendship.
                  They remained in this port more than fiftéene daies, wheras they suffered very much colde and séeing that the ship wherein they were appointed to go, was not redie, neither any order for them to depart in many daies, considering the great desire they had to be amongst their owne nation, &amp; to take their ease, and hauing knowledge of an other ship that was ready &amp; would depart, they altogither went vnto the gouernor (who was set in audience) &amp; said vnto him with a loud voice (as is vsed in al that countrie) yt the captaine whom he had cōmanded to carrie them vnto Luzon, was not readie to depart, neither any signe that he would in many daies, &amp; that he would giue them licence and command a captaine of an other ship that was there readie to depart, and went vnto the same Iland of Luzon, that he might carrie thē, because they were so ill at ease, and suffered so much colde that they felt great griefe.
                  When the Gouernor heard this he was very angry, &amp; with great choler he commaunded one of his officers that was there with him, to go presently &amp; bring before him that captaine vnto whom he had cōmitted the carriage of the Spaniards: yt which was accomplished and that in so short time, that it caused great wonder: who when he came before the gouernor, had so great feare, that he knew not whether he was in heauen or in earth. The gouernor straighwaies asked him what was the occasion that he did not depart within the tenne daies as he had sayde.
                  
                     The Captaine answered, that they had had no wether, neither at that present wherewith they might nauigate. He asked him againe and saide, séeing that the weather and time would not serue, how is it that there is an other ship readie to depart. The captaine at this demand did faulter in his spéech, and answered friuolous wordes, wherefore the Gouernor commanded that he should be whipped in his presence, for the lie which he had tolde, and as they were pulling off his apparell for to execute the commandement, the Spaniards hauing pitie &amp; compassion of him, for that he séemed to be an honest man, they fell all vpon their knées at the gouernors féete, and requested him to pardon his offence, who did presently consent therunto with a good will, and commanded to let him alone, but he spake vnto him very sharpe wordes, such as so farre foorth as the Spaniardes could perceiue by the semblance both of the one and of the other, that was as much griefe vnto him as though he had béene whipped. Then presently he commanded to call the captaine of that ship that was readie to depart, and deliuered vnto him the commission that he had giuen vnto the other, with a great penaltie, and charged him to carrie the Spaniards vnto the Ilande of Luzon, and charged him to bring a testimoniall from thence, how that he had carried them in very good order and in saftie and left them at the place that they desired. This Captaine vnderstanding what had passed with the other, and because he would not sée himselfe in the like perplexitie, did accept the commandement, and thought the time long of his departure from thence, and did promise them more than they did demand, and made hast to depart 
                        •
                     ut of the hauen, because hee would not be called backe againe.
               
               
                  CHAP. XV. The Spaniardes depart from China and go to Luzon, they do passe some stormes at the sea: the marriners doo call vpon the diuell, by lots: the religious men do reprehend them: in the end they come to their desired port, whereas they are receiued with much ioy.
                  THe second day of Ianuarie departed out of the port of Aytim with a prosperous wind the shippe wherein was imbarked

the Spaniardes, and two other which were their safe conduct: but by reason it was winter, the faire winde indured but a while, yet came they that day vnto the Ilande of Amoy, which was sixe leagues from the firme lande, and there they stayed one day. The next day following they went to sea, to prosecute their voyage, whereas they were taken with so terrible and foule weather, that the ship did driue they knew not whither, and many times in daunger to be drowned. This storme indured four dayes although more stronger at one time than at an other: in the which storme was separated the thrée ships the one from the other, in such sort that euerie one tooke his way, procuring to saue themselues, as commonly in such cases is vsed, without hauing any care the one of the other, and God was so pleased that the ship wherin the Spaniards were, and one of the other two entred into a sure port, although with great trouble and with so great a leake, that they could scarce kéepe her aboue water: but in especiall that which came in their safe conduct. And afterwarde they vnderstood that the other ship had taken port fiftie leagues from that place with the like perill and danger. In this port they remained certaine dayes trimming their ships and tarrying for a faire winde. So they departed from thence the thrée and twentie day of Ianuarie and to their iudgementes with a setled and good winde, with the which they sayled fiue dayes, in the end wherof they discouered the Iland of Luzon, with a singular ioy vnto them all, for the which the Spaniards gaue thankes vnto God, by whose fauour they had escaped the storme past.
                  But it so fell out, as they were going alongest the coast of the Iland for to enter into the port of Manilla, and being within fiue leagues of the entrie thereof, vpon a soddaine there arose the north wind with so great furie, and caused so great a sea, that they found themselues in a great deale more danger than in the other storme past, in such sort that they sponed before the winde with their foresayle halfe mast hie, shaking it selfe all to péeces, and in euerie minute of an houre readie to be drowned. The Chinos for that they are superstitious and witches, beganne to inuocate and call vpon the diuell, for to bring them out of that trouble (which is a thing commonly vsed amongest them, at all times when they finde themselues in the like perplexitie)

also they doo request of him to showe them what they should doo to bring themselues out of trouble.
                  But when the Spaniards vnderstoode their dealinges, they did disturbe them that they shoulde not perseuer in their lottes and inuocations, and beganne to coniure the diuelles, which was the occasion that they would not answere vnto the inuocation of the Chinos, who did call them after diuerse manners (as hath béene declared in the first part of this historie) yet they heard a diuell saye, that they should not blame them because they did not answere vnto their demaunde, for they could not doo it for that they were disturbed by the coniuration of those sp
                        •
                     nish Fathers which they carried with them in their shippe.
                  So presently when the night was come God was so pleased that the storme ceased, and became in fewe houres very calme, although it indured but a while, for as they beganne to set sayle to nauigate towardes the port, and almost at the point to enter into the same a newe storme seised on them, and with so great force, that they were constrayned to returne vnto the sea, for feare to be broken in péeces vpon the shore.
                  At this time they wanted both water and victualles which was vnto them a newe torment, &amp; they were brought into so great extremitie, that for ninetie and sixe persons that were in the shippe, there was not left victuals for two dayes.
                  The Chinos beganne a newe to inuocate the diuels by writing, which is a way that they neuer let but doo answere them, as they did at this instant, and were not disturbed by the coniurations of the fathers, yet notwithstanding they lyed in their answere, for that they saide that within thrée dayes they should be within the citie of Manilla, and after it was more then four dayes.
                  In conclusion hauing by the fauour of almightie God ouercome all their trauayles by the sea, and the necessitie of the lacke of water and victualles, they ariued at the desired port the second day of Februarie Anno 1580. whereas they were receiued by the gouernour and of all the rest with great ioy, in pardoning them the offence they had committed in going without licence, and showed vnto them particular fauours, &amp; were very sorrowfull that the father Costodio and his companions

remained in Machao, for that hee was welbeloued of all, and that with great desert, for his vnderstanding, learning, &amp; holy life. Who within fewe dayes after did write a letter vnto the rest of the religious men in Manilla aduertising them how that in a short time they came vnto Machao in good health, &amp; how that the bishoppe and the Captaine generall with all the rest of the towne were verie glad and ioyfull of their comming, and fully resolued to the contrarie of the false opinion that they had conceiued of them, and that he was in g

                     ters touching the faith. Also he wrote, that he vnderstood by good originall or information (although it was cōmitted in secret) that the kingdom or prouince of Cochin China, which is four daies iourney from Machao, whereas the Portingals hath contraction, and port for all their ships that come from the Indias, hath sent vnto the bishop of Machao, &amp; doth demand of him priests for to baptise them, with such determination &amp; good will to be christians, that in some portes they haue alreadie timber cut downe for to edifie churches. This you may beléeue for that the bishop himselfe hath tolde him, and in the latter end of his letter was written as foloweth. They haue inuited me to this enterprise, and (for to put my selfe therein) I would gladly haue with me many companions, which is the treasure that we go to séeke. It is a firme lande, there whereas God hath prepared a great haruest. Th

and gaue vs all that was néedefull, and also did suffer vs to preach, if we could the language: the which with the fauour of God we will quickly learne, for that we are whereas continually we doo common and talke with the Chinos, wee doo verie earnestly commit it vnto our Lord to direct and guide the same, that his holy name may bee exalted, and the soules of these blinde Gentiles may knowe and beléeue, and beléeuing may be saued.
                  This was the substance of the letter, with the which it séemeth vnto vnto me great reason to conclude this second relation. And to begin the third, the which I do beléeue will be pleasant to the reader, and is intituled, A Commentarie of the new world, in the which is contayned many curious matters, as you shall perceiue after the reading thereof, and is declared in substance and effect by the relation of the father, that did passe and sée them all, who was named fryer Martin Ignacio, a religious man of the order of S. Francis, who after that he had compassed the whole worlde, came hither to Rome with Martin Simion bishop of the Iland of Pepper in the orientall or east Indias, with whom I haue had communication diuers times, and is a Chalde borne, and of the citie of Niniuie in Babylon, and made bishop by the patriarke of Babylon.

                   are at this day called by the Spaniards ye 
                  Canarias, which is deriued of Canes or dogs, for that there was in them at such time as the Spaniardes did discouer them, great quantitie of dogges, very bigge fierce and braue. There are of them seuen

Ilands which are called Gran Canaria, Tenerife, Palma, Gomera, Yerro, Lancarote, and Forte Ventura, and are in altitude twentie eight degrees,The names of the Canarias. lacking very little, and haue in them many particular thinges, of which I will declare some of them in briefe.
               In the Iland of Tenerife, at the farther part therof towards the north west, there is a mountain called El Pico de Tereyra, which vnto the iudgement of thē who haue séene it, is the highest in all the worlde, and is plainely seene before you come to it thrée score leagues: so that a ship going from Spaine vnto those Ilandes doth discouer that mountaine first. None can ascende or go vp that mountaine but in the moneths of Iuly &amp; August, for that all other moneths of the yeare there is very much snow on it,Much snow. although in all those Ilandes it doth neuer snowe, and to mount the height thereof is three daies worke, on the top of the same there is a round &amp; plaine place, and being thereon at such tune as it is faire weather and the seas calme and in quiet, you may sée all the seuen Ilands, and euerie one of them will séeme but a small thing in respect, yet some of them are distant from that more than fiftie leagues, &amp; it hath as much more in cōpasse as that. In the two monethes aforesaid they do gather in the toppe thereof all the brimstone that is brought from that Iland vnto Spaine which is much in quantitie.Great quantitie of brimstone. This mountaine belongeth to the duke of Maqueda by particular gift of the king.
               In one of these seuē Ilands aforesaid, called the Hierco there is a continuall woonder, which in my iudgement is one of the greatest in all the worlde, and worthie to be knowen amongest all mē, wherby they may exalt the mightie prouidence of God, and giue him thankes for the same. This Iland being the greatest amongest the seuen, is a countrie very asper and vnfruitfull and so drie,Thedropping from a tree doth seruethe whole Iland with water. that there is no water to be found in all the Iland, but on the sea side, and that in fewe places, but very farre distant from the inhabitance of that Ilande. But there naturall necessitie is remedied by the diuine prouidence of heauen (as aforesaide) and by a strange meanes, which is, there is a great and mightie trée (vnknowen, and the like hath not beene seene in any part of all the whole world) whose leaues are narrowe and long, and are continually gréene like Iuie, vpon the which trée is séene continually a small cloud, which neuer augmenteth

nor diminisheth, with the occasion that the leaues continually without ceasing, doth distill drops of water, very cleere and fine, which doth fall into certaine ses
                     •
                  ernes, which the inhabitantes of the townes haue made for the conseruation thereof, to remedie their necessities, and to sustaine thereby not onely themselues, but also their cattell and beastes, and is sufficient for them all: yet doo they not knowe the originall and beginning of this continuall and strange miracle.
               One hundreth leagues distant from these Ilandes towards the right hand, there is an other thing of little lesse admiration then the other yt we haue spoken of, which is: that many times there is séen an Iland, which they cal S. Borandon. Many being lost at the sea haue chaunced vpon the same Iland, &amp; do say that it is a very fresh and gallant Iland, with great abundance of trées and sustinence, &amp; inhabited with Christian people, yet can they not say of what nation or language. The Spaniards many times haue gone with intent to séeke it, but neuer could finde it,Opinions of this Iland. which is ye occasion that there be diuers opinions touching the same. Some doo say that it is an inchanted Iland, and is seene but certaine daies assigned or appointed: &amp; others say that there is no other let or impediment for the finding therof, but because it is so little, and is continually couered with great cloudes, &amp; that there runneth from it riuers which haue so great a current that it maketh it difficult to come vnto it. My opinion is (if it be any thing worth) yt being true, that which so many haue spoken of this Iland according vnto the common opinion which they haue in all the seuen Ilands of Canaria, it can not be without some great mysterie: for he which can cause it to be all in a cloud, &amp; the swift current of the riuers to be an impediment to the finding therof, can find remedie for the inhabitants to come forth (if it be so for them yt be without at the sea not to go into it) yet can it not be, for thē within the Iland, but at some time there should haue some come soorth by chance, and haue bin séene of some there abouts, &amp; declared vnto thē ye secret of ye mysterie: frō whence I do gather, that either this Iland is imagined or inchaunted, or else there is in it other some great mysterie, for the which to giue credite vnto it, or to varie from the truth, it shal be wisedome not to proceed any further, but to conclude in yt which toucheth ye Ilandes of Canarias aforesaid▪
               
               
                  The clyme and temperature of them all is excellent good, and hath abundance of al necessary sustenance for mans life. There is gathered in them verie much wheate, and other séedes, and wine: there is also made verie much sugar: there is nourished and brought vp great store of cattell and that verie good. But in especiall Camelles,Camelles. whereof there is great store. Also all kinde of sustenance is better cheape there then in Spaine.
               All these Ilandes are inhabited with Spaniardes whereas they doo liue verie pleasantly, amongest whome, at this day, there be some that be naturall of the Guanchas aforesaid, who be verie much Spaniarde like. The principall of all these seuen Ilandes is the Gran Canaria, in the which is a bishoppe and a Cathedrall Church, and counsell of the inquisition and royall audience, from the which dependeth the gouernement of all the other sixe Ilands.

                  r that the fléetes or shippes had taken refreshing in the Ilandes of Canarias aforesayde, they departed from thence sayling by the same Rutter, vntill they come vnto an Ilande called the Desseada which is fiftéene degrées from the Equinoctiall,The Iland called Desseada.
                   eyght hundreth and thirtie leagues from the Canarias: all which is sayled without séeing any other land, they are sayling of the same ordinarily eight and twentie and thirtie dayes.
               This Iland Desseado, was called by that name, by reason that the gul
                     •
                  e is great, and so many daies sayling, that when they do sée it, is that after that they haue verie much desired the same (so that Desseado is as much to say, as desired. This Iland hath nigh &amp; about it many other Ilandes, one of the which is that which is called La Dominica,
                  The Iland Dominica.
                   which is peopled and inhabited by certaine Indians who are called Caribes, by such as do nauigate that way, which are a kind of people that doo eate humaine flesh: they are very expert archers, &amp; very cruell: they do annoint their arrowes with a deadly earth, &amp; so ful of poison,

that the wound the which is made therewith can not be healed by any humaine remedie. This Ilande is in fiftéene degrées. It is verie little and not of much people, yet notwithstanding it hath béene the death of many Spaniardes both men and women: such as haue come thither in shippes, not knowing the daunger thereof, haue gone a shore for fresh water, or else to wash their lynnen, and vppon a soddaine vn looked for, haue béene be set by the Indios, who haue slaine them, and after eaten them: and they say that it is very sweete flesh and sauorie, so that it be not of a Fryer, for of fryers by no meanes they will eate, nor would not after that happened vnto them as hereafter followeth.
               There was a ship that was bound vnto the firme land, and did arriue at that Ilande, in the which went two religious Fryers of the order of Saint Francis, and hauing no care as aforesayde, but very desirous to be a lande, they went a shore without any feare or suspition of any harme that might happen vnto them, and being at a riuer side sporting themselues with great recreation, by reason of the freshnesse thereof, easing themselues of the long and painefull nauigation which they had comming from the Ilandes of the Canarias vnto that place, when the Caribes did sée them without any feare, vpon a soddaine they descended from a mountayne, and did kill them all, without leauing any person aliue. Many dayes they made great feastes and bankets, eating of those bodies which they had slaine, some sodde and some roasted, as their pleasure was. So on a day they would amongest them eate one of the fathers, who was very faire and white,They which did eatefriers flesh did die madde. but all that did eate of him in a little space did swell marueilously, and did die madde, with great gaspings that it was woonderfull to sée: so that from that time, they remaine as warned neuer for to eate any more of the like flesh.
               Of these euils they haue committed an infinite number, and haue at this day with them many Spaniardes both men and women, whose liues they pardoned for to serue their vses, or euilles because they were verie young, of the which they say that some haue fled away. They go naked like vnto the Indians, and doo speake their language, and are almost conuerted vnto their nature. This great inconuenience might

be remedied, if that it did please his maiestie to command some generall that were bound vnto the firme land, or vnto the new Spaine, to make abode there a fewe dayes, and to roote 
                     •
                  ut and make cleane that Ilande of so euill &amp; wicked people which were a good déede, and they doo well deserue it, and to giue libertie vnto the poore Christians that are there captiue a great companie of them. And it is saide of a truth that some of them be of good calling. There can none goe a lande on this Ilande but straightwayes they are discouered by such ordinarie spyes as they doo put to watch. And if they do sée that those which doo come a land are many in number, and that they can not hurt them, they doo remaine in the highest part of the mountayne, or else amongest the thickest of woods and bushes, till such time as the shippes do depart, which is so soone as they haue taken fresh water or fire wood. They are great traytors, and when they sée oportunitie they giue the assalt, in the manner as hath béene tolde you, and doo very much harme.
               Nigh vnto this Ilande Dominica towardes the northwest is the Ilande of S. Iohn de Puerto rico the which is in eightéene degrées: it is fortie and sixe leagues long and fiue &amp; twentie leagues brode, and in compasse about an hundred and fiftie leagues.Much kine, sugar, &amp; ginger: wheat and gold. There is in it great store of kyne, verie much sugar, and ginger, and yéeldeth very much wheate. It is a lande of verie much golde, and is not laboured nor taken out of the earth for lacke of people, it hath verie good hauens and portes towardes the south, and towardes the north onely one, the which is sure and good, in respect whereof the Spaniardes did giue the name vnto the whole Ilande, Puerto rico, taking the name of the port or hauen. In it there is foure townes of Spaniardes, a bishoppe and a cathedrall church, and he that is prelat at this day, is the reuerend father don fryer Diego de Salamanca of the order of S. Austin.
               When the Spaniardes went first vnto this Ilande, according vnto ye report of the reuerende father de Las Casas bishop of Chiapa,
                  Of sixe hundred thousand Indians there remaineth none was in the yeare 1509. This Iland was so full of trées and fruite that they gaue it the name of the Guertas, and there were in it sixe hundreth thousande Indios of the which at this day there remaineth not one.
               From this Ilande vnto the Ilande of Santo Domingo,
                  
is foure score leagues, I say from one port vnto an other and from poynt to point but twelue leagues. They doo ordinarilie go from one port to an other in thrée dayes, but to returne they are more than a moneth, for because the winde is contrarie.
            
            
               CHAP. III. Of the Iland of Santo Domingo called Hispaniola and of their properties.
               THe Iland Hispaniola,
                  The Iland Hispaniola or Santo Domingo.
                   which by an other name is called Santo domingo by reason that it was discouered as that day, it is in eightéene degrées, and was the first that was discouered in the Indias, by the captaine Christopher Colon, worthie of immortall memorie, it was inhabited in the yeare of 1492. This Iland is in compasse more than sixe hundreth leagues, it is diuided into fiue kingdomes, the one of thē is now called the Vega, which at the time that it was discouered was called Neagua, it hath foure score leagues in compasse, and stretcheth all of them from the north vnto the south out of the which sea, as doth testifie the reuerende of Ciapa in his booke, doth enter onely into the kingdome,Mightie riuers in spain. thirtie thousand riuers and running brookes, twelue of them as great, as Ebro, Duero, &amp; Guadalquiuir in Spaine. The foresaide bishop doth also speake of an other maruaile, which is, that the most part of these riuers, those which do distil and run from the mountaines which is towardes the west, are very rich of gold, and some of it very fine, as is that which is takē out of the mynes of Cibao, which is very well knowen in that kingdome, &amp; also in spaine, by reason of the great perfectiō therof: out of ye which myne ha
                     •
                  h béene taken out a péece of virgin golde so bigge as a twopennie wheaten loafe,A peece of virgin gold so bigge as a two pennie wheaten loaf. and did weigh three thousand and sixe hundred Castillianos, the which was sonke and lost in the sea, in carrying of it into Spaine, as doth testifie the aforesaid reuerend bishop. In this Ilande there is greater quantitie of cattell than in the other Iland of Puerto rico, &amp; there is made much sugar,
                     Cannafistola.
                   and gathered much ginger, and Cannafistula and also manie sortes of fruits, such as is in Spaine, as others different of the countrie, &amp; that in abundance: there are also great store of hogs

whose fleshe is as holesome and as sauorie as is mutton in Spaine, and is verie good cheape: a heyfor is bought for eight ryalles of plate, and all other thinges of that countrie after the rate, although that the marchandice of Spaine is verie deere. It is a countrie of verie much golde, if there were people for to take it out:Gold and pearles. and manie pearles. In all this Ilande they gather no wheate, but in the bishopricke of Palensuela, although in many other places the ground would yéeld it very well, if they would sowe it. But nature, which was woont to supplie necessities, dooth accomplish the lacke of wheate to giue them in stéede thereof a roote, which dooth growe in that Ilande in great quantitie &amp; abundance, and dooth serue them for bread, as it did vnto the naturall people of that countrie,Bread of a roote called Casaue.
                   when the Spaniards went thither. It is white, and is called Casaue, the which being grinded &amp; brought into meale they doo make bread thereof for their sustinence, the which although it is not so good as that which is made of wheat meale, yet may they passe therwith and sustaine themselues.
               This countrie is verie hoat, by reason whereof their victuals are of small substance. The principall citie of that Ilande is called Santo Domingo, (for the reason abouesaid) in the which is an arch-bishop &amp; a royall audience, or chauncerie: this Citie is built on the sea side, and hath to it a great riuer, the which dooth serue them for their port or hauen
                     •
                  , and is verie secure. There is in it thrée monasteries of religious friers and two of Nunnes.
               In this Ilande (as saith the reuerende bishop of Chiapa in his booke) there were whē as the Spaniards came first thether thrée millions of men naturall Indians, of the which at this day there is not two hundred left,Of three millions of men not two hundred left. and yet the most part of them be sonnes vnto Spaniardes, and blacke mores borne of the Indians women. All their sugar milles and other places are inhabited with negros, of the which there may be in that Ilande about twelue thousand. It is a holsome countrie vnto thē that dwell therein. The sea is ful of whales, and that in abundance, which are séene by such as do come in their ships, &amp; many times they are in feare of them. But aboue all other there is an infinit nūber of great fishes called Tiburones,
                  
                     Tiburones.
                   &amp; are in great skule: they are marueilously affected vnto humaine flesh, &amp; wil folow

a shippe fiue hundred leagues, without leauing of it one day. Many times they haue taken of the fishes and do finde in their bellies all such filth as hath béene throwne out of their shippe in many dayes sailing, and whole shéepes heads with hornes and all: If they chance to finde a man in the waters side he wil eate him all: if not, all that he doth fasten on, he doth sheare it cleane away, be it a legge or an arme, or half his body, as many times it hath béene séene, and they doo it very quickly, for that they haue many rowes of téeth in their heads, which be as sharpe as Rasers.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. Of the way and the Ilandes that are betwixt this Iland of Santo Domingo, and the kingdome of Mexico.
               THe first Ilande that is after you are departed from Santo Domingo, is that which ordinarily is called Nauala,
                  The Ilande of Nauala. the which is one hundred and twelue leagues from ye cittie of Santo domingo, and is seuentéene degrees, and is but a small Iland:The Iland of Iamayca and nigh vnto that is another which is called Iamayca of fiftie leagues in Longitude, and fourtéene in Latitude: there was wont to be about them many Vracanes,
                  Uracans. which are spowts of water, with many blustering winds. This word Vracan in the Indian tongue of those Ilands, is as much to say, as the ioyning of all the foure principall winds togither, the one forcing against the other: the which ordinarily dooth blow vppon this coste, in the monethes of August, September and October, by reason whereof such fléetes as are bound vnto the Indies doo procure to passe that coast, before these thrée monethes or after, for that by experience they haue lost many ships in those times. From this Iland they go vnto the Ilande of Cuba,
                  The Iland of Cuba, an
                        •
                      the port Hauana,
                   which is in twenty degrées, in the which is the port of Hauana, which is called the Cape of San Anton: they doo put two hundreth and fiue and twenty leagues of Longitude, and of Latitude sixe and thirty, it is inhabited with Spaniards, who conuerted all the rest vnto the faith of Christ: there is in it a bishop, and monasteries of religious Friers.
               When that any ships do go vnto Noua Espania, they haue sight of them, &amp; likewise when they do returne, all those which

do come from the Peru do enter into the foresaid port of the Hauana, which is a very good port and sure, and there is to be had all kind of prouision necessary and belonging vnto the fleetes and ships, some which the Ilande dooth yéeld it selfe, and other some brought from other places: but in particular, there is great store of very good timber, as wel for the repairing of ships as for other thinges, with the which they do ordinarily balest their ships that come for Spaine. The kinges maiesty hath in this a gouernor and a captaine with very good souldiers for the defence therof, and of a fort which is in the same harbor, the best that is in all the Ilands.
               This Iland of Cuba was discouered in the yeare 1511. and was in it (being of the bignesse aforesaid) a great number of naturall people, and now but a very fewe: it hath a riuer wherein is very much gold, according vnto the opinion of the natural people, and was tolde by the fathers vnto their children, the which was cast into that riuer by the natural people in this order following.
               There was a Casique called Hatuey, who for feare that hée had of the Spaniards, came from the Iland Hispaniola, vnto this Iland with many of his people, and brought al their riches with much golde amongst them, who by the relation of other Indians of Santo Domingo (wheras he had béen king) vnderstood that the Spanyardes were comming vnto that Iland, whereupon he gathered togither all his people and many of that Iland, and made a parley vnto them, saying: It is said of a certeintie, that the Christians doo come into this Iland, and you doo well vnderstand by experience, what they haue done by the people of the kingdome of Aytim (which was the Iland Hispaniola) the like will they doo here by vs, but doo you know wherfore they doo it: they answered and saide, because they were of their owne nature cruel. The Casique saide no, that they did it not therefore,The Spani

                     old. but because they had a God whom they did worship, &amp; because they will haue him from vs, they doo kil vs: and in saying these words he tooke forth a basket with golde &amp; iewels which he brought thither in secret, and shewed it vnto thē saying, this is their God that I spake off, let vs make vnto them Ateytos, the which are sports and dances, and possible we shall please them, &amp; then wil they command their people not to do vs

any harme. For ye accomplishing &amp; furnishing of the same, euery one of them brought that which they had in their houses, &amp; made therof a great mountaine of wheate, and danced rounde about the same till they were werie: then the Casique saide,The Indians throwe all their gold and iewels into the riuer I haue thought with my self whilest we were dancing, that howsoeuer it be, these that do come wil kil vs: for whether we do kéep our treasure or giue it vnto them, with couetousnes to séeke more from vs we shall die: therefore let vs throw it into this riuer, the which they did with a common consent and good will.
               From thir point or cape of Sant Anton,
                  The port of saint Iohn de Lua.
                   they saile to the port of San Iuan de Lua which is on the firme land of Mexico, two hundreth and thirtie leagues from the said point: in all that bay there is great fishing, but in especial of one kind of fish which is called Mero, the which are so easie to be taken, that in one day they may lade not shippes but whole fléetes, and many times it happeneth that they bring so many to their ships that that they throw them again into the sea, for lack of salt to salt them with.The Iland of Campeche
                   They passe in sight of an Iland called Campeche the which is a gallant &amp; fresh country, &amp; nigh vnto the kingdom of Mexico: in it is great store of victuals, but specially hony and waxe,Hony &amp; wax

There is in it a bishop and a cathedrall Church, a gouernor for his maiestie, and monasteries of Friers. Within few dayes after they depart from this Ilande and come vnto the port of saint Iohn de Lua, in the which by reason that it hath many flats, it is requisite to be carefull for to enter into it: his maiestie hath in it a fort which is good and strong. Fiue leagues from this port is the Cittie of the Vera Cruz whereas is the whole trade &amp; traficke,The Citie of Vera Cruz,
                   and there is resident the kings officers: it is a hot country by reason that it is in ninetéene degrées, but well replenished of all kinde of victuals: it was wont to be vnholesome, but now they say it is not so much, they know not what shoulde bee the occasion, whether it bee by the moouings of the heauens, or by the good gouernement and discretion of them that do dwel in it. This cittie is from the citie of Mexico, ye which is metropolitā of al that kingdom and by whom al the rest is gouerned, seuentie leagues, al ye way inhabited &amp; ful of townes both of Indians Spaniards, &amp; so great store of prouision yt it seemeth to be ye land

of promission. It is mauellous temperate, in such sort that almost throughout al the whole yeare, it is neither whot nor cold neither dooth night excéede the day, nor the day the night, but a very little, by reason that it is almost vnder the Equinoctiall line. The mightinesse of this kingdome, and some particularities, you shall vnderstand of in the Chapter following.
            
            
               CHAP. V. Of the bignesse of the kingdome of Mexico, and of some particular and notable things that are in it.
               
                  The kingdome of Mexico.
                  THis kingdome of Mexico is the firme land: on the one side it hath the North sea, and on the other side the South sea: it is not possible to declare the bredth and length thereof, for that vnto this day it is not all discouered. Euery day they doo finde and discouer new countries, as in the yeare of fourescore and thrée you may perceiue by the entry which was made by Antonio de Espeio, who with his companions did discouer a countrie, in the which they found fiftéene prouinces, al ful of townes which were full of houses of foure and fiue stories high, the which they did name Nueuo Mexico, for that it doth resemble the old Mexico in many thinges.New Mexico
                   It is towards the North, and they do beleeue that that way, by inhabited place, they may come vnto that country which is called of the Labrador (of which shal be spoken more at large hereafter.)
               This kingdome towards the Orient dooth ioyne vnto the country of Peru,
                  
                     
                        Peru. Nombre de Dios. Acapulo. Panama.
                     
                     The straites of Magellanes.
                     
                   and so running by the North sea, and reacheth vnto Nombre de Dios, which is a port of the saide kingdome, and from thence vnto Acapulco, which is a port in the kingdome of Mexico: and in the South sea it reacheth vnto Panama, a port of the said Peru, and in the same sea it extendeth nigh vnto the straights of Magellanes, and not farre from the riuer of Plata and Brasill.
               To conclude, this kingdome is so great that vnto this day they cannot find the end therof: but euery day doth discouer new countries, whereas all the Indians that they do finde are verie easie to bee reduced vnto the Catholike faith, for that they are people very docible, ingenious, and of a good vnderstanding. There is amongst them diuers languages, and verie different

climes, although all generally doo vnderstande the Mexican tongue, which is most common. There are many prouinces inhabited by Indians and Spaniards, that euery one of them is as bigge as a reasonable kingdome, yet the greatest and most principall is that of Mexico, whereas are many Indians and Spaniards which doo excéed all the rest in number: the names of them are Honduras, Guatimala, Campeche, Chiapa, Guaiaca, Mechuacan, Nueua galicia, Nueua Viscaya, Guadiana and others mo, which I leaue out because I woulde not be tedious: in all the which, they haue either a royall audience and gouernors, or other Iustices all Spaniards.
               The naturall people whereof, neuer since they were conuerted haue béene found in any heresie, nor in any thing contrarie vnto the Romish faith. All these prouinces are subiect and doo acknowledge that of Mexico as the principall: there whereas his maiestie hath his vizroy, an inquisition, an archbishop and a royall audience or court of Chancerie.
               This Cittie of Mexico is one of the best that is in all the whole world, and is situated vpon water after the manner and fashion of Uenice in Italie: in all this kingdome almost you cannot know when it is winter, or when it is summer, for that in al the whole yeare, there is smal difference betwixt the daies and the nights, by reason of the temperature of the countrie, the fieldes are gréene almost all the whole yeare, and trées beare fruit also almost all the whole yeare: for when it is winter in Europa, then doo their fall dewes from heauen which dooth cause all things to budde and flowre, and in the summer it doth ordinarily raine, but especially in the monethes of Iune, Iuly,It rayneth almost euery day. August and September in the which monethes it is a maruel when it raineth not euery day, and it is to bee wondred at, for that almost it neuer rayneth but from noone forwards, and neuer passeth midnight, so that it neuer troubleth them that doo trauell by the way, for that they may beginne their iourney at midnight, and trauell vntill the next day at noone. It raineth vnreasonably and with so great furie and force, that the time that it dooth indure, it is requisite to flie from the showers, for that many times they are so hurtfull that one sole shower taketh away the life of a man.
               Almost all the whole yeare in this kingdome they do sowe

and gather as wel whea
                     •
                  e (wherof they haue great abundance) as Maiz, which is the ordinary sustentation of al the Indians, blacke moores &amp; horse,The best horses in all the world. of the which they haue great abundance very gallant &amp; good, both to ye eye, &amp; indéed, as in any kingdom in al the whole world that is knowne vnto this day. The brood of them was carried out of Spaine thither, when first they did discouer that country, &amp; for that effect were chosen the best that could bee found: and for that they doo eate all the whole yeare greene grasse &amp; Maiz, which is wheat of ye Indians, is the occasion that they do deserue to haue the praise aboue all other. In fine, this kingdome is one of ye fertilest of victuals of al that euer we haue heard off, and of riches, for that there is in it an infinite number of siluer mines,An infinite number of siluer mines. out of the which is taken great abundance, as it is to be séene euery yeare when as the shippes doo come vnto Syuell. It is vnder the Torrida Zona, yet notwithstanding it is of the temperature as I haue said, contrarie vnto the opinion of ancient Philosophers, who said that it was not inhabited. But now to excuse them, it shal not be from our purpose to declare the cause wherefore they were deceiued, and is, that in the foure monethes aforesaide, wherein the sunne hath his most force, it doth continually rayne, which is the occasion that the country is so temperate: and besides this, God doth prouide that it is visited with fresh windes, which come both out from the South and North sea, and is so ordinarie a thing, that it is a maruell to see it calme, by reason whereof the whole kingdome is of that propertie, and although the sunne be very strong and causeth great heate: yet putting himselfe vnder any shadowe, although it bee but little, they straightwayes feele a fresh and comfortable winde, by reason of the temperature of the heauen in the manner aforesaid.
               The inhabitants of this kingdome throughout al the whole yeare, néede not to augment nor diminish their apparell, neither their beddes. Also the aire and clime is so holesome, that you may lie and sléepe in the fieldes without any thing vppon you, as in any house be it neuer so well hanged and close.
               All that is discouered of this kingdome (except it be the lande of the Chichimecos, which is a kind of Indians that liueth as the Alarbes do in Africa without any house or towne) all the rest I say are in peace and quietnes baptised and doctrined, and

furnished with many monasteries of diuers orders of religious men, as of the order of S. Dominicke, of S. Francis of S. Austen, &amp; of Iesuits, besides a great number of priests that are reparted in al parts of that kingdome, so that the one and the other are continually occupied in doctrining of the naturall people and other Spaniards that are in that kingdome, of whome, although they be but a few in respect of the Indians, yet do they surmount in number more then fiftie thousand.

                   which is that of Mexico as aforesaid, there is a vniuersitie, and in it be many schooles, whereas is red any facultie, as is in Salamanca, &amp; that by men of great sufficiencie, whose trauel is gratified with great rentes &amp; honor. There bee also in it many great hospitals as well of Spaniards as of Indians, wheras the sicke men are cured with great charitie &amp; comfort, for that euery one of them haue great rents and reuenues. I do not intreat of the Churches and monasteries both of Friers and Nunnes which are in that cittie, nor of other particular thinges, for that thereof there is written a large historie, and my intent is to declare by way of a comentary that which the said father Costodio &amp; Frier Martin Ignacio did comon with me by word of mouth, and that I saw written and vnderstood of him at his returne from trauelling almost the whole world, and of other things that I my selfe haue experimented in certaine parts of it: so that this my discourse may more properly be called an Epitome or Itinerario then a historie. In this kingdome there are bred and brought vp more cattell then in any other parts knowne in all the world, as wel for the good climate and temperature of the heauen, as also for the fertility of the country. The kine and shéepe many times bring foorth twise a yeare, and the goates ordinarily thrise a yeare: so that because they haue many fields in that countrie, and much people that doo giue themselues vnto that kinde of g
                     •
                  ttings (as grasiers) is the occasion that there is so great abundance, and solde for a small price, and manie times it happeneth that the bringers vp of them doo kill tenne thousand head of them onely to profite themselues with the skinnes, in sending of them into Spaine, and leaue the flesh in the fieldes to féede the foules of the ayre, without making any more account thereof.
               
                  There is great aboundance of many sorts of fruites, some of them very different from those which are gathered in our Europa, &amp; the most part of them: but amongst all notable things which are to be considered off in that kingdome (which are manie) one of them is a plant called Mag
                        •
                     ey, and an ordinarie thing in all those prouinces &amp; townes, of the which they make so many things for the seruice and vtilitie of them that do dwel therin,A strange kind of tree. that it is hard to be beléeued of them that haue not séene it (although in al places you haue many witnesses to it). They take out of this plant wine, which is that which the Indians doo drinke ordinarily, and the Negros: also excellent good vineger, honie, a kinde of thride or yarne, wherewith they doo make mantels to apparel the naturals, and for to sow the same apparell: the leafe haue certaine pricks whereof they do make needels wherewith they sow their apparel, their shooes and slippers. The leaues of that plaint ouer and aboue that, they are medicinal, they do serue to couer there in the place of tyles, and being dipped in the water, they make thereof a certaine thing like hempe which serueth for many thinges, and make thereof repasse, and the trunke of this plant is so bigge and strong, that it serueth for ioystes and beames whereon they doo build their houses, which commonly is couered with strawe, or else with brode leaues of trées, as is that of this plant. All this although it séemeth much, yet in respect it is nothing considering ye great profite that is made of this plant, as shalbe declared vnto you, when we come to intreat of the Ilands Philippinas, where as there is great aboundance of them, as I refer it vnto the iudgment of the reader.
            
            
               CHAP. VI. This Chapter doth prosecute in the things of the kingdom of Mexico.
               THe Indians of this kingdome are maruellous ingenious and doo sée nothing but they imitate the same,Properties of the Indians. whereof commeth that they are very good singers and plaiers vpon all sorts of instruments, yet their voices doo heale them nothing. They are very much affectioned vnto matters touching ceremonies of the Church, and giuen vnto the deuine culto, and therein

they doo very much excéede the Spaniards. In euery towne there are singers appointed, which repaire euery day vnto the Church to celebrate the offices vnto our Lady, the which they do with great consort and deuotion. Touching the dressing and adorning of a church with flowers and other curiosities, they are maruellous politike: they are reasonable good painters in some places: they make images of the feathers of small birdes which they call in their language Cinsones, which haue no féete, and féede of nothing else, but of the dewe that falleth from heauen, and is a thing greatly to be séene, and was wont in Spaine to cause great admiration, but in especiall vnto such as were famous painters,Pictures made of fethers. to sée with what curiositie and subtiltie they did make their pictures, in applying euery colour of the feathers in his place. They are people of great charitie, but in especiall vnto the Ecclesiasticals: which is the occasion that one of them may trauell from sea to sea (which is more then fiue hundred leagues) without the spending of one riall of plate in victuals, or in any other thing, for that the naturals doo giue it them with great good will and affection, for the which in all their common places of resort, which is an Inne for strangers: they haue men appointed for to prouide for all Ecclesiastical men that doo trauel, of all that they haue néede, and likewise vnto the common people for their money. They doo not onely receiue great content with them, but they themselues doo go and request them to come vnto their townes, at the entrie whereof they make them great entertainement: they go all foorth of the towne both small and great in procession, and manie times more then halfe a league, with the sounde of trumpets, flutes and hoybuckes. The principallest amongst them go forth with bowes and nosegayes in their hands, of the which they doo make a present vnto such religious as they doo receiue: and sometimes they cast them more flowers then they woulde willingly they shoulde. Generally, they doo reuerence all Ecclesiasticals, but in particular, those of such religious houses, which in that kingdome were the first that did conuert them, and baptise them, &amp; they do it in such sort, that if the religious man will for any offence punish or whippe any of them, they do it with such facilitie, as a master of a schoole doth beate his schollers that he doth learne.
               
                  This great reuerence and subiection, was planted amongst them by the worthy captaine Hernando Cortes,
                  
                     Hernando Cortes.
                   marques del Valle, hee who in the name of the Emperor Charles the fift of famous memorie, did get and made conquest of that mightie kingdome. He who amongst other vertues that be spoken of him (and doo indure vnto this day in the memory of the naturall people of that countrie, &amp; as I do beléeue his soule is mounted many degrées in glory for the same) hee had one that surmounted the other in excellency, which was, that he had great reuerence and respect vnto priestes, but in especial vnto religious men, &amp; his will was that the same should bée vsed amongst the Indians: at all times when hee did talke with any religious person, he did it with so great humilitie and respect, as the seruant vnto his master. If he did at any time méete with any of them in the stréete, he being on foote, a good space before hée came vnto them, hée woulde put off his cappe, and when hee came vnto them hee would kisse their handes: and if hee were on horsebacke, hee had the like preuention, and woulde alight and doo the like. By whose example, the naturall people of that countrie doo remaine with the same custome, and is obserued and kept in all that countrie vnto this day, and with so great deuotion, that in what towne so euer that any Ecclesiasticall, or religious man doth enter, the first that doth sée them before they enter therein, doo runne vnto the Church and ring the bell, which is a token knowne amongst them all, that a religious man is comming, so that foorthwith all the women go forth into the stréete whereas they do passe, with their children in their armes, and bringe them before the religious men, that they should blesse them, although he be on horseback, and do passe a long thorow the towne.
               In all this countrie there is great aboundance of victuals and fruit, that the mony being of so small estimation (by reason they haue so much) a ryall of plate is no more woorth there then a Quartillo in Spaine: you shall buy there a verie 
                     ••
                  ire heafor for twelue rials of plate, and fiftie thousand if you will at the same price, and a calfe for sixe or eight rials of plate, a whole shéepe for foure rials, and two hennes, such as you haue in Spaine for one riall, and of Ginny hennes, otherwise called Turkey cockes, and in Spanish Pauos, you shall haue

an hundred thousande (if you please) for a riall and a halfe of plate a péece, and after this rate all other sortes of victuals whatsoeuer you will buy, although they be neuer so good: wine and oyle is very deare, for that it is brought out of Spaine, not for that the countrie will not yéeld thereof, and that in great aboundance (as hath béene séene by experience, but they wil not consent to it for diuers respectes.Medicinall hearbes. There be thorough out all the whole kingdome many hearbes that are medicinall, and the Indians very much experimented in them, and do always cure with them, in such sort that almost there is no infirmitie but they haue a remedy for the same, and do minister it, by reason whereof they do liue very healthfull, and do die verie seldome, but of leanenes, or when the radicall moistnesse is consumed. They vse little lettings of bloode,They vse no compounds. and lesse of compounded purgations, for that they haue amongst them other simples which they bring out of the fielde, wherewith they do euacuate their humors, applying them vnto the pacient. They bee for little trauell, and doo passe with little meate, and verie seldome sléepe but on a matte vpon the ground, but the most part in the fields in the open aire, which as wee haue saide hurteth not, neither themselues nor yet the Spaniards. But now to speake in few words that which requireth a great discourse &amp; many words, and yet notwithstanding not expresse well that which might be said of this mightie kingdome: I will conclude in comparing it vnto the most greatest and richest of all that is now knowne in all the world, except that of China, of the which in this historie hath béene mentioned so many thinges, and shall be more spoken off, when as we shall come to intreate of it, for that wée will intreat of the new Mexico, as I haue promised in the fift Chapter, and because it is a new thing, I do beléeue it wil be of great content.
            
            
               CHAP. VII. Of the new Mexico, and the discouering thereof, and what they do know of it.
               IN the said Chapter I said that in the yeare 1583. there was discouered fifteene prouinces,New Mexico
                   the which the discouerers therof doo call the newe Mexico vppon the firme lande of Nueua

Espania, and I did promise to giue notice of the discouering thereof, the which I will do with as much breuitie as is possible, for that if I shoulde difusely declare all that they did see and knowe, it were requisite to make of it a newe historie: the substance thereof is, that in the yeare of our Lord 1581 hauing notice there of a religious man, of the order of saint Francis, who was called Frier Austen Ruyz, who dwelt in the valley of saint Bartholmew, by the relation of certaine Indians called Conchos, who did communicate with others their neighbors called Pasaguates, who said that towards the parts of the North (trauelling continually by lande) there were certaine Ilandes very great, and neuer knowne nor discouered by the Spaniards, who being remoued with great zeale of chariti
                     •
                  , for the saluation of those soules, did aske licence of the Counte of Corunnia, Uizroy of the saide Nueua Espania, and of his owne superious for to go togither, and to procure to learne their language: and knowing it necessarie to baptise and preach vnto them the holie Euangelist, hauing obtained the licence of the aforesaide persons, taking with him other two companions of the same order, with eight other souldiers, who of their owne good wil would beare them company, he departed to put in execution his Christian zeale and intent: who after a few dayes that they had trauelled, they came into a prouince which was called of ye 
                  Tiguas, distant from the mines of saint Bartholmew (from whence they began their iourney) two hundred and fiftie leagues towardes the North,The prouince of Tiguas
                   in the which by a certaine occasion the naturall people thereof did kill one of the Friers companions: who, as also the souldiers that went with him, séeing and perceiuing the successe, and likewise fearing that thereof might happen some other greater danger, they determined with a common consent to returne vnto the mines from whence they departed, with consideration, that the company which went with him were very fewe to make resistance against such successes as might happen, being so farre distant from the dwellings of the Spaniards, and from their necessarie succour. The two religious men which remained did not onely refuse their determination, but rather séeing good occasion to put their good desire in execution, and so much ripe Mies, or dainties for the Lordes table, and

séeing they could not perswade ye souldiers to procéed forwards in the discouering thereof: they alone remained in the said prouince with their Indian boyes, and a Mestizo that they carried with them, thinking that although they did remaine alone, yet were they there in securitie, by reason of the great affabilitie and loue wherewith the naturall people did intreat them.
               So when the eight souldiers came vnto the place that they desired, they straight wayes sent the newes of al that happened vnto the Cittie of Mexico, vnto the vizroy, which is distant from the mines of Saint Barbora one hundred and thrée score leagues. But the Friers of S. Francis were very much agréeued, for the remaining there of their brethren, and fearing least they should be slaine for that they were there alone, they began to moue the hearts &amp; minds of other souldiers, that were in the company of another religious Frier of that order, called Frier Bernardino Beltran, for to returne to the said prouince, to deliuer the aforesaide two religious men out of danger, and from thence to prosecute &amp; go forwards with their enterprise begun.
               At this time there were at the said mines by a certaine occasion, an inhabitant of the Cittie of Mexico called Antonio de Espeio, a very rich man of great courage and industrie, and verie zealous in the seruice of the maiestie of king Philip: hée was naturally borne of Cordoua, who when that he vnderstood the great desire of the saide Friers, and howe much it did import, did offer himselfe to go on that iournay, and to spend theron part of his substance, besides the venturing of his life. So licence being granted vnto him to prosecute the same by some that did represent the kings person, and was procured by the saide Friers, there was appointed and giuen him for captaine Iohn de Ontiueros (who was chiefe bayley for his maiestie, in the townes which are called the foure Cienegas which are in the gouernement of the new Biscay, seuenty leagues from the aforesaid mines of S. Barbora) and he to go with him, and gather togither men and souldiers, such as he could, for to accompany him, and helpe to follow their Christian intent.
               The said Antonio de Espeio was so earnest in this matter, that in a few dayes he had ioyned togither souldiers, and made prouision necessarie for the iourney, and spent therein a great part of his substance, and departed altogether from the valley

of saint Bartholmew the tenth of Nouember 1582. and carry with him (for whatsoeuer should happen) one hundred and fiftéene horses and mutes, great stoare of weapons and munition, with victuals and certaine people of seruice in this iourney necessarie. He directed his iourney towards the North, and at two dayes iourney they came whereas were a great companie of Indians,The prouince of Conchas.
                   of those which be called Conchos: they were in raches and in houses made of straw, who when they vnderstoode of their comming, by relation of long time before, they went forth and entertained them with shewes of great ioy. The feeding of these people &amp; of al the rest of that prouince,Great store of Conies, Hares and venison. the which is great, is of Conyes 
                     •
                  lesh, Hares &amp; venison, of ye which they haue great aboundance. They haue great store of Maiz, which is wheat of the Indians, pompines &amp; mellons very good and in aboundance. They haue many riuers full of fish very good and of diuers sorts: they go almost al naked, and the weapons that they doo vse, are bowes and arrowes, and liue vnder the gouernement and lorship of Caciques, as they of Mexico: they found no Idols amongst them, neither could they vnderstande that they did worship any thing, for the which they did easilie consent that the Spaniards should set vp crosses, and were very well content therewith, after that that they were informed by the Spaniards the signification thereof, the which was done by interpreters that they carried with them, &amp; by whose meanes they vnderstood of other inhabitances, whether as ye said Conchos did conduct thē, &amp; did beare thē company more then foure and twenty leagues: all which way was inhabited with people of their owne nation, and in al places whereas they came, they were receiued with peace, by aduice that was giuen by the Caciques from one towne to another. So hauing passed the foure and twenty leagues aforesaide, they came vnto another nation of Indians called Passaguates,
                  
                     Passaguates.
                   who liue after the manner and fashion of the other aforesaid Conchos their borderers, who did vnto them as the others did, conducting them forwarde other foure dayes iourney, with aduice of the Caciques as afore. The Spaniards found in this iourney many mines of siluer (according to the iudgement of them that vnderstand that faculty) &amp; of very rich mettall.Mines of siluer. One iourney from this they came to another nation called the Tobosos,
                  
                     Tobosos
                   who when they discouered the

Spaniards, they fled vnto the mountaines &amp; left their townes &amp; houses void: but more after they vnderstood, yt certain yeares past, there came vnto that place certaine souldiers for to seeke mines, &amp; carried with them captiue certaine of the natural people of that country, for which occasion they remaine as scared &amp; feareful. The captain forthwith gaue order, that they should be called backe again, with assurance that there should be no hurt done to them, &amp; did so much that many of thē returned▪ of whom they made much on▪ and gaue them giftes, declaring vnto them by the interpreter, that they came not thither to do hurt to any, with the which they all returned and were in quiet, and consented that they should set vp crosses, and declare the mysterie of them, and they made shew that they were content therewith, and did accompany them, as the other their borderers did, vntil they had brought them into the inhabitance of another differēt nation, which was distant from them twelue leagues. They vse bowes and arrowes, and do go naked.

                   who by another name are called by the Spaniards Patara Bueyes, their prouince is very and full of townes wt much people: their houses made of lime &amp; stone, and their townes traced in very good order: al the men &amp; womē haue their faces raced, &amp; their legs &amp; armes: they are corpulent people &amp; more decent then any that they had séene vntil that time: they haue great store of prouision, and hunt, both of beasts and foules: great store of fish, by reason of mightie riuers that commeth from the North, &amp; some of them as big as Guadalquiuiz ye which doth enter into ye North sea: they haue many lakes of salt water which in certaine times of ye yeare do congeale, and they do make therof good salt.Good salt. They are warlike people, &amp; made shew thereof presently, for the first night yt the Spaniards had placed thēselues, with their arrowes they slew fiue horse, &amp; hurt as many more, and would haue left not one aliue, if they had not béene defended by the guarde. When they had done this mischiefe, they left the town, &amp; went to a mountain which was

harde by, whether as presently in the morning went their captaine with other fiue souldiers well armed with an interpreter called Peter, a naturall Indian borne, and with faire words and perswasions, he quieted them, and made peace, and caused them to descend into their towne and houses and perswaded them to giue aduice vnto their neighbours, that they were men that would hurt no bodie, neither came they thither to take away their goods, the which he obtained easely by wisedome, and in giuing vnto the Caciques certaine glasse beades and hartes which they carryed for that purpose, &amp; other trifles: so with this and with the good intretement done vnto them, there went many of them in the company of the Spaniardes many dayes alwayes traueling alongst the riuer side aforesayde, where as were many townes of Indians of this nation, the which indured twelue dayes iourney: in all the which the Caciques gaue aduice from one towne to another, out of the which they came forth and entertained the Spaniards without their bowes and arrowes, and brought with them victuals and other prouision and gifts, but in especiall hides and shamway skins very well dressed, so that those of Flanders do nothing excéed them. These people are all clothed, &amp; they found that they had some light of ye holy faith, for that they made signe vnto God, looking vp vnto heauen, and they do cal him in their language Apalito, and doo acknowledge him for Lord, by whose mightie hand and mercie they confesse to haue receiued life, &amp; to be a natural man, and al temporall goods. There came many of them with their wiues &amp; children to the religious Frier (that came with the captaine and souldiers, of whom we haue spoken off) for to crosse &amp; blesse thē, of whom being demanded, from whence &amp; of whom they had ye knowledge of God: they answered that of thrée christians &amp; one Negro that passed that way, &amp; remained there certaine daies amongst them, who according to the signes &amp; tokens they gaue them, should be Aluar Nunnez Cabesa de Vaca &amp; Dorantes, &amp; Castillo Maldonado &amp; one Negro, the which escaped out of ye fléete wherewith Panfilo de Naruaz entred into Florida, &amp; after that they had bin many dayes captiue &amp; slaues, they escaped &amp; came vnto these townes, wheras God by them did shew many myracles in healing (by the onely touching with their handes) many diseases &amp; sicke persons, by reason thereof they left great

fame in all that countrie. All this Prouince remained in peace and quietnesse, by which demonstration they did accompanie and serued the Spaniardes certaine dayes trauelling alongest the riuer side aforesaide.
               Within few dayes after they came vnto a great inhabitation of Indians, where they came foorth to receiue them, by newes that they had of their neighbours, and brought with thē many curious thinges made of feathers of different colours and many mantles made of cotton, barred with blewe and white, like vnto them that are brought from China, to truck for other thinges. All of them as well the men as women and children were clothed with shamway skins, very good and well dressed, yet could the Spaniardes neuer vnderstande what nation they were, for lacke of an interpreter that vnderstood their language they dealt with them by signes, and they shewed vnto thē certaine stones of rich metall, and being demaunded if they had of the same in their countrie: they answered by the same signes, that fiue dayes iourney from thence towardes the north west, there was great quantitie thereof, and howe that they would conduct them thether, and showe it vnto them, as afterwardes they did performe, &amp; did beare them companie two and twentie leagues, the which was all inhabited with people of the same countrie.
               So following the saide riuer, they came vnto an other inhabitance of much more people than the other past, of whom they were well receiued, and welcomed with many presents, especially of fish, for that they haue great store by reason of certaine great lakes not farre from thence, wherein is bred great abundance. They were amongest these people thrée dayes, in the which both day and night they made before them many dances according vnto their fashion, with a particular signification of great ioy. They knew not how this nation was called, for lack of an interpreter: But yet they vnderstoode that it extended very farre, and was very great. Amongest this nation they found an Indian, a Concho by nation, who tolde, and made signes that fiftéene iourneyes from thence towardes the north west, there was a lake which was verie broad, and nigh vnto it very great townes and in thē houses of thrée and foure stories high, the people well apparelled, and the countrie full of victuals and

prouision, who did offer himselfe to bring them thether, wherat the Spaniards reioyced, but left to giue the enterprise, only for that they would accomplish their intent and begon voiage, which was to go to the north to giue ayde vnto the two religious men aforesaide. The chiefe &amp; principall thing that they noted in this prouince, was, that it was of a good temperature, and a rich countrie, great store of hunt, both of foot and wing, many rich metals and other particular thinges of profite.
               From this prouince they folowed their iourney for the space of 15. daies, without méeting any people: they trauelled amōgst high &amp; mightie pine trées like those of Spaine, at the end wherof, after they had traueiled to their iudgmēts four score leagues▪ they came vnto a small village of very few people, very poore, &amp; their houses made of strawe: they had great quantity of déere skins as well dressed as those yt are brought out of Flanders, great store of excellent white &amp; good salt. They gaue them good intertainment for the space of two daies yt they remained there, after the which they did beare thē companie 12. leagues, vnto certaine great habitations, alwayes trauelling alongst the riuer side towarde the north as aforesaide, till such time as they came vnto the countrie which is called the new Mexico. All alongst this riuer side was planted full of white salow trées, and in some place, it was foure leagues brode. Likewise there was many walnut trées, and peare trées like vnto those in Spaine.
               In the ende of two dayes trauaile amongest these trées, they came vnto tenne townes the which were situated alongst this riuer side on both partes, besides others that appeared, but farther distant. It seemed vnto them to haue much people, and as appeared to be more than tenne thousande soules.
               In this Prouince they did receiue them courteously, and carried them vnto their townes whereas they gaue them great store of prouision and hennes of the countrie, with many other things, and that with a great good will. In these townes were houses of foure stories high, verie well wrought and gallant chambers,Houses of 4. tories high. and most of them had steuues or hote houses for the winter. They are all apparelled with cotton and of deares skinnes. the manner and apparell both of the men and of the women, is much like vnto the Indians, of the kingdome of Mexico. But that which did cause them most for to woonder,

was, to sée both men and women to weare both bootes and shooes of very good lether, with thrée sooles of neates leather: a thing which they haue not séene but onely there. The women go without any thing vpon their heades, but their haire trimly kembed and dressed. Euerie one of these townes had Caciques by whom they were gouerned, as amongest the Indians in Mexico with sergeantes and officers to execute their commandement, who goe through the stréetes of the towne, and declare with a loude voice the will of the Caciques, the which is straight wayes put in vre.
               In this prouince the Spaniardes sounde many Idolles that they worshipped,They worship the diuel and in euery house they had a temple wherein they do worship the diuell, wheras ordinarily they do carrie him to eat. Likewise as amongst Christians in the high wayes they doo put crosses, so haue they chappelles, whereas they say, the diuell doth recreate and rest himselfe, when as he trauelleth from one towne to an other: the which chappelles are maruellously well trimmed and painted.
               In all their tyllages and ploughed groundes, of the which they haue many and very great: they haue on the one side of them, a portall or shedde built vppon foure pillers, whereas the labourers doo eate and passe away the heate of the day, and are people verie much giuen to labour, and doo continually occupie themselues therein: it is a countrie full of mountaynes and woods of pine trées. Their weapons are strong bowes and arrowes with their heads or pointes made of flint stone, wherwith they will pierce and passe a shirt of mayle or plate coate. They vse also Macans the which is a staffe of half a yeard long made of flint and verie smoth, wherewith they may cut a man a sunder in the midst, they vse also bucklers and targets made of rawe hides.
            
            
               CHAP. IX. Still doth hee prosecute the new Mexico, and declareth of such things as were there seene.
               SO after they had béene foure dayes in this prouince, they departed, &amp; not farre distant from the same, they came vnto an

other, which was called the prouince of the Tiguas, in the which they found sixtéene townes, in the one of the same called Poala, they vnderstood that the Indians had slaine the two Friers Francisco Lopez and Frier Augustine, whome they went to seeke: and with them thrée boyes &amp; a Mestizo. But when they of this towne &amp; their neighbours vnderstoode, being pricked in conscience, &amp; fearing that the Spaniards came to plague them, and to be reuenged for the death of the saide fathers, they durst not abide, but left their houses voide, and fled vnto the mountaines that were nighest hande, from whence they could neuer cause them to descende, neither by giftes nor policie. They founde in their houses great store of victualles and an infinite number of hennes of the countrie, diuers sortes of metals, and some of them séemed to be very good: they could not perfectly vnderstande the number of people that were in that countrie, for that they were fled vnto the mountaines, as aforesaid.
               Being fully certified of the death of them that they went to séeke for, they entred into counsell to determine whether they should returne vnto new Bizcaya, from whence they came, or to procéede forwarde: in the which there were diuers opinions. But by reason that they vnderstoode there, that towardes the port of the orient from that place, and not farre distant from that prouince, there were very great townes and rich, and finding themselues so nigh them, the captaine Antonio de Espero with the consent of the religious Fryer aforesaide called Bernardino Beltran, and the most part of his souldiers &amp; companions, determined to procéede forwardes in the discouerie thereof, till such time as they did sée to what end it would come. that they might the better giue perfect and iust notice therof vnto his maiestie, as witnesses that had séene it.
               So being in conformitie they determined, they remayning there sentenela, or royall companie, the captaine with other two companions with him should go forwardes in the demand of their desire, which foorthwith they put in execution. So at the end of two dayes of their trauaile, they came vnto a prouince, where they discouered aleuen townes, and much people in them, which in their iudgement did passe fortie thousand soules. It was a countrie very well replenished &amp; fertile, whose confines are ioyned vnto the lande of the Cibola, whereas is

great store of kyne, of whose skins they do apparell themselues and with cotton, hauing the vse of gouernement amongest thē, as their neighbours haue: there are signes and tokens of many rich mynes, and found in their houses certaine mettalles, these Indians do worship Idols: they receiued the Spaniardes with peace, and gaue them to eate. Seéing this and the disposition of the countrie they returned vnto their sentenela from whence they departed, to giue notice vnto their companions of all that hath béene saide.
               So when they were come vnto their companions aforesaid, they had notice and vnderstanding of an other prouince called the Quires, which was vp the riuer on the north, sixe leagues distant. So they departed thitherwardes, and when they came within a league of the place: there came foorth in peace a great companie of Indians, and requested that they would goe with them vnto their townes: the which they did, and were verie well entertayned and had great cheare. In this prouince they sawe but onely fiue townes, in the which there was a great number of people, which vnto their iudgement did passe fiftéene thousand soules, and doo worship Idolles as their n
                     •
                  ighbours doo. They found in one of these townes a Pye in a cage, as is the vse in Spaine, &amp; Tirasoles as those which are brought from China, and painted on them the sunne &amp; the moone with many starres: and taking the altitude thereof, they founde it to be in seuen and thirtie degrées and a halfe vnder the north poole.
               They departed from this prouince, and trauelling by the same course or Rutter, fourtéene leagues from thence, they came to an other prouince called the Cunames, whereas they discouered other fiue townes: and that which was the principal and biggest of them, is called Cia, which was of such huge bignesse yt it had in it eight places: their houses be plastered with lyme, and painted with diuerse colours, much better than they had séene in any prouince past. It séemed that the people that were there did passe in number twentie thousande soules: they gaue presentes vnto the Spaniardes with many curious mantelles, and of victualles to eate maruellously well dressed, and iudged the people to be more curious and of more estimation of themselues, than any that thitherto they had séene, and of greater gouernement. They shewed vnto them rich metalles,

and the mountaines that were hard by,ich metals. whereas they did take it out. Here they had notice of an other prouince which was towards the north west, and determined to go thither.
               So after they departed frō thence, &amp; had trauailed sixe leagues, they came to ye said prouince, which was called Arneias, in the which was seuē great townes, &amp; in thē according to their iudgment, thirtie thousand soules: they said that one of these seuen townes was very great &amp; faire, the which they would not go to see, for yt it was situated behinde a mountaine, as also they feared some euill successe, if that they should be deuided the one frō the other. They are people after ye fashion of the other prouince their neighbors, with as much prouision and as well gouerned. Fiftéene leagues from this prouince, trauelling cōtinually towards ye northwest, they came to a great towne called Acoma: it had in it more than sixe thousande soules: it was situated and placed vpon a high rock, the which was more than fiftie fadam in height, and had no other entry but by a payre of staires, the which was made &amp; cut out of the same rocke, a thing the which did cause great admiration vnto the Spaniardes: all the water that they had in this towne was in cesterns. The principallest hereof came with peace for to sée the Spaniards, &amp; brought thē many mantles, and shamwayes very well dressed, and great quantitie of prouision, they haue their corne fields two leagues from that place, and for to water them they take water out of a small riuer there harde by. Upon the saide riuer side they sawe many fields with roses, like vnto those that are in Spain: there are many mountaines which shewe to haue mettals, although they went not vp to sée it, for that the Indians be many, &amp; very warrelike people. The Spaniards remained in this place thrée daies, in one of the which the naturall people thereof did make vnto them a solemne dance, &amp; came foorth in the same with gallant apparell and with maruellous ingenious pastimes with the which they reioyced excéedingly. So four &amp; twentie leagues from this place, they came vnto a prouince called in their naturall language Zuny, and the Spaniards do call it Cibola, there is in it a great number of Indians. In the which was Francisco Vazquez Coronado, and left there erected many crosses and many other signes and tokens of christendome, which continually did remaine standing. They found there three christened

Indians, which were left there at that time, whose names were, Andres de Cuyoacon, Gasper de Mexico, and Antonio de Guadalaiara, who had almost forgotten their own language, &amp; could speake very well that of this countrie: yet with a little vse after they had talked with thē they did easily vnderstand them. Of these they vnderstood that thrée score iourneyes from thence was there a lake very great about the which was situated many excellent good townes, &amp; that the natural people thereof had very much gold, &amp; it séemed to be true for that they did all weare braslets &amp; eareringes of the same. The foresaide Francisco Vazques Coronado hauing certaine intelligence of the same he departed from this prouince of Cibola, &amp; went that way: and hauing trauelled twelue iourneyes, his water did faile him, so yt he determined to returne backe againe as he did, with pretence to returne an other time, whē better oportunity should be had: the which afterwards he did not put in executiō, for that by death all his determinations &amp; pretēces were cut off.
            
            
               CHAP. X. Still doth he prosecute the discouery of the new Mexico.
               VPon the newes of this great riches aforesaide, the sayde captaine Antonio de Espeio, determined to go thether, where were of his opiniō the most part of his cōpanions: but ye religious fryer was of the contrarie opinion, &amp; sayd that it was high time to returne vnto new Bizcaya frō whence they came, for to giue notice of all that they had séene, the which they did put in execution within few daies after, the most part of them: and left the captain with alonely nine companions that would follow him. Who after that hee had fully certified himselfe of the riches aboue said, and of the great quantitie of good metals, that were there. He departed out of this prouince with his companions, and trauelled towardes the northwest.
               So after that they had trauelled eight and twentie leagues, they came into an other prouince the which was very great, in the which to their iudgmēt were more thā fifty thousand soules: whose inhabitants, when they vnderstood of their cōming they sent thē a messenger, which said, yt if they would not be slaine of them, yt they should not approch any nearer vnto their townes.
               
                  Unto the which the said captaine answered, that they came not thether to do them any harme as they should well perceiue, and also did request them that they would not disturbe them in the prosecuting of their pretence, and gaue vnto the messenger certaine things such as they carryed with them, who did praise so much the Spaniards, that he did appease the troubled minds of the Indians, in such sort, that they did of their owne good wil grant them licence for to enter into their townes. The which they did with one hundreth and fiftie Indians their friends, of the Prouince of Cibola aforesaide, and with the thrée Indians of Mexico, of whom we made mention.
               Before they came vnto the first towne by a league, there went foorth to méete and receiue the Spaniards more than two thousande Indians laden with victualles and prouision, vnto whome our Captaine did giue thinges of small price: yet it seemed vnto them to be of great estimation more than golde. So when they came nigher vnto the towne called Zaguato, there came foorth to receiue them a great number of Indians, and amongest them their Caciques, and made a great showe of mirth and ioy, and threw vppon the ground much flower of Maiz that their horse might tread vpon it. With these feastes, ioy and pleasure, they entred into the towne, whereas they were very well receiued, lodged, and made much of: the which the captaine did partly recompence, in giuing vnto all the principallest amongest them, hattes, and glasse beades, and many other thinges more, which they carried with them to serue the like oportunitie.
               The Caciques did foorthwith dispatch and send aduice vnto all those of that prouince, giuing them to vnderstande of the comming of their new guestes, and how that they were verie curteous men, &amp; did no harme. Which was occasion sufficient to cause them all to come laden with presentes vnto the Spaniardes, and did request them for to goe vnto their townes to sport and recreate themselues: the which they did, but alwaies with great care and respect of what so euer might happen. For the which t
                     •
                  e captaine did vse a policie with them, which was, that he tolde vnto the Caciques, that for so much as his horse were verie fierce and furious, and that they had told them that they would kill them, therefore for to shunne the damage and

harme that might happen vnto the Indians, it were requisite to make a fort with lyme and stone, to put them in. The Caciques did giue such credite vnto his words that in a few houres they had ioyned together so much people, that they made a fort according as the Spaniardes did request, &amp; that with an incredible breuitie. Besides this when the captaine sayd yt he would depart, they brought vnto him a present of fortie thousand mā
                  tles of cotton, some white, and some painted: and a great quantitie of hand towels with tassels at the corners, and many other thinges, and amongst them rich metals, which shewed to haue much siluer. Amongst these Indians they had great notice and knowledge of the lake aforesaid, &amp; they were conformable vnto the other, in that touching the great riches &amp; abundance of gold.
               The captaine hauing great confidence in this people and of their good dispositions, he determined after certaine daies yt he had bin there, to leaue fiue of his companions and the rest of the Indians his friends, that they might returne vnto the prouince of Zuny with all their bagage: and hee himselfe with the other four that remained, would go more at quiet to discouer certaine very rich mynes, of the which he had true notice. So according vnto his determination he departed with the guides he had, and hauing trauelled toward the northwest fiue &amp; forty leagues, he came vnto the saide mynes, and tooke out of the same with his owne hands rich metals, and very much siluer:Rich metals. the mynes had a great &amp; brode veine, it was vpon a rocke whereas they might go vp to it with great ease, for that there was a way open to yt effect: nigh therunto were certain townes of Indians amongst the mountaines, who shewed friendship vnto them, and came foorth to receiue them with crosses in their hands, &amp; other signes and tokens of peace: nigh vnto the same they saw two reasonable riuers, vppon whose hankes there were many vines full of excellent good grapes, great walnut trées, and very much flaxe, like vnto that of Spaine, and it was tolde them by signes, that on the other side of the saide mountaines there was a riuer of 8. leagues brode But they could not vnderstand how nigh it was, yet did they make demonstration, that it did run his course towards the north sea, and vpon both sides thereof was situated many townes, and of so huge bignes, that in comparison those wherein they were, were but suburbes in respect.
               
                  So after the Captaine had taken all this relation hee departed towardes the prouince of Zuny, whither he had cōmanded his other companions to goe, and at their comming thether in health, which was by an other excellent way, he found therwith his o
                     •
                  her fiue companions: the father Fryer Bernardino with the souldiers that were determined to returne backe agayne (as aforesayde) for as yet they were not departed from thence for certayne occasions. Unto whom the naturals of the countrie had giuen good intertaynement and all thinges necessarie, and that in abundance: and afterwardes did the like vnto the sayde Captaine and vnto them that came with him, and went foorth to receiue him with demonstration of great ioy, and gaue them great store of prouision for their iourney pretended, requesting him to returne againe with breuitie, and to bring with him many Castillas (for so they doo call the Spaniardes) and they would giue them all to eate: for the which (the better to accomplish the same) they had sowed that yeare more wheate and other graine, then they had done in any other yeare past.
               At this present the sayde religious Fryer and the rest of the souldiers did ratifie their first determination aforesaide, and concluded to returne vnto the Prouince from whence they came, with the pretence before spoken of, and there ioyned with him in that iourney, Gregorio Hernandez, who was standert bearer in that attempt.
               So when they were departed the captain who remained but with eight souldiers, did fully resolue himselfe to prosecute his begun pretence, &amp; to take his course vp alongst the north riuer: which being but in execution, and hauing trauelled about 60. leagues towards the prouince of Quires aforesaid, 12. leagues frō thence towards the orient, they came vnto a prouince called Gubates, whereas the Indians receiued them with peace, and gaue thē great store of prouision▪ and also notice▪ that not far frō thence there were certaine rich mynes, the which they founde, and tooke out of them glystering metale and very good, with the which they returned to the towne from whence they departed.
               They iudged this prouince to haue nigh vpon fiue &amp; twentie thousande soules, all well apparelled with painted mantles of cotton, &amp; shamwayes skins very well dressed. There are many

mountaynes and woodes of pine ceder trées, and their houses of foure and fiue stories hie. Héere had they notice of an other prouince that was but one daies iourney frō thence which was called of the Tamos, in the which was more thā fortie thousand soules, but when they came thether the inhabitants would not giue them any victuals, neyther permit thē to enter into their townes▪ for the which, to auoyde the danger wherin they were, being but a few souldiers (as aforesaid) and some of them sicke, they determined to depart thence towardes the countrie of christians, the which they put in execution the beginning of Iuly in the yere 1583. and were conducted by an Indian that went with them, who carried them by a contrarie way and different from that they came, downe alongest the riuer side, which they called of the Vacas. By reason that there was great store of kine all alongest the same. By the which they trauelled one hundred and twentie leagues. From thence they came vnto the riuer of the Conchas there whereas they first entred, and from thence vnto the vale of S. Bartolmew from whence they departed to begin this discouerie. And when they came thether they vnderstood that many dayes before were arriued there in health, frier Bernardino Beltran and his companions, &amp; were gonefrom thence vnto the village of Guadiana. In this towne the captaine Antonio de Espeio made a certaine &amp; true information of all this aforesaide, the which presently he sent vnto the Earle of Corunnia, viceroy of that kingdome: and he sent it vnto his maiestie, and vnto the Lords of the royall counsell of the Indians, that therin they might ordaine that which séemed them best, the which they haue done with great care. I beséech the Lord God if it be his pleasure that it may go forwardes in such order, that so many soules redéemed by his precious bloud be not condemned: whose wits &amp; vnderstanding do farre excéed those of Mexico &amp; Peru, as by ye information of those yt haue delt with thē appeareth, wherby we may presume that with great facilitie they will imbrace the law of the gospell, and leaue the Idolatrie that the most part of them do vse, which God for his mercies sake permit, so it may be for his glorie, and exalting of the catholike faith
               I haue bin tedious in this relation, more than a commentarie doth require, but I haue doone it by reason it is a newe

thing and little abrode as yet, and it séemeth to mee not to giue discontent vnto the reader. And now me thinketh it shall bee well that I doo returne vnto my matter first begunne, and to procéede and go forwardes in the voyage and description of the new worlde, returning vnto the citie of Mexico, there where as I did digresse for to declare the discouerie of the newe Mexico,
               
            
            
               CHAP. XI. Departing from the citie of Mexico, they go vnto the port of Acapulco in the south sea, whereas they doo imbarke themselues from the Ilandes Philippinas, they passe by the Ilandes of theeues, and do declare the rites and condition of that people.
               FRom the citie of Mexico they go to imbarke themselues or take shipping at the port of Acapulco which is in the south sea, and is eleuated from the poole nineteen degrées, and ninetie leagues from the citie of Mexico: in al which way there be many townes inhabited with Indians and Spaniards.
               Being departed from this port they sayle towards the south west, till they come into twelue degrées &amp; a halfe, to séeke prosperous wind to serue their turne, which the marriners do call Brizas, and are northerly windes, which are there of such continuance &amp; so fauourable, that being in the moneths of Nouember, December, and Ianuarie, they haue no néede to touch their sayles, which is the occasion that they do make their voyages with so great ease. So that for that, &amp; for the fewe stormes that happened in that passage, they do cal it the mar de Damas (which is the sea of Ladies).The sea of Ladies. They sayle alwayes towards the west, following the sunne when as she departeth from our hemispherie. In this south sea they sayle fortie daies without séeing anie lande: at the end whereof they came to the Ilandes of Velas, which by an other name are called de los Ladrones: there are seuen or eight of them, they do lye north and south, and are inhabited with much people, in the order as you shall vnderstand.
               These Ilands are in 12. degrées, but there are different opinions of the leagues yt are betwixt the port of Acapulco &amp; those

Ilands, for vnto this day there is none that hath vnderstood the cert
                     ••
                  ntie thereof, for that their nauigation lieth from the east vnto the west, whose degrées there haue bin none yt 
                  
                     •
                  uer could measure. Some say, this iourney hath a thousande and seuen hundred leagues, others a thousand and eight hundred, but the opinions of the first we vnderstand to be most certaine.
               All these Ilands are inhabited with white people of comely faces, like vnto those of Europa, but not of their bodies,White people as bigge as gyants. for that they are as bigge as gyants, and of so great force and strength: for one of them hath taken two Spaniardes of a good stature, the one by one foot and the other by the other with his handes, &amp; hath lifted them both from the grounde with so great ease, as though they had bin two children. They go naked from top to too, as well women as men, yet some of them were woont to weare an aporne made of a deares skinne before them of halfe a yeard long, for honesties sake, but they are but a fewe in nū
                  ber, in respect of those yt weare nothing before them. The weapons which they do vse be s
                     •
                  inges, &amp; darts hardened in the fire, and are with both the one and the other very expert throwers.
               They do maintaine themselues with fish which they do take on the coast, and of wild beasts which they do kill in the mountaines, in ouertaking of them by swiftnesse of foot.
               In these Ilands there is one the strangest custome that euer hath bin heard of or séene in all the whole world, which is, that vnto the young men there is a time limited for them to marrie in (according vnto their custome) in all which time, they may fréely enter into the houses ofsuch as are married, and be there with their wiues, without being punished for ye same, although their proper husbands should sée them: they doo carrie in their handes a staffe or rodde, &amp; when they do enter into the married mans house they doo leaue it standing at the doore, in such sort, that if any do come after, they may plainly sée it: which is a token, that although it be her proper husband, he cannot enter in till it be taken away. The which custome is obserued and kept with so great rigour and force, that whosoeuer is against this lawe, all the rest do kill him.
               In all these Ilands there is not as yet knowen neyther king nor lord, whom the rest should obey,without king or gouernor, which is the occasion that euery one do liue as he list and at his pleasure. These Ilandes

were woont to haue warre the one with the other, when occasion did force them: as it happened at such time as the Spaniardes were there in the port of the said Iland: there came abord their ships to the number of two hundred small barkes or botes in the which came many of the inhabitants thereof, to sell vnto them of the ships, hens, &amp; nuts called cocos, patatas, and other thinges of that Iland, and to buy other such things as our people did carrie with them, but in especiall yron (vnto the which they are very much affectionated) and vnto things of chrystall and such like of small estimation. But there grew a great contention amongest them, which people of what Ilande should first come vnto the shippes, and was in such order that they fell vnto blowes, and wounded the one the other maruellously more liker beastes than men: of the which there were many slaine in the presence of the Spaniards, and would neuer leaue off their contention a good while, till in the end by way of peace they consented a conclusion amongest themselues, but with a great noyse, which was, that those of one Iland should go to the larbord of the ship, and those of the other Iland should go to the starbord, with the which they were pacified, and did buy and sel at their pleasure. But at their departure from our people, in recompence of their good intertainment they threw into the ship of their dartes hardened with fire, with the which they did hurt many of thē that were aboue hatches: yet went they not away scotfrée, for that our people with their hargabushes did paye them in readie money their bold attempt.
               
                  Iron more esteemed than siluer or gold.These people do more estéeme yron than siluer or golde, and gaue for it fruites nnames patatas, fish, rise, ginger, hennes, and many gallant mattes very well wrought, and all almost for nothing.
               Th
                     •
                  se Ilandes are verie fertile and healthfull, and very easie to bee conquered vnto the fayth of Christ. If that at such time as the ships doo passe that way vnto Manilla they would leaue there some religious men, with souldiers to garde them till the next yeare, and might be doone with small cost. It is not as yet knowen what ceremonies and rites they do obserue, for that there is none that doo vnderstande their language, neither hath any béene on those Ilandes, but onely as they haue passed by, which is the occasion that they cannot be vnderstood.

The language which they doo vse, to any mans iudgement is easie to be learned, for that their pronunciation is verie plaine, they call ginger asno, and for to say (take away your hargabush) they say arrepeque. The pronunciation of their wordes is neither in the nose nor in the throte. It is vnderstood that they be all Gentiles, by certaine signes and tokens that our people haue seene them do, and that they doo worship Idols, and the diuell, vnto whom they do sacrifice such as they do take in the warres of their borderers. It is thought that they doo descend of the tartares, by some particularities that is found amongst thē, the which do draw very nigh vnto some that they do vse.
               These Ilandes are south &amp; north with the land of Labrador, which is nigh vnto the new found lande, and not farre distant from the Ilande of Iapon. It is knowen for a trueth that they do deale with the Tartares, and that they do buy yron for to sell it vnto them. The Spaniards did giue name vnto these Ilandes as they passed by, the Ilandes of Ladrones (which is of théeues) for that they are very bolde and subtile in their s

I will declare vnto you one thing that happened in the presence of many Spaniardes, the which did cause them greatly to maruaile, which is, there was a marriner commanded by the captaine of the ship, to kéepe the sterneborde side, &amp; not to suffer any of them to enter therein, and being as one amased to sée so many Canoas that came thether, (the which be small barkes or botes made all of one péece) one of them diued downe vnder the water, till he came there whereas the marriner was (vnmindfull of any such matter should happen) &amp; vpon a soddaine without séeing the other, he snatched his sword out of his hand, &amp; went vnder the water againe therwith, the marriner made a noise &amp; declared the knauerie that ye Ilander had done vnto him. whervpon there were certaine souldiers yt made their hargubushes ready to shoot at him when he appeared frō vnder ye water. This Ilander perceiuing it, came foorth &amp; swimmed aboue the water, shewing his handes, &amp; made signes yt he had nothing in thē, which was the occasion that they did not shoot at him.
               So after a while that he had beene there resting of himselfe, he returned and diued vnder the water againe, &amp; swam so farre

as he thought that the bullet of the hargubush could not reach to hurt him, and finding himselfe in securitie, he tooke the sword from betwixt his legges whereas he did carrie it in secret, and beganne to florish with the same, mocking our people whom he had so easily deceiued.
               This kind of stealing, and many others which they had done and that with great subtiltie, is the occasion that they beare the names of théeues, and all the Ilandes whereas they doo dwell doo beare the name thereof, the which they will easily pardon, if they might ordinarily finde, where as they might execute their inclination.
            
            
               CHAP. XII. They depart from the Ilandes of the Ladrones, and come vnto them of Luzon, or Philippinas by an other name, and doo declare the particular thoughts of those Ilandes.
               FRom this Iland of Ladrones nauigating towards ye west, almost two hundred leagues, till they came to a mouth called of the holy ghost,
                     Archipelago.
                   they straightwaies doo enter into the Archipelago, (which is an infinite number of Ilands) almost all inhabited with their own naturall people. But many conquered by the Spaniardes, eyther by force of warre or friendship. Four score leagues from this is the citie of Manilla,
                  The Iland of Luzon, and citie of Manilla.
                   which is vpon the Iland of Luzon, there whereas ordinarily dwelleth the gouernor of all those Ilandes, &amp; the officers of his maiestie, therein is a bishop and a cathedrall church. This citie standeth in fourtéen degrées &amp; a quarter, and round about the same there are so many Ilandes, that vnto this day there is none that euer could number them: they do extend all of them northwest and southwest, &amp; north &amp; south, in so much that the one part stretcheth vnto the straight of Sincapura which is fiue and twentie leagues from Malaca, and the other part vnto the Malucos, &amp; other Ilandes, whereas they gather a great number of cloues, pepper, &amp; ginger, of the which there are great mountaines full. The first that discouered these Ilands were Spaniards,Geeat mountains of pepper, cloues, and ginger. which came to thē in the cōpany of ye famous Magellanes, &amp; made no conquest of thē, for that they knew better to nauigate then to

conquer, by reason whereof, after they had discouered and passed the straight (which vnto this day beareth the title of his name) and came vnto the Ilande of Zubu, whereas they did baptise certaine of the inhabitance, and afterwards in a banket, the same Ilanders did kill him, and other forty of his companions, which was the occasion that Sebastian de Guetaria, a naturall Biskin borne, for to escape with his life, did put himselfe in a shippe that remained of the voyage (which afterwards was named the victorie) and in her and with a few people that helped him, with the fauour of God he came vnto Siuell, hauing compassed the whole world, from the Orient vnto the Ponient, a thing which caused vnto all men great admiration, but in particular vnto the Emperor Charles the fift of famous memorie, who after he had giuen many gifts and fauours vnto the said Sebastian de Guetaria, hee gaue order that a new armie should be made ready, and to returne againe in demande of the said Ilands, and to discouer that new world.
               So when all things were in a redinesse for to depart on their voyage (the which was done with great breuitie) they ordained for generall of all that sleete one Villa Lobos, commanding him to go by the Nueua Espania. This Villa Lobos, arriued at the Ilands of Malucas, and at those of Terrenate &amp; at other Ilands ioyning vnto them, the which Ilands were laid to gage by the aforesaid Emperor vnto the crowne of Portugal.
               In these Ilands they had great wars by meanes of the Portugals, and séeing themselues with little helpe and small resistance, for to go forwards with their conquest, they left it off, and went to the most part of them with the aforesaide Portugals vnto the India of Portugall, from whence afterwards they sent them as prisoners vnto the said king of Portugall, as offenders, that had entred his Ilands without his licence: who did not onely leaue to do them any harme, but did intreat them very well and sent them vnto their owne country of Spaine, &amp; gaue them al thinges necessary for their iourney, and that in aboundance.
               Then certaine yeares after, Don Philip king of Spaine being very willing that the discouering shoulde go forwards, which the Emperor his father had so earnestly procured, sent and commanded Don Luys de Velasco, who was his vizroy of

the Nuoua Espania, that he would ordaine an army, and people for to returne and discouer the said Ilands, and to sende in the said fléete for gouernor of all that should bée discouered Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, who did accomplish all that his maiestie had commanded, and made the discouerie thereof in such order, as the first relation of the entrie of the fathers of the order of Saint Austen into the China dooth more at large appeare.
               Of ancient time these Ilandes were subiect vnto the king of China, vntill such time as hee did deliuer them vp of his owne frée will, for such reasons as were spoken off in the first part of this historie: &amp; that was the occasion that when ye Spaniards came vnto them, they were without Lorde or heade, or anie other to whom they shoulde shewe duetie, but hee which had most power and people did most command: so that this (and that there were so many of equal power) was the occasion that ciuill warres continued, without any respect of nature, kinred, or any other duety, but like vnto brute beasts, killing, spoiling and captiuing one another, the which was a great help
                     •
                   vnto the Spaniards for to subiect that countrie with so great ease vnto the king, and called them the Ilands Philippinas in respect of his name. They did vse amongst them to make captiues and slaues such as they did take in vnlawfull wars, and for trifling matters, the which God did remedie by the going thither of the Spaniards: for you should haue a man with fortie or fiftie other friends in his company, or seruants, that vpon a sodaine would go and set vpon a small village of poore people and vnprouided, and take and binde them all, and carrie them away for slaues without any occasion or reason, and make thē to serue them all the dayes of their life, or else sell them to other Ilands. And if it so chanced that one did lende vnto another a basket or two of Rice (the which might bee woorth a ryall of plate) with condition to returne it againe within ten dayes: if the debter did not pay it the same day, the next day following he should pay it dooble, and afterward to double it euery day so long as he did kéepe it, which in conclusion the debt would grow to be so great, that to pay the same, he is forced to yéeld himselfe for captiue and slaue.
               But vnto all such as were captiued in this order, or in such

like, the king of Spaine hath commanded to giue libertie, yet this iust commandement is not in euery point fulfilled and accomplished, because such as should execute the same haue interest therein. All these Ilandes were Gentiles and Idolaters, but now there is amongst them many thousands baptised, vnto whom the king hath shewed great mercie, in sending vnto thē the remedie for their soules in so good time: for if the Spaniards had stayed any more yeares, they had béene all Moores at this day, for th

                  t there were come vnto the Ilande of Barneo some of that sect that did teach them, and lacked little, for to worship that false prophet Mahomet, whose false, peruerse and corrupt memory, was with the Gospell of Christ easily rooted out.
               In al these Ilands they did worshippe the sunne and moone, and other second causes, figures of men and women, which are called in their language Maganitos, at whose feastes (which they do make ve

But amongst them all, they haue in most veneration an Idoll, whome they called Batala, the which reuerence they had for a tradition, yet can they not say what should be the occasion that he should deserue more then any of the rest, to bee had in so great estimation. In certaine Ilands not farre off, called the Illocos,

                   they did worship the diuell, and made vnto him many sacrifices, in recompence, of a great quantitie of gold hee had giuen vnto them, but nowe by the goodnesse of God, and the great diligence put and done by the fathers of the order of saint Austen (who were the first that passed into those parts, and liued worthely) and also by the friers of saint Francis, which went thither tenne yeares after, all these Ilands or the most part of them are baptised, and vnder the ensigne of Iesu Christ: and the rest which doo remaine and are not, is more for lacke of ministers and preachers, then for any obstinacie of their parts. There is nowe gone thither certaine fathers of the order called Iesuits, who will be a helpe vnto them with their accustomed zeale and labour. And nowe goeth thither many other religious men, very well learned and apostolike, of the order of saint Dominicke, who will doo their indeuour to conu

               CHAP. XIII. Here is declared of some notable things that are, and haue beene seene in these Ilands Philippinas.
               THey of these Ilandes were accustomed to celebrate their feastes aforesaid, and to make sacrifices vnto their Idols, by the order of certaine women which were witches,Vitches. whome they do call in their language Holgoi, yt were had in as great estimation amongst thē, as be the priests amongst Christians. These did talke ordinarily with the diuell, and many times in publike, and do diuellish witchcrafts both in words and déeds: into whom it is to be beléeued that the diuell did enter, for that straightwayes they did answere vnto all things that were demanded of them, although for the most part they woulde tell a lie, or els such wordes that might bee giuen diuers interpretations of, and of diuers vnderstandings. They did also vse to cast lottes, in such sorte as hath bene declared in the first part of this history: they were great Agorismers or obseruers of times: in so much that if they begin any iourney, and at the beginning they méete with a Cayman or lyzarde, or any other sauage worme, they know it to be a signe of euill fortune, whereupon they would straightwayes leaue off their iourney, although it did import them very much, and returne vnto their houses, saying, that the heauen will not that they shoulde go forwards on that iourney: but all these lies and falsenes which béene taught them, &amp; they perswaded to by the diuell, is ouerthrowne and taken away by the law of the Gospel (as aforesaide) &amp; haue now amongst them many monasteries full of religious men, of the order of saint Austen, saint Francis, and of Iesuits. According vnto the common opinion, at this day there is conuerted and baptised more then foure hundred thousand soules, which is a great number: yet in respect of the quantitie that are not as yet conuerted, there are but a few. It is left vndone (as aforesaid) for want of ministers, for that, although his maiesty doth ordinarily send thither without any respect of the great charge in doing the same, yet by reason that there are so many Ilands, and euerie day they doo discouer more &amp; more, and being so far off, they cannot come vnto them all, as necessitie requireth.

Such as are baptised, doo receiue the fayth with great firmenesse, and are good Christians, and would be better, if that they were holpen with good ensamples: as those which haue béene there so long time are bounde to doe: that the lacke thereof doth cause some of the inhabitantes so much to abhorre them, that they would not sée them once paynted vpon a wall. For proofe whereof (and for to moue such as haue power and authoritie to put remedie in the same, I will declare vnto you here a strange case, the which Royally did passe of a trueth in one of these Ilandes, and is verie well knowne amongst them: that is, there chanced to die an Ilander, a principall man amongst them, a few dayes after that he was baptised, being very contrite for his sinnes the which hee had done against God before he was baptised, and after hee died. So after by the deuine permission of God he appeared vnto many of that Ilands whom he did perswade forthwith to receiue the baptisme, with reasons of great efficacie, and declared vnto them (as one that had experienced the same) the rewarde of that good déede which without all doubt shoulde bee giuen vnto them, if they would receiue the same, and liue after conformable, and according vnto the commandements of Christ▪ for the which he told them and said that forthwith so soone as he was dead, he was carried by the Angels into glorie, there whereas all things were of delite, pleasure, and content, and did communicate onely in the sight of God, and that there was none that entred therein, neither coulde enter, except hee were baptised, according vnto the preaching of the Spaniards, of whome and of others that were like vnto them, there was an infinite number. Therefore if so be that they would go and inioy of those benefites and delights▪ it is necessarie that first they should be baptised, and afterwards to obserue and kéepe the commandements that be preached vnto them by the fathers, that are amongst the Castillas, and therewith he vanished away,The Indians would not go into heauen because there were spanish souldiers. and they remained treating amongst themselues concerning that which they had hearde, and was the occasion that some of them forthwith receiued the baptisme, and that others did delay it, saying, that because there were Spaniard souldiers in glory, they would not go thither, because they would not be in their company.
               All this hurt is done by one peruerse or impious man, and

with one euill ensample, the which amongst many good, as you haue in those parts: but in especiall amongst them in particular, it ought to bée reprehended and punished seuéerely with rigour.
               These Ilands at the first discouery of them, had the fame to bée Mal Sanos, or vnholesome, but since experience hath shewed and prooued it to the contrarie: It is a countrie maruellous fertill, and yeeldeth very much Rice, wheate, goates, hennes, deere, buffes, kine, and great stoare of hogges, whose flesh is so sauorie as the mutton they haue in Spaine: there be also manie cattes that yeelde siuet, great stoare of fruites which be very good and sauorie:Siuit. Honie. great aboundance of Honie, and fish, and all solde at so small a price, that almost it is solde for nothing.Sinamum. Also there is great stoare of Synamom, but no Oile of Oliues, but that which is carried thither out of the Nuoua Espania:Linseed Oile. they haue much Oyle of Algongoli and of Flaxe s

                  ede, the which they doo spende ordinarily in that countrie, so that the Oyle of Oliues is not missed with them.

Copper.There is great stoare of Cloues, Saffron, Pepper, Nutmegges and many other drugges: great stoare of cotton and silke of all colours, the which is brought vnto them by merchants of China, euerie yeare a great quantitie, from whence commeth more then twenty shippes laden with péeces of silkes of all colours, and with earthen vessell, powder, saltpeter, Iron, stéele, and much quicke-siluer, brasse, copper, wheate flower, walnuts, bisket, dates, linnen cloth, counting chestes very gallantly wrought, calles of networke, Buratos, Espumillas, basens and ewres made of tinne, parchment lace, silke fringe, and also of golde, the which is spunne and twisted after a fashion neuer s

               But amongst all other notable thinges that these Spaniards haue séene, in those Ilands, and in the kingdome of China, and other places whereas they passed: there is one thing which hath caused them most to maruel at, and to haue it most in memory, which is a trée, ordinarily called Palma de Cocos, but doth differ from that which beareth the dates, and with great reason, for that it is a plant so full of mysterie and profite, that there hath come a ship vnto these Ilands, and the said ship, and all that was in her to be sold, with ropes, cords, masts, sailes, and nailes were made of this trée, and the merchandice that she brought was mantels made of the rind of the saide trée, with great subtiltie and fine works. Likewise all the victuals that was in the said ship for the sustentation of thirtie mē that came in her, yea their water was of the same trée.
               The merchants that came in this ship did certifie of a truth, in all the Iland of Maldiuia from whence they came, they haue no other sustainment, but onely that which this tree yeeldeth: they do make houses hereof, and tyles for to couer the same, the fruit doth yéeld a Meollio or curnell, which is very sauory and healthfull, the sauor thereof is much like to gréene hasell nuts, and if you do cut the branch there whereas the Coco commeth forth is the principall fruite, and euery one of them hath ordinarily a pinte of water, the which is very swéet &amp; delicate al the said substance doth returne into the trunke of the tree, whereas they doo bore a hole, and thereat they do draw out all that water, which is much: and mingling it with other thinges they make thereof good wine, the which is drunk in al those Ilands and in the kingdome of China. Of the same water they make vineger, and of the Meollio kernell aforesaid, oile verie medicinall, milke like vnto Almon milke: hony and suger very sauorie. These and many other vertues hath this palme, whereof I haue declared part, for that they are notable, &amp; do cause admiration vnto all men that passe into those partes: I doo leaue to declare the rest because I would not be tedious. Nigh to ye cittie

of Manilla, on the other side of the riuer there is a towne of Chinos that be baptized, such as haue remained there to dwell to inioy the libertie of the gospel. There are amongst them many handicrafts men, as shoomakers, taylors, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and other officers, and some merchants.
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII. The barefoote Friers depart from the Iland of Luzon, vnto China, and is declared such as was there seene.
               FOr that the principall intent of these religious men when they went out of Spaine, was for to go vnto the mightie kingdome of China for to preach the holy gospell, and did perseuer continually with that desire, they woulde neuer intreat of any other thing, but onely to put it in execution: and for the accomplishing of the same, they sought many meanes and waies, sometimes in requesting the gouernor of his aide and helpe to procure the same, for that it was an easie thing to be performed, hauing continually ships of the merchants of China in the port of Manilla.
               
               The gouernor did driue them off with many reasons, but principally he laid before them that rigorous lawe, which they knew was established against such as did enter into that kingdome without particular licence, yet notwithstanding all this was not sufficient to abate the louing desire of those Friers, which was onely setled in their mindes for to go and preach the holy gospel in that kingdome by one meanes or other, although it were to put their liues in hazard: and for the prosecuting hereof, the comissary of those Ilands, who was Frier Geronimo de Burgos did elect sixe religious men for the same purpose: amongst them was the father Ignatio, of whome I (as I haue said) vnderstood by writing and relation, many thinges, the which is declared in these Itinerario or comentarie: so that there was with him seuen religious men, all seruants of God, and very desirous of the saluation of soules, which was the occasion that they put themselues in so long and tedious a iourney, leauing their owne countrie and quietnesse. These seuen with the good will of the gouernor Don Gonsalo Ronquillo, and of the bishop, whom they did ouercome and winne with requests

and perseuerance, and carried in their company a Spaniard their friende, called Iohn De Feria, of Andolozia, and other two souldiers that went with pretence to become friers, one Portugall and sixe Indian Ilanders: all the which the eight day after Corpus Christi, which was the one and twentie day of Iune, in anno 1582. they departed from the port of Cabite, whereas they did imbarke themselues in a barke of the saide Iohn De Feria, and making saile at fiue of the clocke in the afternoone, in the morning betimes they founde themselues twentie leagues ouerthwart the port that is called Del Fraile, whereas they determined to go to sea, leauing the coast of the Ilande of Manilla, which lieth North and South with China: from the which Cittie which is (as I haue saide) in fourtéene degrées and a halfe, vnto the Cape of Boxeador which is in ninetéene, it is one hundreth leagues sailing, and from this Cape to the firme land of China, they count it scarce fourescore leagues. And God was so pleased, although they had two dayes calme, the seuenth day, which was the day before the apostle saint Peter and saint Paule, at eight of the clocke in the morning, they discouered the firme lande of China: then straightwaies vpon the sight thereof, the comissarie commaunded to bring foorth the habites which hee carried readie made for to put vpon the Friers, for that when the Chinos shoulde see that they were all Friers, they should be voide of all suspition, to thinke them to be spies, as they thought when the first Friers went thither (as hath beene tolde you,) and not contented herewith, hee threw all the souldiers apparell into the sea, and one hargabus of Iohn De Feria, with the Flaske wherein he carried his powder, and all other thinges such as he thought woulde be a hurt and hindrance vnto them, if it should so fall out that they shoulde erre out of the port whereas the Portugals doo vse, and fall vppon the coast, as afterwards it fell so out, they left nothing but a match which they forgot, which lacked very little to haue cost them full deere. But when they had sight of the lande, they did not well knowe it, for that they had neuer séene it before, &amp; were also ignorant of the ports, although they were very neere to ye bay of Canton, they tooke their course vnto the Northwest, wheras they should haue gone to the Southwest, which was ye occasion yt they came vnto the

prouince of Chincheo. This day at fiue a clocke in the afternoone they discouered a port that was not farre from them, whither they sailed and entred in, and came to an anker on the outmost side, yet with great feare and dread, for that they knew not the secu
                     •
                  itie thereof, neither the trouble that might happen.
               They were not so soone at an anker, but they saw come forth of the said port many barkes, both small and great, and in them many souldiers with hargabusses, lances, swordes and targets, and in their soreshippe some small péeces of ordinance. And when they came nigh vnto the barke wherein the Spaniards were, within musket shot, they stayed and discharged great stoare of hargabus shot. But they who carried no armor to offende others, neither to defende themselues, the answere that they gaue vnto the shot, was making of many signes of peace, calling them with their handes to come nearer vnto them, that they might sée and vnderstand that they came not thither with any pretence to do harme: Yet all was not sufficient to cause them to leaue off their shooting, neither to come any nearer vnto their barke. At this present there was amongst the souldiers one Chino that had béene at Luzon, and did knowe the Spani
                     •
                  rds, being of God inspired: hee made signes vnto the rest, to leaue off their shooting, which presently they did: and hee came with his Brigantine vnto their barke, and after him all the rest: who when they sawe that they had neyther armour nor weapon, neither will to flie from them, they entered into the barke, and with their naked swordes in their hands flourishing with them ouer the heads of the Spaniards, with a great noise and tumult, they carried them into the port, which was called Capsonson, whereas was a generall of a great armie of shippes that were at an anker in the saide port, who straightwaies commanded that there should be carried on borde his admirall foure of the Spaniards, the which they vnderstoode was doone to take their liues from them: for the which, by reason they did not name any person, foure religious men did offer themselues to goe, and after they had confessed themselues, they tooke their leaue of their companions, and carried euery one of them a crosse in his hande, and his breuiarie, without any other thing else.
               
                  So when they came before the captaine, they founde him more meeker and milder then they thought to haue done (surely a worke done by God in recompence of the great perill that those his seruants did put themselues in to doo his seruice and commandement). He asked of them, from whence they came, and wherefore, with many other questions in effect: but when that hee was certified of the truth, hee commanded them to returne againe vnto their barke, without doing vnto them anie other harme, yet with a straite precept that they should not go forth without his expresse licence.
               So with this commandement they remained in their barke thrée dayes, guarded with many barkes and souldiers: and the last of them, the Captaine sent for two of the religious men, and when they came before him, he commanded them to be carried before a Iustice, a friend of his there hard by. These Iustices did talke with them with so great grauitie, and signes of cruelty, that euery time they came before them, they thought verely that forthwith they would command them to be carried to be executed: and without all doubt, either they had wil to do it, or else to put them in great feare of death, for that it was plainely seene in diuers things they commanded: but especially in one day there came vnto them a Iudge, with many armed men, and compassed their barke round about with a great number of Brigandines, with plaine signes to giue thē assalt, or else to sinke them: but within a little while they were all in quiet, and the Iudge entred into a shippe that was thereby at anker, and being set in a rich chaire, guarded with many souldiers about him, hée commanded the rest that were in the Brigandines forthwith to go to visite and search their barke, and sent with them an interpreter, one of Chincheo, who did a little vnderstande the Portugall tongue. These souldiers carried in their handes blacke banners, and other heauie and sorowfull signes (which is vsed in that kingdome, when at any time they doo execute anie person.) So after they had made their v

But when the Indians of the Ilands saw it, they wept bitterly, which mooued the Spaniards vnto great compassion, although they were themselues in the same trance and perill, and as nigh their death, &amp; made no other reckoning insomuch that two of the religious men séeing them so nigh

                     •
                  , and thought verely that they carried them vnto execution: which was the occasion that a Spaniard, one of them that went with pretence to be a frier, &amp; the habite on, hauing in his power 
                     •
                   thousand &amp; sixe hundred rials of plate, he threw them into the sea, saying, seeing that I am going to dye, I wil that it be in the habite of saint Francis, with the pouerty in which the glorious saint liued and died, for to follow him in his steps aright. With this feare aforesaid they were carried towards the tower: but when they came nigh to it, there followed after the souldiers that carried them a skiffe, with many oares, in great hast, &amp; called a loud vnto thē saying, yt the captaine general commanded yt they should bring back againe those prisoners to his shippe, the which forthwith they accomplished: &amp; after he had demanded of them certain questions, he commanded to carry them to the said tower, the which was done, as they could perceiue, for to put them in more feare. So after they had feared &amp; scared them with this rigorous tētation. The saide captaine himselfe went into one of ye 
                  Brigandines, &amp; went with them on land, whereas presently when he came on shoare, hee carryed the Spaniards into a temple of their Idols, vnto whome hee did his accustomed reuerence, yet the religious men, although they were with great feare of death as afore saide, they woulde not imitate him, but turned their faces

from their Idols, and did spit at them, giuing the captain to vnderstand by signes, that he should not worshippe them, for that they had no more goodnesse in them, then was giuen by man, so that by good reason, to the contrary, those Idols should giue reuerence vnto men because they made them, and to whome they ought to giue their true worship, is vnto the true God, the creator of heauen and earth.
               By this act it is plainely to bee séene the gift of strength, the which the holy Ghost doth giue vnto his baptized Christians as in these religious men, that were at deathes doore, yet had they strength and spirit for to resist and reprehende them that could take away their liues. The captaine although he made a shew that he was offended with that which hee had séene them do, yet hee did them no harme, but presently brought them out of the temple, and commanded the souldiers to remaine there and guard them all that night: the which they passed lying vpon the grounde, and yet thought themselues happie, and gaue thankes to God for that hee had deliuered them from the death that was so nigh vnto them.
            
            
               CHAP. XV. Here hee doth prosecute in things which the saide fathers did see, and vnderstand, the second time they entred into the kingdome of China, and of the troubles they passed.
               THe next day in the morning the Priest of the Idols did open the temple, whereas presently they put in the Spanish religious men, who sawe him and his ministers lighting of little candels, and making perfumes vnto their Idols, with manie superstitious ceremonies, the which being done, they cast certaine lottes (a thing much vsed amongst them) as they vnderstoode it was done for to consult with the diuel (who was within those Idols) to know what they should do with them, yet this they could not perfectly vnderstand, but straightwaies they were carried out of the temple, and brought by the souldiers before a iudge, who was the chiefe and principall of all the sea of that prouince, and was sixe leagues from the place in a Cittie called Quixue: the way thither was very plaine and

brode, and paued, and vpon both sides there were fields both of corne and flowers. So with the helpe of God, the Spaniards came before the presence of this general in eight days, although it was with great trauell, by reason they had neither force nor strength for to trauell, for that they had lost it with the heauie and sorowfull newes as aforesaid.
               Yet notwithstanding at their comming to the citty Quixue, the souldiers had them in continuall guard and kéeping, till the next day following, then they were carried before the generall, where he was in a very great &amp; faire house, the which had two cou

                  ts, one of them was next vnto the doore of the stréete, and the other was towards the farther partes of the house, both of them were railed round about in manner of grates: they were planted full of diuers sortes of great trées, wherein did féed a great number of déere and other wilde beasts, but yet as tame as sheepe. Right ouer against the inwarde court there was a gallerie, whereon was many soulidiers which did guarde and kee
                     •
                  e the person of the generall, who was in a mightie great and gallant hall, set in an Iuorie chaire with great maiestie. Before they entred into the seconde court, there was discharged within, both artilerie and habagus shot, and played vpon a drum, which was as bigge as those which they vse in Spaine: that being doone, there was a great sounde of hoybuckes and trumpets, and of many other instruments: the which being doone, they straightwayes opened the gates of the innermost court, whereas the gallerie was aforesaide, from whence they might sée the throne whereas the generall was set. There was before him a table whereon was paper and other necessaries for to write (a thing commonly vsed in all that countrie:) the souldiers that were his guarde were, all in one liuerie of silke, &amp; were in so gallant consort, &amp; had so great sylence, which made the Spaniards greatly to maruell: The first order was of the hargabushes, and the seconde were pikes, and betwixt the one and the other, was placed a sworde and a target, there might be about foure hundred souldiers. Behinde them were placed the officers of iustice or executioners, with their instruments for to whippe and punish offenders: and in the midst of them were the scriueners and proctors.
               About thirtie paces more or lesse from the chaire where the

generall was set, was placed certaine Gentlemen, and to the number, of a dosen pages bare headed, verie gallantlie apparelled in silke and golde. In the middest amongst these souldiers were the Spaniards carried, and before them such tokens and shewes, as they doo vse when as they doo present before the Iudges such as bee condemned vnto death. A good way before they came nigh vnto the place whereas the general was, they caused them to knéele downe: at which instant there was brought foorth certaine Chinos that were prisoners to be iudged, and so soone as their inditement was read, and iudgement giuen, the executioners did execute the rigour of the sentence in the presence of the Spaniards, first pulling off their apparell, and then making fast their hands and féete verie fast with cordes, in such sort, that they shriked that the noise reached vnto heauens: they kept them so bounde vntill they sawe farther what the Iudge woulde commaunde. who when hee had heard his inditement, if hee woulde that hee should bée whipped, hée striketh a blow with his hand vppon the table that is before him: then the executioners doo strike fiue blowes vppon the calues of the legges of the offender with a broad cane, in the order as hath béene saide, and is so cruell that none can suffer fiftie of them but he dieth. The blowe being giuen vppon the table by the generall, straightwayes one of the proctors maketh a crie or noise, where at presently commeth the executioner for to execute his office. And if the offender dooth deserue more, then the Iudge dooth strike another blowe vppon the table: then is there giuen him other fiue blowes, and in this sort dooth the Iudge so manie times as his offence dooth deserue. At the lamentations and shrikes that these miserable offenders doo giue, the Iudges shewe no more signe of pittie then if they were stroken vppon a stone. So the audience being concluded and doone with the naturals of the countrie, the generall commaunded that the Spanyardes shoulde come a little nearer, and looked and searched their garments and all the rest, as also their Breuiarios &amp; books: that being done, they were informed by those that brought them, how and in what order they were apprehended, and of all other thinges touching their comming into that kingdome: vnderstanding thereof, hee commaunded them to

be carried vnto prison, where they were put in sure holde, and with great watch and guard for certaine dayes, in the which time they passed incredible trouble, as well of hunger as of thirst and heat, which was the occasion that the most part of them fell sicke of agues, and of the laske.
               So after these dayes that they were in prison, they were carried once againe to the audience, and many other more were brought forth to be visited, all people beléeuing that the Spaniards should no more returne, but bee executed, for the which they receiued great cōtent, to be cleared by one death, of so many as dayly they had before their eyes. In the conclusion of this audience the generall did decrée, that they should be carried by sea vnto the Cittie of Canton, whereas was the vizroy of that prouince, and he to commande them to be executed or punished according as hee thought best, according vnto the penalty put vppon whatsoeuer straunger that should enter into that kingdome without licence (as they did enter). But when they saw that they were carried out of the prison vnto the sea, they verelie beléeued that it was to drowne them therin, for the which (hauing a newe confessed themselues, and commended themselues vnto God) they did animate one another, with the representation of the reward which was prepared for them: but when they came vnto the barre whereas they should imbarke themselues, vppon a suddaine the sea beganne to waxe verie loftie and troublesome, that it séemed almost a myracle, and it increased in such sort, that the souldiers and mariners said, that neuer before they had séene the like torment, the which endured the space of tenne dayes: the which was the occasion that they did not imbarke themselues, and that the generall did change his pretence, and determined that they shoulde be carried by lande vnto the great Cittie of Saucheo Fu, the which was presently put in vre: they were manie dayes on this iourney, with fiftie souldiers that did guarde them: in the which they sawe so manie curious thinges, and of so great riches, that they iudged it to bée the best countrie in all the world.
               So when they came vnto the citty, with so small trouble and werinesse, by reason of their long iourney and euill intreatings by the souldiers, they were presently carried (as might

be sayde) from Herode to Pylate, and escaped not one day, but they were carried to the publike audience, or else before some particular Iudge. This citie was very fresh both within and without, and full of many orchards, whereas were an infinite number of fruite, with gardens, stanges of water, and other thinges of great recreation. This citie is thrée times so bigge as Siuell, and compassed about with a mightie strong wall, their houses are very great and well wrought, their stréetes are excéeding faire, brode and long and so straight that from the one end vnto the other they may sée a man. In equall distance the one from the other, there are built many triumphall arkes: (which is an ordinarie and common thing vsed in the cities of that kingdome) vpon their gates there are little towers, wheron is planted all the artilerie that they haue for the defence of the citie (as hath béen said) all the which is inuironed and compassed about with a riuer which is great and faire, on the which is ordinarily sayling an infinite number of barkes and brigandines, and is of so great depth, they may come &amp; lye harde vnto the wall, yea ships of great burden. On the one side of the citie there is a little Iland of great recreation, vnto the which they do passe by a very faire bridge, the one halfe made of stone and the other of timber, and is of so great a length, that on the part that is made of stone, the father fryer Ignacio did tell thirtie Innes or victualing houses wheras was to be bought, not only flesh and fish, but also great store of marchandice, of great estimation and valure, as amber, musk e, péeces of silke and cloth of golde.
            
            
               CHAP. XVI. The Spaniardes are sent vnto the citie of Hucheofu, &amp; doo declare what happened there vnto them.
               FRom the citie of Saucheofu they were sent vnto Hucheofu the which is more principall and great than the first, alwayes hauing with them in companie and garde the number of souldiers aforesaid: sometimes they trauailed by lande and sometimes by water, whereas they saw so many rich thinges, which in respect to them, all that they had séene vnto that time was nothing. Of the which, although I haue had particular

relation of many of them, I leaue off heere the declaring thereof, for that of an Itinerario or commentarie I will not make a historie. But principally for that many of them doo séeme to be incredible, and will be more vnto those that haue not had any notice of the mightinesse of this kingdome.
               In the discourse of this their iourney, the cities and townes they sawe, were many and verie bigge, and all compassed with strong walles: and at one of them there was a mightie riuer, on the which was edified more than fiue hundreth engynes or whéeles, and they were made with so much art, that alonely with the violence of the streame of the riuer, that dooth force them, they water all the groundes there abouts for the space of two leagues and more, without any other helpe or humaine force.
               In this citie they were certaine daies in visiting, and complementes, after the which they were commaunded to goe vnto Canton, of the which in the two relations before, is made particular mention. So when they came vnto the Citie they were carried vnto the prison of the Thequixi, which is whereas are put such as are condemned to die, the which they plainely perceiued. There they remayned verie manie dayes, and the most part of them were carried vnto the tribunall seate of the Iudges, in companie with others that were condemned to die.
               At this time there was in the citie, the Tutan, who was the viceroye of the prouince: and the Chacu, who is the generall visitor, and that was at such time as was doone great Iustice for to cleare the prisons, whereas were thousandes of men, and some that had béene there more than tenne yeares. There was some day at that time that in the presence of our people, were brought foorth to be iudged two thousand prisoners, some to the death, and others to be whipped, and other to be banished with other kinde of penalties, according vnto the disposition &amp; rigor of their lawes. That day wherein they make capitall audience, they vse particular ceremonies, as shooting of certaine péeces of artilerie, and to shut the gates of the citie, not permitting anie to enter in, neither go foorth, till such time as that act and Iustice be finished, and many other things as hath béene declared in the first part of this historie.
               
                  The Spaniards being in the citie at this time of so great calamitie, it so fell out that the same time there was a gentleman of Portingall called Arias Gonsalo de Miranda, chiefe captaine of the citie of Machao (very deuout vnto religious men, and a friende vnto Spaniardes) who vnderstanding the great trouble and danger wherein they were, hee tooke order by all meanes possible to set them at libertie, and had so great care therein, that hee went through with his intent, in such sort that they were deliuered out of pryson, and from the great feare in which they were, and all by the intercession of this gentleman, who did vse so good persuasions for the loue he did bears vnto them, that he made voyde the euill opinion they had against them, and with compulsion to reuoke the rigorous sentence of death pronounced against them. I do not here in particular treate of such thinges as happened vnto these religious men the seruants of God, as well in the prison, as on their iourney, for that they were many, and to declare them, is requisite a long time, and to make a new historie.
               And although in the bookes before, haue béen declared the riches of that kingdome, and all thinges in particular, yet for the better certification, I thought it good (and not without purpose) to declare in the chapter following, some of th

                  se which the father fryer Martin Ignatio did communicate with me, vsing in the treating thereof so much breuitie that it shall séeme rather an Epilogo, then a new relation. And for a more verification of the truth, whereby better credite may be giuen thervnto, séeing that the persons who did sée it doo agrée in that which shall be here declared, and againe, for that the saide father and his companions did sée more thinges than the others, whose relations be alreadie set downe. The occasion wherefore they put confidence in them, and to let them sée and vnderstand many secretes, was for that they were sentenced and condemned to die: for without all doubt if they had vnderstood that they should haue returned out of the kingdom, they should neuer haue séene them, for they haue great care that any other nations should know their secrets, their manner of gouern

               CHAP. XVII. Here it doth intreat of the mightinesse, goodnesse, riches, and fortitude of the kingdome of China.
               THis kingdome is vnder the tropike of Capricorne, and stretched foorth on the sea coast, south west and northeast, more than fiue hundreth leagues: it hath on the partes south west the kingdome of Cochinchina, and on the north east, it dooth confine on Tartaria, a kingdome which dooth compasse the most part of the lande, on the other part to the northwest, there is an other mightie kingdome of white people, which is beyonde the kingdome of Persia, it is called Catay: there be in it Christians, and the king thereof is called Manuell. It is sayd of a truth that from the furthest part of this kingdome vnto Ierusalem is sixe moneths trauaile by lande,Sixe months trauaile from Ierusalem vnto China.
                   the which they vnderstoode by certaine Indians which came from that kingdome by Persia, whose testimonials were made in Ierusalem sixe moneths before, wherein was declared how that they had trauelled by Arabia felix, and passed the red sea. The other fourth part of this kingdome is compassed with a verie asper and high mountaine, which is fiue hundreth leagues vpon a right line: but nature had left certaine places open towards the northwest, which might be fourscore leagues little more or lesse, towards the sea of Iapon which is towards the Septentrion. The great riches of this countrie, and the great number of people that be therein, did supplie the same (as in the first part of this historie is more at large declared). And for that the king of this countrie séeing himselfe oppressed and troubled by the mightie Tartaro &amp; seemed that easily he might defende himselfe from him, in shutting vp of those gates which nature had left open betwixt the mountaines, he did shut it vp with the death of many thousande of people, for that hee vsed therein great tyrannie, which afterwardes was the occasion of his owne death.
               This mountaine, with the supply by man is the famous wall of the kingdom of China, that is of fiue hundred leagues long, yet you must vnderstande it in the manner aforesaide, the better to giue credite thereunto, for alonely f
                     •
                  ure score leagues were

made by mans handes with great industrie, and there is vpon it an infinite number of bulwarkes, which maketh it the more fayrer and stronger: But yet not so strong as is the other four hundreth and twentie leagues which were made by nature.
               Nigh vnto the same there is a great desert full of ditches and lakes of water,Great ditches &amp; lakes. which is the occasion that this kingdome hath béene conserued for more than two thousand yeares, as doth appeare by their owne histories, which they holde to bee verie true.
               All is imparted into fiftéene prouinces with that of Aynao, and euerie one of them hath a principall Citie of the which it beareth the name. In the middest of this kingdome there is a great lake,A mightie lake. out of the which proceedeth many great and mightie riuers, which runne through all the kingdome, and are so big that there sayleth vp and downe in them barkes, sregats, brigandines, and many other vessels of an other kinde of making. This great abundance of water is the occasion that it is so sertile, and so well prouided of all thinges, and againe the most part of their cities and townes are situated on the riuers side, so that by them the one prouince doth communicate with an other, carrying the one vnto the other, great store of marchandice and other thinges of great curiositie, and is done with little cost, for that all things are done very good cheape.
               This sea cost of this kingdome is the biggest and the best that is knowen in all the world, there is vpō it fiue prouinces which be these, of Canton, Chincheo, Liampon, Nanquin and that of Paquian, which is the furthest towardes the northwest, in the which is resident the king and his counsel with all his court ordinarily, and the most part of the men of warre that it hath, for that this prouince doth confine vpon the Tartaros their enimies. Some will say, that the kings ordinarie dwelling there, is for that it is the best and most fertilest of all the kingdome. But I beleeue (according to the saying of some of the Chinos) that he doth it not but because it is so nigh vnto Tartaria, and to finde himselfe there, whereas hee may supply all necessities which might happen vpon a soddaine by his enimies. In these riuers there are certaine Ilandes, the which are very profitable vnto all the kingdome, for that there is nourished &amp; brought vp in them great store of deare, hogges and other beasts, which

is the occasion that the cities are so well prouided and serued.
               But one of the things which causeth most admiration to thē that go to this kingdome, is to see so infinite a number of ships, and barkes that be in euerie port thereof, and are so many, that there hath béene a man in the citie of Machao that hath layde a wager,More ships in one port than in all Spaine. that alonely in the riuer of Canton, there be more ships and vessels than in all the cost of Spaine.
               One thing I may affirme, that I haue heard declared by persons of great credite, that haue béene in that kingdome (but in especiall of the father Ignacio whom I do follow in this Itinerario) that it is an easie thing in any one of these fiue prouinces that be vpon the sea cost, to ioyne together a thousande ships of warre and all of them (as they say in Spaine) dedicated for that purpose. The occasion why there be so many, is alreadie declared in his proper chapter. There are diuers opinions touching the greatnesse of this kingdome: but the most are conformable with the father fryer, Martin de Herrada, who like a good Geomatrician and Mathematician went nighest the pricke. This opinion is declared in the first part of this historie, whereunto I referre me, and in that which toucheth in particular, things of that kingdom, for that it is there declared at large as it was taken out of their bookes. But one thing I cannot let passe but declare, for that it séemeth woorthie to make thereof a particular memorie: and I vnderstood it, by the mouth of the said father Ignacio, which is that he doth affirme it to bee certaine true &amp; approued,They neuer had the plague. that euery day in the yeare one with an other (besides wars and the plague, the which in this countrio they remember not to haue any, neither do they find written in their histories for 2000. yeares, neither by famin nor any other accidentall occasions to consume the people) yet doth there die many thousands of people both smal &amp; great, in al the fiftéen prouinces of this kingdome: which is no small griefe vnto thē, who with a christian zeale doth consider this heauie tribute of so many soules that the diuell doth recouer eueri
                     •
                   day, and carrie them vnto his mansion or dwelling.
               All this kingdome is so fertile, as well for the ordinarie watring as also for the temperature of the heauen, that almost all the whole yeare they do gather fruits, but in especiall of wheat and rice: so that both the one and the other are very good cheape,

that our people in the discourse of their trauaile or pilgrymage did buy one pyco of rice or of wheate meale, which is fiue rou
                     •
                  s of Spaine for one ryall and a halfe, &amp; according vnto this rate, al other thinges beare their prices, as hath béene before declared. They say that in this countrie there be many elephants, lyons, tygres, ownses, &amp; other brute breastes, of the which these friers sawe verie few aliue, but many skins of them, which is a signe that it is of truth. There are many beasts whereof come the muske, the which are, of the tygres &amp; like vnto a litle dogge, the which they do kill &amp; put them vnder the ground certaine dayes, and after that it is putrified &amp; rotten, the flesh and bloud is conuerted into that swéete powder. There be also many cyuet cats &amp; little worth, a great number of horse. &amp; although those which the said friers did sée were litle, yet is it a common voice &amp; fame that in some of the fiftéene prouinces there are very good: but they were not there, so that they can not say they had seene thē. But the hens, géese, duckes, and other poultrie that are in all partes of this kingdome are without number, which is the occasion that they are of small estimation: the abundance of fish ia no lesse, as well of the sea as of the riuers, in the which they are conformable. All they that do declare of the thinges of this countrie, and the small price that it is solde for, is such, that the saide Frier doth affirme, and others that haue bin in that kingdome, that for the value of sixe marauadies (which is a pennie) may four companions eat very wel of flesh, fish, rice, and fruits, and drinke good wine of that countrie.
               In all this kingdome there are many mynes both of gold and siluer, and all verie rich:Mynes of golde &amp; siluer. but the king will not let them be labored but with great lymitation (saying) that which is in those mynes be in his house, and that they should procure to bring it from other kingdomes: yet notwithstanding the abundance is so great both of the one and the other, and so cōmon, that there is no man, although he be of an occupation, but hee hath in his house things both of gold and siluer, and other very rich iewels. They do estéeme for his value more the siluer than the golde:Siluer for his value more esteeme
                        •
                      than gold. and they say the cause is, for that the prices of golde are variable, as in Italie: but the siluer is alwaies at one s
                     •
                  aye and price.
               There are great store of pearles, but in especiall in the Iland

of Aynao, and great abundance of quickesiluer, copper, yron, steele, laton, tyn, lead, salt peter, brimstone, and other things which were woont to beautifie a kingdome, but aboue all, there is very much muske and amber gryce.Amber gryce
               
               The king of this kingdome, besides the great rent the which he hath, it is saide that he hath great treasories in all the principall cities, those which are the head cities of the prouinces, for the confirmance thereof, it was affirmed vnto the saide fryer for a verie certaintie, that in the citie of Canton, all the money that hath entred into the same for ye space of fiue hundred yeres (as well by way of the Portingals, as by those of the kingdom of Cyan,
                  Wonderfull treasure▪
                   and others their borderers, and all the tributes of that prouince) is altogether in the kings treasure house of that citie, which amounteth vnto by good account, many more millions than may be well numbred for to giue credite thereunto. It is as common for the people of this countrie to weare silke, as in Europe to weare lynnen, yea they do make their shooes thereof, some of satten, and many times of cloth of golde, of verie gallant colours: the cause is by reason of the great abundance that they haue therof, and is of so great quantitie that it is carried from the Citie of Canton vnto the Protingall Indians more than thrée thousand kintals euery yeare, besides a great quantitie which is carried vnto Iapon, and ordinarily more than 
                     •
                  iftéene ships laden for the Ilandes of Luzon.
                  Fleetes may be laden with silke. The Sianes and other nations doo also carrie away a great quantitie: and although there are carried away ordinarily as afore saide, yet there remaineth so great quantity in that kingdome, that many fleetes may be laden therewith.
               There is also great store of 
                     •
                  laxe, cotton, and other kinde of webstrie, and also good cheape, that the aforesaide Fryer dooth affirme, that he hath seene solde a canga, which is fiftéene fadam for foure ryals of plate. The fine earthen dishes that are in this countrie, cannot be declared without many wordes. But that which is brought from thence into Spaine is verie course, although vnto them that hath not séene the finer sort, it seemeth excellent good: but they haue such with them, that a cubba
                     •
                  d thereof amongest vs would be esteemed as though it were of golde. The finest cannot be brought foorth of the kingdome vpon paine of death, neyther can any haue the vse therof,

but onely the Loytias,
                  Sugar. ho ny and waxe. which be there gentlemen (as hath béen tolde you). There is great quantitie of sugar, honie, and waxe, and verie good cheape as aforesaide. And in conclusion I say, that they liue with so great abundance, that all things do flow so that they lacke nothing necessarie for their bodies: but for their soules which is the principallest, they do lack (as you haue vnderstoode in the discourse of this historie) God remedie the same at his pleasure.
               The rent which the king of this kingdome hath, is declared vnto you in a proper chapter of it selfe, so that in this I will declare that which the sayde fryer tolde me,A riuer that yeeldeth a million and a halfe euery yeare in sal
                        •
                     . and is onely of one riuer, which is called the riuer of the salt, and is in the prouince of Canton, and is worth vnto him euerie yeare a million and a halfe. And although the ordinarie rent the which he hath euery yeare, dooth exceede the greatest king that is nowe knowen in all the world in quantitie: yet in his treasories which be gathered together and kept (if it be true that the Chinos do say) in euery principall citie of these fiftéene prouinces, is more than a great number of kings togither haue or can procure, no nor come nigh vnto it by a great deale.
               All the cities and townes of this kingdome are walled about with stone walles, and at euerie fiftéene paces a bulwarke,All cities are walled. and without the wall commonly all of them haue a riuer or else a great déepe moote, wherein they may bring water at all times, with the which they are very strong: they doo vse no fortes, neyther haue they any, but onely ouer the gates of the Cities, towers (as hath béene declared) and in them is put all the artilerie the which is for the defence of that citie or towne.
               They vse many sortes of weapons,They vse hargabushes, bowes, and lances. but in especiall hargabushes, bowes, lances of thrée or foure manners, swords like vnto faunchers, &amp; with them targets. All the souldiers when they go to fight, they weare long garments down to their knées, very wel stuffed with cotton wooll,Englande, France, Spaine and the Turke hath not so many souldiers as this kingdome. the which doth resist the thrust of a lance, or a stabbe: all such souldiers as haue the kings ryall pay weare in token thereof red and yellowe hats, of the which there is so great a number, as well horsemen as foot men, that almost it is impossible to number them. And it is a cōmon opinion of all them that haue bin in this kingdome, and haue séene them, that all Spaine, France, and the great Turke hath not

so many as this kingdome hath. They haue amongst them captaines of ten souldiers,Captaines of few and many souldiers. some of a hundreth souldiers, some of a thousand, of ten thousand, of twentie thousand, &amp; in this sort to a hundred thousand. The number of souldiers yt these captains do leade, are knowen by certain ensignes that they beare. They muster and make show of their people euery new moone, &amp; the same day they do pay thē royally, &amp; their pay must be in siluer &amp; in no other money. It is saide by such as haue seene this pay, but especially the aforesaid father, fryer Ignacio, that they giue them a péece of siluer, which may weigh so much as a ryall and halfe of Spaine, and is as much worth there as foure crownes amongest vs, in respect of the value of all things. But both in the one and in the other kingdom, that day that they do receiue their pay, euery one must make a show of some act in armes, the which is done in the presence of viewers or mustermasters: and such as are found that doe not his exercise with dexteritie, they are reprehended and cruelly punished: they doo skirmish with great consort, and in that which toucheth obedience to their captaines, &amp; vnto the ensignes the which they do vse in their wars, they may compare with all nations of the world.
            
            
               CHAP. XVIII. This chapter doth treat of certaine rites &amp; ceremonies, and other signes &amp; tokens which be found, and do show that they haue had notice of the holy law of the gospell.
               SUch ceremonies as vnto this day haue bin séene amongst the people of this kingdom, are gentilicas, without any mixture with the Moores nor with any other sect: yet there is found amongst thē, that is a sufficient i
                     •
                  dition, that they haue had in some time past, some particular notice of the euangelicall law, as is plainly séene by certaine pictures which haue béene found and séene amongest them, whereof we haue made particular mention, the which they beléeue was knowen by the preaching of the Apostle S. Thomas, who passed through this kingdome when as he went vnto the Indians, &amp; from thence to the city of Salamina,
                  
                     Salamina where S. Thomas was martred. which in their language is called Malipur, whereas he was martyred for the name &amp; faith of Iesus Christ: of whō at this day they do remember in that kingdome, by the traditiō
                  
of their antecessors, who said, that many yeares past there was in that kingdome a man that did preach vnto them a new law. whereby they might goe vnto heauen: who after that hee had preached certaine daies, &amp; saw little fruit thereof (for that they were all occupied in ciuill wars) he departed from thence vnto the Indians. But first he left certaine disciples behind him that were baptised and well instructed in matters of faith that they might preach vnto them whē as occasion did serue for the same. In many places they do worship the diuell, only for yt he should do them no harme, and so the said fryer did tell me, for that he
                     •
                   was diuers times in presence whē as they did obsequies of certaine Chinos that lay a dying: and he saw that they had painted before ye dead man, a furious diuell, hauing in his left hand the sunne, and in his right hande a dagger, with the which he made a show as though he would strike him. This picture was put before him at the point that hee should yeelde vp the ghost, strengthening him, that he should put great trust thereon.
               And as the fryer did demand of them what reason they had to do the same: some of them answered, and saide, because the diuell should do no harme vnto the dead man in the other world they put his picture before him, that he might knowe him, and take him for his friend.
               That which is vnderstood of these Chinos is, that although they haue amongst them many errors of the Gentiles, yet with great ease they would be reduced vnto our faith, if they might haue libertie for to preach, and they to receiue it.
               When as the sunne and the moone is in eclypse, they beléeue verily, that the prince of the heauen will destroye them, and for verye feare they put them selues in that colour: the people generally doo worshippe vnto them, and beléeue verily that the sunne is a man and the moone a woman. And therefore, when as they beginne to bee eclypsed, they make great sacrifices and inuocations vnto the prince afore said, d
                     •
                  siring him not to kill nor destroy them, for the great necessitie they haue of them. All generally beléeue the immortalitie of the soule, and that in the other world they shall be rewarded or punished, according as they liued in this worlde in cōpany of ye bodie. And therfore they do vse to make in the fields sepulchres wherin they command thēselues to be buried after they be dead.
               
                  When they should be buried, they command to kill all their seruants, or their wiues, those that best he loued in his life, saying yt they do it, that they should go with them to serue them in the other world, wheras they beléeue they shall liue eternally &amp; die no more. They put with them into their sepulchres things to be eaten, &amp; great riches, beléeuing that they do carry the same into the other world, &amp; there to serue their necessities. In this error were the Indians of the Peru of old antiquity, as ye Spaniards haue séene by experience. There is in this kingdom many vniuersities, &amp; colleges, wherein is taught philosophie, both naturall &amp; morall, and the lawes of the countrie, for to learne to gouerne by thē, vnto the which the king doth send ordinarily visitors to sée &amp; vnderstand, the order that is amongst them, &amp; to reward or punish the students according vnto the desert of eyther of them. They are greatly ashamed when they sée any euil thing committed, although they bee not punished for the same, and a
                     ••
                   people that do permit with ease correction, as the father Ignacio and his companions did sée by experience, who going alwayes as condemned men to die, yet at all times when they did sée them do reuerence vnto their Idols or vnto the diuell or any other euill thing, they did reprehend thē with great liberty who did not onely séeke to hurt thē for the same, but did greatly reioyce to heare their reasons wherewith they did prohibite or forbid them. The said frier did tell me, that one day passing by an hermitage, whereas dwelled an hermite, who had vpon the altar in the same, an Idoll for his saint: before whom was there a Chino a principall man, worshipping the same, the said father without any feare went vnto him, &amp; began to reprehende him, and to spit at the Idoll, &amp; caused him therewith to leaue off his worshipping, whereof he was greatly amased both he &amp; all the rest of his companie, to sée with what boldnes it was done, and no harme done vnto him for the same, eyther they supposed that ye 
                  Chino did thinke him to be a mad man or else (which is most to be beléeued) yt God did worke with his seruant wherby he would giue him his reward for thatwhich he had done, in returning for his honor, in mittigating the furie of that man, &amp; to giue him vnderstanding, yt he was reprehended with reason. There are many Chinos conuerted to the faith as well in the Ilands Philippinas, as in the citie of Machao, and they baptise

of them daily, who giuetokens and outwarde showes to bee good christians, and say that the greatest difficultie for to conuert all the whole kingdome, will be in them that doo gouerne in the same, for they had néede of a particular ayde and helpe of the mercie of God, to bring them vnto the faith: for that they are had in reuerence and obeyed as Gods vpon the earth. Besides this they do giue themselues to all delightes,Giuen to delightes. that any humaine creature can imagine, for that they put all their felicitie therein, and doo it with so great extremitie, that it is supposed there is no people in all the worlde, that may be compared vnto them.
               For besides that they are alwayes carried in little chayres, and vpon mens shoulders, which are couered with silke &amp; golde, yet are they giuen much vnto bankets wherein they haue so many different sortes of meates, as their appetites doo require. And it is greatly to bee maruailed at,Their womē are chast, but their men are vicious. that the women of this kingdome are marueilous chast and secret as any whatsoeuer, and to the contrarie the men are as vicious, but in especiall the Lords and Gouernors: and for that our faith do reprehend with rigor and terror the excesse of these thinges, it is to be beleeued that it will be a great impediment to the entrie of the gospell amongst them: yet God may so touch them, and in such sort, that there will be no difficultie. Amongest the common people there will be no such impedimēt, but rather they will embrace with great content our holy law, for yt it will be an occasion to cleare &amp; set them at libertie from the tyrannie of the diuell, and from their Iudges and Lords, who do intreate them as slaues. This is the opinion of all them that haue entred into this kingdome, and haue intreated of this matter with the Chinos. They haue amongest them some good thinges, and woorthie to be imitated and folowed, of the which I will here set downe two, which are thinges of great purpose to my iudgement. The one is, that vnto none they do giue the office to gouerne, by no manner of wayes nor meanes, although they be suborned by friendship: but onely by his owne merites, and sufficient abilitie. The seconde, that none can be viceroy, gouernour, nor Iudge of a prouince or citie in the which hee is naturall borne, the which they say is done to take away the occasion of dooing any iniustice, beeing carried away or led by parentes or friendshippe.

All other thinges of this kingdome I do remit vnto that which hath bin before declared, for to passe vnto the rest, the which in this Itinerario is promised to be mentioned and declared.
            
            
               CHAP. XIX. This chapter doth treate of the Ilands of Iapon, and of other thinges in that kingdome.
               THe Ilandes of Iapon are many, and altogether make a mightie kingdome, yt is diuided amongest many lords: it is distant frō the firme land of China,
                  
                     Iapon is 300 leagues from China.
                   thrée hundred leagues, &amp; in the middest betwixt both kingdoms is the prouince of Lanquin, which is one of the fiftéene afore named, although going frō 
                  Machao a city of the Portingals, &amp; ioyning vnto Canton, which is of the proper China, they do make it but 250 leagues, trauelling towards the north, &amp; commonly they do account the same leagues frō the Ilands of Luzon or Philippinas, vnto the said Ilands of Iapon: whereunto they may go by noua hispania, for yt it is the better &amp; surer nauigation, and shorter voyage, for according vnto the reckoning of the pylots that do nauigate those seas, they make it no more thē 1750. leagues, which is not halfe of that which the Portingals make in their nauigation.
               These Ilands are many (as afore said) yet are they populared with much people, who in their bodies &amp; faces differ very little frō the Chinos, although not so politike: by the which it séemed to be true, yt which is found written in the histories of the kingdom of China, saying that these Iapones in old time were Chinas, &amp; that they came from that mightie kingdome vnto these Ilands, wheras they do now diuell for this occasion folowing. A kinsman of a king of China, a man of great countenance and valour, hauing conceiued within his brest, for to kill the king, &amp; thereby to make himselfe lorde of the countrie, the better to put this in execution, he gaue to vnderstand of his euill intent vnto others of his friends, requesting their fauour to execute ye same, promising that he would do his best. This being done, &amp; hauing them alwaies for his especiall friends, vnto whom it seemed no difficult thing, and againe moued with ambition, they did promise him: and for the better confirmation thereof, they began to prepare souldiers &amp; to haue thē readie against ye day appointed.

And for yt this their pretence could not be brought to effect with such secrecie as the matter required, their treason came to be discouered vnto the king, at such good oportunitie yt he might very well séeke remedie for his owne safegar
                     •
                   at his pleasure, vnlooked for of his kinsman, &amp; the rest of his followers, who were all taken with great ease. Then was it determined, by those of the royall councell, that all the traitors should haue their throts 
                     •
                  ut according vnto the lawes of the countrie: but when their sentence was carried vnto the king to be confirmed, (he vnderstanding yt they much repented, &amp; were sorie for their sin and treason that they had pretended against him) he determined to remedie the same with lesse damage, fearing what might happē by their deaths, so yt he cōmanded they should not die,The first inhabiting of the Iapon.
                   but be banished for euer out of the kingdome, with precise band, yt they their wiues, &amp; children, &amp; al that should come of them, should for euer liue on those Ilands that are now called Iapon, which were at yt time desert &amp; without people. This sentence was executed, &amp; the offenders did accept the same for mercie. So they were caried to ye said Ilands, wheras when they saw thēselues out of their naturall countrie, &amp; without any possibility euer to returne againe, they ordained their cōmon wealth as a thing to last for euer: directing all their lawes which were for their conseruation &amp; gouernment contrarie vnto the Chinos from whence they came. But in particular they made one, wherin they did prohibite for euer, their descendents to haue any frindship with the Chinos, &amp; did admonish them to do them all the euill that was possible, which is obserued &amp; kept vnto this day inuiolable, shewing thē
                  selues their contraries in all they may, euen in their apparell, spéech, &amp; customes: for the which there is no nation so abhorred of the Chinos, as is the Iapones, so that they are payd their hatred with the like. And although at that time the said Iapones were subiectes and tributaries vnto the king of China, and so continued long time after, now at this day they are not, but do all harme that may be vnto those of that kingdome.
               They haue much siluer, but not so fine as that is of our Indians, likewise great abundance of rice and flesh, and in some parts wheate▪ &amp; although they haue all this, with many fruits, and herbes, &amp; other things which be their ordinary victuals: yet are they not so well prouided as are their cōfines or neighbors,

and no default in the lande, for that it is verie good and fruitefull. But that the naturall people do giue themselues verie little vnto the tilling and sowing thereof, for that they are more affectioned vnto the warres, then vnto that: and this is the reason that many times they do lack prouision and victuals, which is the verie same reason that the naturall people &amp; others do report of them.In the Iapones are 66. kingdomes. There be in these Ilandes thrée score &amp; sixe kingdoms or prouinces, and many kings, although it may be better said, rulers or principals, such as the Spaniardes found in the Ilands of Luzō
                  
                  ▪ for which cause, although they be called kings, yet are they not, neither in their cōtractation nor rent, for they haue verie little in respect of the multitude of people. The king Nobunanga who died in the yeare 1583. was the most principall and greatest Lord amongst them all, as well of people, as of riches: who was slaine by a captaine of his, and punished by God by this meanes for his luciferine pride, for that it did farre excéede that of Nabuchadonozor, and was come vnto that point that he would haue béene worshipped for a God: for the which he commanded to make a sumptuous temple, and to put in it thinges that did well declare and showe his follie: of the which that you may sée how farre it did extend, I will declare here onely that which he did promise vnto them that did visite his temple.
               
                  A luciferine pride.First the rich men that came vnto the saide temple, and did worshippe his picture, should be more richer: and those that were poore should obtaine great riches: and both the one and the other, that had no successors to inherite their goods, should also obtaine them, and also long life for to enioy the same, with great peace and quietnesse.
               The second, that their life should be prolonged to 80. yeares.
               The third, that they should bee hole of all their infirmities and diseases, and shall obtaine full accomplishment of all their desires with health and tranquillitie. And the last he commanded that euery month they should celebrate a feast for his birth day, and therein to visite his temple, with certification that all those that did beléeue in him, and in that which hee promised, should without all doubt sée it accomplished, and those which in this life were faultie and did not doo in effect his commaundement, in the other they should goe the way to perdition.

And the better to accomplish this his will, he commaunded to be put in this temple, al the Idols in his kingdomes that were most worshipped, such as to whom frequented most pilgrimes: the which being done, he presently forbad rhat not one of them all should be worshipped, but he onely that was the true Fotoque and vniuersall God, the author and creator of nature.
               This foolishnesse did this proud king a little before his miserable death, and many other more, that I do leaue out for feare that I should be too tedious in this Itinerario. There did succéed this proude king in the kingdome his sonne called Vozequixama, who for that he is very yong, at this day it is gouerned by a worthy captaine called Faxiuandono.
               
               All men that are borne in this land are naturally inclined to warres and robberies, and it is vsed ordinarily amongst themselues, alwayes he that hath most power and strength, doth carry away the best part, and yet he doth inioy it with little securitie, for that as the prouerbe saith (he findeth a last for his shoo, or the length of his foote is found) and another commeth (when he thinketh least off) and carrieth away their spoile with victorie, reuenging iniuries the one for the other, without being requested thereunto: which is the occasion that they are neuer without ciuill warres, &amp; that séemeth to bée the influence of the clime of that land. This and the continual exercise in armes, and in robberies hath giuen them the name of warriers, and do terrifie all their borderers and neighbors.
               They vse many weapons, but especially hargabusses, swords and lances, and are very expert in them. On the firme land of China they haue done many suddaine robberies and thefts, and haue gone thorough therewith at their pleasure: and would haue done the like at the Ilands of Luzon, &amp; vsed for the same all meanes possible, but yet it fell out contrary vnto their meanings, and returned their backes full euill against their wils, with their hands vpon their owne heads.
               On a time they came vnto the Illocos, who with the fauour of the Spaniards (whose vassals they are) did desende themselues worthily: that the Iapones thought it best to returne vnto their houses and to leaue their begun pretence, with determination neuer to put themselues in the like perill, for that they had lost many of their companie. Not many yeares since

there happened vnto them the like disgrace in China, there went tenne thousande of them to robbe and steale, and at their going on lande, they did sacke a cittie with little hurt, and smal resistance, who with the content of that pray, forgot themselues and did not preuent the harme that might chance vnto them: the Chinos being offended did compasse them about in such sort, that when the Iapones remembred, themselues, they were in that case that they were constrained to yéelde vnto their enimies, who at their willes did repay themselues very well of the iniurie receiued, and a very good warning vnto all those that shall heare thereof, to slie from putting themselues into the like trance: so the Chinos were very wel reuenged of the iniury by them receiued.
               The faith of Christ is very well planted in some of these Ilands, by the good diligence and trauell of the fathers and Iesuites, but in particular, by that which was doone by master Francisco Xabier, one of the tenne companions of the father Ignacio de Loyola founder of the saide religion: hee trauelled with great zeale, in the conuerting of the saide Ilands, and that which was a great helpe vnto the same, was his holy doctrine and apostolike life, as vnto this day the Iapones doo confesse, attributing vnto him (next vnto God) the goodnesse that hath come vnto them by receiuing the baptisme, whome the fathers of that companie haue followed in all pointes, such as remained after his death, as also such as haue gone thither since that time.
               So that vnto them may bee attributed the thankes for the mollifying of such adamantine hearts, as are those of ye natural people of these Ilandes, whose wittes (although they be good and subtill) are naturally knowne to be inclined vnto warres, robberies and doing of euill: and at this day, being Christians, they do followe their euill inclinations, yet notwithstanding, by the good doctrine and ensample of the saide fathers, they are much better Christians then those of the Orientall or East Indians.
               
               I do not set downe here the number of those that are baptised in these Ilands, for that there are therein diuers opinions, as also for that the fathers of the name of Iesus or Iesuits doo distinctly declare in their letters. The Portugals say that in respect

of the number of people that are to bée conuerted, the number that are baptised are very fewe, and that there are many that are not, for lacke of ministers and preachers: the which may easily be remedied, in commaunding to go thither, more religious men of other orders, for to aide and helpe the saide Iesuites, the which shoulde be vnto them a particular content and comfort as I doo beléeue, as hath béene seene by experience in all partes of the Indians, whereas haue come religious men vnto places of their doctrine, for that the quantitie of people is so great that are in these Ilandes, that although there shoulde go thither many laborers of the Gospell, and all the orders of religious men, the one shoulde not be a let or hinderance vnto the other, and they shoulde all of them finde enough to occupie themselues, especially if that the successor of Nobunanga were conuerted with his subiectes. All the men of these Ilands are well set and well proportioned, and go well apparelled, although not in so good order as those of China: they liue verie healthfully and long, by reason that they doo vse verie fewe diuersities of meates: they doo not suffer amongst them any Phisitians, and doo not cure themselues, but with simples.
               They haue amongst them many priests of their Idols, whom they do call Bonsos, of the which there be great couents. Likewise they haue amongst them, great witches, who do ordinarily talke with the diuell,Many w
                        ••
                     ches, and are not a small impediment for thē to receiue the lawe of God in that kingdome. The women or wiues of these Iapones do kéepe themselues very close, and very seldome go forth of their houses, in the which they do resemble those of China much (as hath béene said) yet haue they many wiues, for that by their lawes it is lawfull for them to haue as they please, &amp; can sustaine, yet are they so prudent, that they do restraine themselues, and liue in great peace. Both men-seruants and women-seruants do serue their masters, as though they were slaues, &amp; they may kill them at their pleasure without incurring any penalty of their lawes: a thing far different from any good policie. Many other things more could I declare of this kingdome, the which I do let passe, for the reason aforesaid: and againe for that the fathers of the company of Iesus, haue intreated thereof at large and vere truely.
               
                  
                  Ilands of Amazones.
                  Not farre from these Ilands of Iapon, they haue discouered of late certaine Ilandes which are called of the Amazones, for that they are all inhabited by women, whose ordinary weapons are bowes and arrowes, and are very expert in the same: they haue their right brest drie, the better to exercise their bow. Unto these Ilands in certaine monethes euery yeare goeth certaine shippes from Iapones with merchandice, and they bring from thence such as they haue there: in the which time the men do deale with the Amazones as with their own proper wiues, &amp; for to avoide dangers that might happen amongst themselues they deale in this order following.
               
                  A strange custome.After that their shippes are aryued, there goeth on shore two messengers for to giue aduice vnto the quéene of their arriuall, and of the number of men that are in their shippes, who dooth appoint a day when they shall all come on shoare: the which day shee doth carrie to the waters side the like number of women, as they bee of men, but the saide women doo first come thither before the men doo disembarke themselues, and euery one of them dooth carry in their hande a paire of shooes, or a paire of slippers, and on them their owne seuerall marke, and do leaue them on the sands at the waters side, without any confort or order, and presently departe from thence. Then the men come on shoare, and euery one take the first paire of shooes that he commeth vnto, and put them on: then presently the women come forth, and euery one of them carryeth with her him who hath fallen vnto her by lot, to put on her shooes, and maketh him her guest, without any other particularitie, although it chanceth vnto the most vilest of them all to méete with the quéenes shooes, or otherwise to the contrarie.
               So when the monethes are expired set downe by the quéene, in the which are permitted the men aforesaid, they doo depart, euerie one leauing with his hostis his name, and the towne where hee dwelleth, for that if it so fall out that they bee with child, and be deliuered of a sonne, that hee may bee carried the yeare following vnto his father, but the daughters do remaine with them.
               This is very doubtfull to bee beléeued, although I haue bin certified by religious men, that haue talked with persons that within these two yeares haue béene at the saide Ilands, &amp; haue

séene the said women, and that which causeth me more to stand in doubt, is for that the fathers of the companie that dwell at the Iapones, haue not in their letters made any particular mention of them: therefore let euery one giue credite to this as liketh him best.
            
            
               CHAP. XX. They haue notice of certaine kingdomes borderers vnto these Ilands of Iapon, and it treateth of some thinges of them, according vnto the truest intelligence that hath come from those parts, &amp; of certaine miracles that happened in the kingdome of Cochinchina, that were notable.
               FRom the Cittie of Machao, which is inhabited by Portugals, and situated on the skirt of the firme lande of China, in two and twentie degrées, the aforesaide father Ignacio did trauell for Malaca, passing by the gulfe of Aynao, which is an Ilande and prouince of China, and fiue leagues from the firme lande, and from the Philippinas one hundreth and fourescore. It is a very rich prouince and of great prouision, and in the straight that is betwixt them and the firme lande, there is great fishing of pearles and Aliafar,
                  Great fishing of Pearles. and those which are there founde do in many killats excéede them that are brought from Bareu, which is on ye coast of Arabia, or those that are brought from Manar, which is another kingdome, from whence is brought many vnto that of China.
               
               This prouince of Aynao is very good and strong, and the people thereof very docible and well inclined. From this Ilande to the kingdome of Cochinchina, is fiue and twenty leagues, and from Machao, one hundreth and twentie fiue: it is a mightie kingdome and is in sixtéene degrées of altitude, and the one part therof is ioyned with the firme land of China. The whole is deuided into thrée prouinces. The first dooth enter forty leagues into the lande, and hath in it a mightie king. The second is more farther within the land, and he that is Lord thereof is a king of greater power then the first, and ioyning vnto the sun more towards the Septentrion is the thirde, the which is more greater and of more riches, whose king in respect of the

other two, is an Emperor, and is called in their language Tunquin, which doth signifie the same. Unto him be subiect ye other two kings: yet notwithstanding his mighitinesse, and called emperour, hee is subiect vnto the king of China, and dooth pay him tribute and parias.

                  Aboundance 
                        •
                     f silk &amp; gold.Great aboundance of silke and gold, and of other things very curious: all these kingdomes are at a very point to be reduced vnto our faith, for that the principall (he whom they giue title of Emperor) hath sent diuers times to Machao, and vnto other parts whereas are Christians, and haue requested to send them persons both learned and religious, for to instruct them in the law of God, for that they are all determined to receiue it, and be baptised: and do desire it with so great feruentnesse, that in manie citties they haue the timber ready to build &amp; edifie churches, and in a redinesse all other kind of necessaries for the same.
               There was in Machao a religious man of the order of barefoote Friers of saint Francis, who vnderstanding the great and good desire of this king, did send him by certaine Portugal merchants that did trade into his countrie, a cloth whereon was painted the day of iudgement, and hell, and that by an excellent workeman, and also a letter, wherein hee did signifie vnto him the great desire he had with some other of his companions to go into his kingdome to preach the Gospel. The which being receiued by the said king, and informed the signification of the picture, and of the religious man that sent it him, he reioyced very much with the present, and did send in returne of the same an other that was very good, vnto the same religious man, and a letter of great curtesie, &amp; did accept the offer that hee sent in his letter, and did promise that all that went thither shoulde haue good entertainement, and that he would presently make them a house next vnto his.
               This religious man, although h
                     •
                   had a desire to put in execution the kings will, yet at that time hee coulde not, by reason that he had but few companions: the which the king did vnderstande, and caused him to sende vnto the bishoppe of Machao
                  
thrée or foure letters, requesting him to send him the saide religious men, with certification that hauing them there, both hee and all the rest of his kingdome woulde receiue the faith of Christ and the holy baptisme: vnto the which letters they did alwaies make answere with promises that he would send them vnto him: but after because they did not accomplish the same, the king did complaine of him vnto certaine Portugall merchants with great griefe saying: this your bishop of Machao doth greatly lye: for that I haue requested him by foure letters to send me religious men for to preach the law of the gospell, &amp; he consenting vnto my wil, did neuer accomplish nor performe his word. Unto this day they haue not accomplished this desire, for the great lacke they haue of such ministers as they doo demande, &amp; are requisite in those parts, and cannot supply their want and necessitie, except they should leaue them vnprouided that bee already baptised. They doo driue them off with faire words &amp; promises, that with as great breuity as is possible, their desire shalbe satisfied. And this was the answere that was giuē in Machao vnto certaine messengers or ambassadors that were sent by the aforesaid king, for the same demand, the which was required with great instance. The which messengers for their comfort &amp; for his who sent thē, did carry with thē al such Images as they might haue, but specially that of the crosse, in which form &amp; likenes (as hath bin informed) they haue made in ye kingdome an infinite number, and set them in all their stréets, highwayes, &amp; houses, wheras they are worshiped &amp; reuerenced with great humilitie, as well for that it is in an ensigne of Christ, whose faith they do desire to receiue, as also for a notable miracle which happened in that kingdome, worthy to make thereof a particular mention, the which I will set downe here, in such sort as the ambassadors aforesaide did declare in publike before the inhabitants of Machao, when as they came to demande religious men for to instruct them in the gospel.
               There was a man naturally borne in this kingdome,A myracle▪
                   who for certaine occasions went forth of the same, and came &amp; dwelt amongst the Portugals, who séeing the Christian ceremonies and being touched with the hand of God, was baptised, and remained certaine yeares in the same towne, giuing outw
                     •
                  rde shewes to bee a good Christian, and one that feared God, at

the end thereof, hee changed his minde, and determined to returne vnto his owne countrie, and there to liue according vnto that which he had learned of the Christians, the which he beléeued to doo with ease, without any gainesaying or contradiction. Whereas when hée came thither, hee did obserue all such things as a Christian was bounde to doo: but amongst other signes and tokens of the same, he made a crosse and set it by the doore of his house, wherunto he did reuerence at all times when he passed by the same with great deuotion. His neighbours when as they saw that signe, a thing of them neuer séene before, and howe that that Christian did make particular reuerence, they beganne to mocke and scorne him, and the crosse, and pulled it downe from the place whereas it was set, &amp; did other things in dispite thereof, and of him that had set it there in that place, whose hatred and discourtesie was so much, that they determined in their minds to burne it, and to put the same in execution, who at the same instance did all miraculously die, I say those that would haue burnt the same, the which was séene of many other, who haue giuen sufficient testimony therof. And within fewe dayes after, all the whole linage of those dead persons did follow the same way, and not one escaped. This miracle being spread throughout all the kingdome, the naturals thereof did set vp many crosses in all parts.
               This they say was the principall motion that God put into their hearts for to moue them to demande for such as shoulde baptise them, and preach the holy gospell. Likewise a great helpe vnto the same was the declaration of the painted cloth, which the aforesaid religious man did send to the king. Since that time there hath gone vnto the Cittie of Machao certaine naturals of that kingdome, who being affectioned vnto our faith were baptised there: with the which, and with the hope aforesaid, they are all sustained, till such time as it is ye pleasure of God to send them the remedie for their soules, the which hée hath caused them to desire, which cannot be long, according vnto that which hath béene séene, and the miracles that God doth worke, the more for to kindle their desire, as the myracle of the crosse before spoken off, and others the which certaine Cochinchinos did declare in the Cittie of Machao, in anno, 1583. and happened the same yeare, and was very fresh in the memorie

of all those of the saide kingdome. The one of them was, that one of the Christians aforesaid went to visite a principall man that had the palsie, and kept his bed many yeares before:Another myracle. and conferring with his long sickenesse, he told of certaine myracles, such as he had vnderstanding that was done by Christ our redéemer, when that he was man amongst men whome hée redéemed: but in particular those which he did in the healing of the like infirmities, such as he lay sicke of: alonely with his deuine vertue, in touching of them with any part of his garmēts, or shadow. The Iudge hearing this, hee had a particular faith &amp; deuotion to him that had doone these myracles that the christian had told him, &amp; asked what his name was, &amp; what signes &amp; tokens he had: he told him that his name was Iesus of Nazareth redéemer of the worlde, the sauiour and glorifier of men. And the better to declare vnto him his signes, he shewed to him an Image or picture that he had of his, yt which was giuen him such time as he was baptised, printed in paper: &amp; of Iesu Christ when he ascended vp into heauen, the which for lacke of Churches, and other of greater volume, hee should haue continually with him &amp; make his praiers thereunto. This sicke man tooke it, and fixed his eies thereon with so great deuotion and faith, in requesting him to giue him his health, &amp; that he would presently beleeue in him, &amp; bée baptised. At the same instant in the sight of them all, he felt himselfe whole of ye infirmitie that he had suffered so many yeares before, and neuer could find any humaine remedy for the same, although he had prooued an infinite number. He straightwayes willed the Christian to baptise him, vnto whome hée gaue a great summe of monie, the which hee receiued against his will, and spent it in workes of mercie, and with part thereof he bought a bigge barke in the which at this day he dooth passe people thorough a riuer, whereas they were wont to passe great perill and danger, and hee doth it for Gods sake, and receiueth nothing for the same.
               A fewe dayes after in another part of this kingdome, there happened another myracle of no lesser substance then the first, that is, there was a Cochinchina in the said citie of Machao, who did aske to bee baptised of a barefoote Frier, which after yt hee had catechised sufficiently, hée gaue it vnto him: and after a great time that hee had béene in his company, and had experience

of his Christianitie &amp; deuotion, he gaue him licence for to returne vnto his country, with a good token, that at his comming thither he would procure to augment the desire of Christianitie, the which God had begunne to kindle in their brest.
               This good new christian did procure the same with so great care, that he did profite very much (being holpen with the fauor of God, who made him his instrument) hee healed certaine infirmities, in shewing vnto the patients an Image of our ladie, the which he had continually about his necke, and had therunto great deuotion, and woulde declare to them with great zeale the Lords prayer, or Pater noster. His fame was so much spred abrode in all parts of this prouince, wherein he dwelled, that it came vnto the eares of a Mandarin, or principall Iudge of the same, who was many dayes in his bedde a leaper, both of handes and féete, and neuer coulde finde any phisition nor medecine, that could giue him his health, nor any other humaine remedie: who being verie desirous to be healed, hée sent 
                     •
                  or the saide Christian, and asked if hée would take vppon him to heale him of that infirmitie, as it was affirmed that hee had done by others of greater importance. The Christian saide hée would, then the Iudge did promise vnto him for the same, great giftes and rewardes, but hee made no account thereof, but oneli
                     •
                   requested of him for reward, that after hee should bee hole, that he would be baptised and become a Christian: the which he did accept, and principally he shewed vnto him the Image that hée had of our lady, saying: If thou wilt beléeue in this lady, that is heere ingraued, and in her most holy sonne Iesus Christ the redéemer of the whole world, thou shalt presently be made hole. This Mandarin or Iudge did beholde the same with great attention, and thought on the words which he had heard spoken. And in determining with himselfe to beléeue the same, at the very point that he did put it in execution, he was healed of al his infirmitie, a thing which caused great admiration in all that prouince.
               These myracles and that of the crosse, in a short time being knowne abrode, haue caused such a desire vnto the inhabitants of that kingdome to become Christians, that by all manner of meanes possible they do procure the same: the which is not followed for lacke of ministers, as aforesaid, and is no smal griefe

vnto them that Christianly doo put themselues to consider how the diuel our aduersary doth carry vnto his infernal mansion, those soules which séeme to bee well disposed for to inioy the benefite of God, and his eternal goodnesse: all the which is for lacke of ministers, and not for any other default. God remedie the same for his mercies sake.
               The said father Ignacio (whom as I haue said, I do follow in many things of this Itinerario) did tell me, that as he passed by this kingdome for to go vnto Spaine, he saw the deuotion of the people thereof, and the great desire they had to bee Christians, and how that the people were ready and bent for to receiue the holy Gospell, very humble and of good vnderstanding. Hee would haue tarried for to baptise them, and would haue done it, onely for charity and compassion, séeing with what deuotion they did demand the same, and the great number of soules that were condemned: but hee was constrained by force to go vnto Malaca, and againe it séemed vnto him, that amongst so many people, his smal force might do little good: and that it were better for him to go vnto Spaine, and to procure more companions to helpe him, as he did, and returned with them, and with many other rewards, of Pope Gregory the thirtéenth receiued: and he also receiued great fauours of the king of Spaine, and with great hope, that his maiestie will giue his particular aide, for to go thorow with this enterprise, which will not be of small effect. I do beléeue of a truth, that in small time all that kingdome shall bee subiect vnto the Catholike saith of Rome, and to be the gate, whereby to enter the lawe of the Gospel into the mightie kingdome of China, for that this of Cochinchina is vpon the same firme land, and their language and customes are almost in one manner.
               They are verie white people of this kingdome, and are apparelled like vnto those of China: their women are verie honest and shamefast,Their womē are honest &amp; shamefast▪
                   and their apparell is very curius and gallant. The men weare their haire dispersed, and doo combe and trim it with too much care. In all the countrie almost, all of them are apparelled in silke, for that they haue there verie much, and excellent good: the countrie is verie holesome, and full of old folkes and children, which is a sufficient proofe for the goodnesse thereof.
               
                  They say that they neuer had amongst them neither pestilence nor hunger,They neuer had plague, pestilence nor hunger. which is the like as we haue said of the kingdome of China.
               
               Let him that can, do it in such sort that so great and infinite a number of soules that at this day are vnder the tyranny of the diuell, may see them in the Christian libertie, and in the other life inioy their creator.
            
            
               CHAP. XXI. In this chapter is declared of such kingdomes as are adioyning vnto that of Cochinchina, and of some notable thinges in them, with the rites and customes of the inhabitants.
               
                  The kingdome of Champa Rich of drugs.NIgh vnto this kingdome of Cochinchina, there is another called Champa, that although it be poore of gold and siluer, yet is it very rich of drugges and gallant wood, and great stoare of prouision. This kingdome is very great and full of people, &amp; they somewhat whiter then those of Cochinchina, they are as nigh &amp; as willing to become Christians as their neighbors but for the performance thereof, they doo lacke that which the other doo. They haue the same lawes and ceremonies as well the one as the other, and are all Idolaters, and doo worship the second causes, in the same order as the Chinos do, vnto whom likewise they do make one manner of acknowledging.
               From this Iland you may go with ease vnto Malaca, leauing on the right hand a kingdome which is called Camboia,
                  The kingdome of C
                           •
                        mboia.
                   the which is great &amp; very full of people, and all of them affectioned to go to sea, and nauigation, by reason whereof they haue an infinite number of vessels: It is a very fertill country, with great stoare of prouision: there are Elephants in great number &amp; Abadas, which is a kind of beast so big as two great buls, and hath vppon his snowt a little horne. At this day there is one of them at Madrid, the which was brought out of the Indians to his maiesty, and many do go to sée it for a strange thing, and neuer the like séene in Europe, whose skinne is so hard (according vnto the report) that no man although he be of great force and strength can passe it with a thrust. Some haue saide that it is an Unicorne, but I take it for the contrarie, and they are

of my opinion almost all those that haue béene in those partes, and haue séene the true Unicorne.
               In this kingdome there is a religious man of the order of S. Dominicke, called frier Siluester, whome God did carrie into those parts for to remedy the soules that are therein: hee dooth imploy himselfe to learne their naturall language, and to preach the holy gospell in the same tongue, and hath them likewise prepared, that if he had any companions for to help hym, they should obtayne much fruite for the heauens: he hath sent and requested for some vnto the India of Portingall, but they would neuer send him anie, peraduenture by some sinister information, by men which the diuell doth marke as instruments, for to stay and let the saluation of those soules, for euer to remayne in his tirannicall power. This fryer did write a letter vnto Malaca vnto fryer Martin Ignacio, and vnto o
                     •
                  her religious men, intirely requesting them for the loue of God, to giue such order that hee might be holpen with some religious men, of what order soeuer, with certification that therein they shall doe great seruice vnto God, and put remedie in those soules, whome he dare not baptise, for feare that after lacking the euangelical refreshing, to water and cherish them, they returne to bring forth that euill fruit of Idolatrie. This petition did not take effect according to his desire, for yt there was not to serue his turne, nor any that was vnoccupied. They vnderstood of him that brought this letter, that the king of that kingdome had in great veneration the sayd father Siluestro, in so ample manner, as was the patriarck Ioseph in Egipt: hee had in all that kingdome the seconde place, and euery time that the king would speak with him, he gaue him a chaire: and gaue him great priuiledges, and licence for to preach the holy gospell throughout all the kingdome without any contradiction, and for to edifie the churches and all other thinges whatsoeuer he thought necessarie: this king himselfe helping thereunto, by giuing of great gifts and charitie. He said also that in al ye kingdome there were erected many crosses, and were had in great reuerence. And for ye confirmation of the truth hereof, the aforesaid frier Ignacio did sée in Malaca a present yt the king of this kingdome of Camboia did send vnto another friend of his: and amongst many things contained therin of great riches &amp; curiositie:

there were two crosses very great and wel made, of a gallant wood &amp; very swéete, and all garnished very richly with siluer and gold, with their titles enamiled.

                  Nigh vnto this kingdome is that of Sian, in the hight of fourtéene degrées from the pole Artike, and thrée hundred leagues from Machao, wheras the Portugals do go to trade: It is the mother of all Idolatrie,The mother of Idolatrie. and the place from whence hath procéeded many sectes, vnto Iapon, China and Pegu. It is a flourishing countrie and well replenished of all such things as be requisite for to merite the name to be good. There be in it mani

The people of this kingdome for the most part are faint-hearted or cowards, for which occasion although they are infinite in number, yet are they subiect vnto the king of Pegu, who ouercame them long time since, in a battell (as afterwards shall be declared:) and they doo pay him ordinarily great and heauy tributes. They would be conuerted very eas

                  ly vnto the faith of Iesu Christ, and would leaue their Idols, if they had any to preach vnto them: yea, &amp; would subiect themselues vnto any king or Lord that woulde fauour them, and not vnto this whom now they do obey, for that hee dooth intreate them tyrannously. They haue amongst them many religious men after their fashion, who doo liue in common, and leade an asper and sharp life: for the which they are had of al the rest in great veneration. The penance which they do is wonderfull &amp; strange, as you may iudge by some things that I will declare here: amongst a great number that be tolde of them, there are none of them that can marrie, neither speake to any woman, &amp; if by chance he do, they arewithout remissiō punished by death. They go alwayes barefoote, &amp; very poorely apparelled, &amp; do eate nothing but rice &amp; gréene herbes, and this they do aske for charitie euery day, going from doore to doore with their wallet at their backes, alwayes with their eyes looking on the ground, wt such modesty &amp; honesty, that it is to be wondred at: they doo not craue their charity, neither take it with their hands, nor do any other thing but cal or knocke, &amp; stand still, till such time as they giue them their answer, or put some thing into their wallets. It is told them for a truth, that many times for penance they

do put themselues starke naked in the heate of the sunne, which is there very great, for that ye country is in twenty sixe degrees of the Equinoctiall, whereas they are much troubled there with gnats, whereof there is an infinite number, and is a thing that if they did passe it for Gods sake: it is a kinde of martyrdome of great desert. God for his mercy lighten them with his grace, that this which they do smally vnto the profite of their soules, may bee the occasion that after they are baptised, they may deserue for the same many degrées of glory.
               Likewise in secreat they doo great penance, and doo rise vp at midnight to praie vnto their Idols, and they do it in quiers, as is vsed amongst vs Christians. It is not permitted them any rentes, nor any other kinde of contractation: and if they bée séene to deale in any, they are detested and hated, as an heretike is amongst vs.
               For this kind of asper liuing (the which they do, according vnto the report) for the loue of the heauen, and that with great zeale: they are respected of the common people for saints, and for such they do reuerence them, and do commit them vnto their praiers, when they are in any trouble or infirmity. These and many other things mo be declared of them in like order, which may serue for to confound vs, that confessing, we do not obserue &amp; kéepe, hauing for the same our sure reward, not of humain interest, but that which God hath prepared for the good in heauē.
               The law of the Gospell in this kingdome would bring foorth much fruite, for that the people are charitable, and louers of vertue, and of them that haue it. This experience had the father Ignacio and his companions in China, at such time as they were prisoners, where there were in a city certain ambassadors from the king of Syan, who were bound to the court, and there they vnderstood that the Spaniards were sentenced to death for entring into that country without licence: they went to visite them, &amp; when they saw them with their asper habites and very poore, &amp; did resemble very much the habit of their religious men, they had so great affection vnto them, that ouer and aboue they sent thē good charity, the which was two bags of rice, much fish &amp; fruits: they did offer to thē al the mony they would desire, &amp; to ransome them in al that the Iudges would demand 
                     •
                  or them: in recompēce of this good wil they shewed vnto ye Spaniards, they

did verifie that aforesaide, that they are great louers of vertue.

                  NIgh vnto this kingdome of Syan there are two kingdomes togither, the one of them is called Lugor, and the other Patane, they belong both vnto one king, who is a Moore and of the linage Malaya, yet notwithstanding the people of these kingdomes are Gentiles, and do

                   vnderstande in them to haue great good will to become Christians, if they had anie to preach vnto them the Gospell.Gold, pepper and drugs. The lande is very rich of golde, Pepper and of drugges, but the people faint hearted and cowards, and for little▪ for which occasion they are more giuen vnto thinges of contentment and pleasure, then vnto wars or brawlings.
               
                  The kingdomes of Paon and Ior.
                  At the ende of this kingdome is the straite of Malaca, in the which there are two small kingdomes, the one of them is called Paon and the other Ior: the people of the first are the most traiterous that are in all the whole worlde, as the Portugals haue many times experimented, and those of the second kingdome: sometimes they are in peace, and sometimes in warre with the said Portugals. They will haue peace when they do sée themselues in necessity of the same, but war ordinarily. These two kingdomes are halfe Moores, by reason whereof it séemeth that with an euil wil they wil be reduced vnto the law of the gospel, if that by the help of God they be not mollified of their hearts.
               This straight of Malaca is vnder the Equinoctiall line, and is accounted from the kingdome of Cochinchina vnto it,The straight of Malaca is vnder the l

successe thereof our people did attribute it more vnto the iust iudgement of God than vnto the storme, for that according as they were informed, they had committed grieuous offences, at the time when she sanke: for being very nigh with his shippe in the which he went, and many other more, they felt not, neither had any suspition of any danger. From this straight to go vnto Malaca, you coast alongest the sea, fiue and twentie leagues: all which coast is full of great mightie and thicke woods: by reason whereof, as also for that it is not inhabited, there are many tygers, elephants and mightie great lysards, and other furious beastes.
               The citie of Malaca in our pole articke is eleuated from the equinoctiall onely one degrée: of ancient time it was the most principallest citie of all these kingdomes, and resident therein a mightie king a Moore, but after it was conquered by the Portingals, who in these wars did wonderfull things of great force &amp; courage: they did driue foorth all the Moores out of the same, and out of all the borders, and made of their Mezquita or temple, (which was a singular péece of worke) a high church, as it doth remaine vnto this day: there are also thrée monasteries of religious men, one of S. Dominicke, an other of S. Francis, and the third of the companie of Iesus, or Iesuites. It is a verie temperate countrie being so nigh the equinoctiall line: the reason is, for that euery wéeke ordinarily it rayneth thrée or foure times, (which is the greatest cause of health in all that countrie) and thereby is made woonderfull fruitfull, and with great abundance of prouision, but particularly of fruites, for there is great store, and some sortes neuer séene in Europe, amongst the which there is one, yt is called in the Malaca tongue Durion, and is so good that I haue heard it affirmed by manie that haue gone about the worlde, that it doth excéede in sauour all others that euer they had séene, or tasted: it is in forme like vnto a mellon, whose ryne is somewhat harde, and hath vpon it little white prickes which séemeth like haire, and within the fruite be partitions, which be of the colour like vnto maniar blanco, and of so good sauour and tast as it,A daint

                  owards the west, be ranke poyson, &amp; in effect, all cleane contrarie vnto the first. So that it seemeth here to be founde two contraries in one subiect, a thing which in philosophie they were woont to count impossible.
               This citie is of great contractation, for that there come thether all the kingdomes that we haue spoken of, and from many other more that are nigh thereabouts: but in particular a great number of great ships from the Indians, Canton, Chincheo, and frō many other places, likewise the Iapones carry thether their siluer to sell, &amp; those of the kingdome of Syan carry many things very curious, but especially cloues, and pepper of the Iland Malucas, and those of Burneo bring much sanders &amp; nutmegs, and those of Iaba &amp; Pegu, bring the wood of aguila, and those from Cochinchina &amp; Cham bring great store of wrought silke, drogges, and spicerie, and those of Samatra or Trapouana much golde and wrought things &amp; fine cloth of Vengalas &amp; Coromandel. All these and other thinges, make this citie famous and plentifull, as also very much enlarged of the Portingals that go thether ordinarily euery yeare, and traficke there.

               OUer against this famous citie of which so many thinges may be spoken of, is that mightie kingdome and Iland of Samatra,
                  The Iland of Samatra supposed to be the Iland of Ophir.
                   called by the anciēt cosmogrosers Trapouana, which is (as some say) the Iland of Ophir, whether ye fléet went which king Salomon sent▪ of which there is particular mention made in the scripture, in the third booke of the kings cap. 9. &amp; 10. and in the Paralipomenon cap. 9. that went &amp; returned againe ladē
                  
with gold &amp; rich tymber for to adorne the temple of Ierusalem, and of many other curious things, whose memorie doth remain vnto this day amongst the naturall people, although diffusedly. But not so much as those that haue it out of the holy scripture, neither so true. This Iland is vnder the equinoctial line, so that the one halfe doth extend vnto the pole artick &amp; the other halfe vnto the poole antarticke. It hath in longitude 230. leagues, and in latitude three score &amp; seuen leagues: and is so nigh vnto Malaca, that in some parts it is lesse than ten leagues. In this kingdom there are many lords &amp; rulers, yet he yt hath the greatest part thereof is a Moore, and is called Achan, it is one of the richest Ilands in al the world,The richest Iland in the world. for yt it hath many mynes of fine golde, of the which (although there is a law yt they cannot take out of thē more than is necessarie) yet there is great abundance carried from thence to Malaca, Turkie and many other places. There is gathered vpon this Iland great abundance of pepper and beniewyn of Boninas in great quantity, out of whose trées (whereof there is great woods) there come foorth so swéet a smel that it seemeth an earthly paradice, and was wont to be smelled twenty leagues at sea, for which respect the ships that saile that way do come so nigh the lande as they may to haue the comfort of that smell. There is also much Camphora and all kinde of spices, by reason wherof there commeth vnto this kingdome to traficke, many Turkes that come in ships and foystes out of the red sea, Also there doth traficke thether those of the kingdom of Sunda, Iaua the great, and Ambayno, and others that are there nigh vnto them. Unto this Iland came certaine Portingals to buy and sell, whereas they were all slaine, and some for the profession of the faith, for the which they are holden for martyrs of Iesu Christ, by the opinion of christians that doo dwell nigh, when they vnderstood ye cause. The most part of this kingdome are Moores, &amp; therefore they do abhor the christians, &amp; do make with them all the warr
                     •
                   they can, but in especiall with them that dwell in Malaca, whom many times they haue put in great danger of their liues, and losse of their goods.
               Running frō this kingdome of Malaca by the north &amp; northwest cost is the mightie kingdome of Pegu, the which is in bignes greater thē 
                  Samatra, &amp; equall in riches, especially of pearls and al sorts of stones, &amp; very fine christall: there is great store of

prouision and an infinite number of people, and the king thereof is mightie: to whō (as we haue said) ye king of Cyan doth pay tribute, because he ouercame him in a battaile which he had wt him, in the yeare 1568. according vnto the common opinion: the occasion was, that vnderstanding, how that the saide king of Syan had in his power a white Elephant▪ (whome those of the kingdome of Pegu do worship for God) the king sent to buy the same, and to giue for it so much as he would estéeme or value it: but he vtterly denied the same, and saide that he would not let him haue it for all that he had in his kingdom: the which caused so great anger vnto the king, that hee called together all the souldiers that he could make, with determination to get by force of armes, that which he could not by faire meanes and great ritches: in the which he did so great diligence, that in a fewe dayes hee had ioyned together an armie of a million and sixe hundreth thousande of men of warre,An armie of a million and sixe hundred thousand mē. with whome hee departed vnto the saide kingdome of Syan, which was from his kingdome two hundreth leagues, and did not onely performe his pretence in bringing away the white Elephant, but did also make the king tributarie, as he is vnto this day, as hath bin declared vnto you.
               The rites of the people and priestes of this countrie, doo resemble much those of the kingdome of Syan: they haue amongst them many monasteries of men that liue honestly, solitarie, &amp; with great penance, and people verie apt to receiue the holy gospell. For ouer and aboue that they are docible and of a good vnderstanding, they are men which do studie philosophie and are well inclyned and charitable, and haue a particular affection vnto vertue, and vnto such as they do knowe that haue vertue, and very friendly to remedie the necessitie of their poore neighbours.
               Going from this kingdome towardes the north is the kingdome of Arracon, verie plentifull of prouision, but few things of contractation or marchandice,The kingdome of Arracon.
                   which is the occasion that it is not well knowen to the Spaniardes, for that they haue not gone thether. They doo vnderstand of the naturall people, and of their customes, that they are very apt to receiue the holie gospell.
               From this kingdome alongst the same coast, you came vnto

the kingdome of Vangala,
                  The kingdome of Vangala.
                   through the which doth passe the riuer Ganges, one of the foure that comme foorth of paradice terrenall, the which being vnderstood by a certaine king of this kingdome, he determined to cause some to ascend vp that riuer, till such time as he had found the head spring or head thereof, and therewith paradice: for the which effect he commanded to be made diuers 
                     •
                  ortes of barkes both small and great, and sent in them vp the riuer certaine men (of whose diligence hee had long experience, &amp; were prouided with victuals for many daies, and gaue commandement that presently after that theyhad discouered that which hee desired, that they should returne with great spéede, far to giue him particular and true relation, with pretence foorthwith to go himselfe to inioy the things which he thought necessarie to be séene, and woorthie to be desired, of his trauaile, and in a place so delightfull.
               These men did nauigate vp the riuer many monethes, and came vnto a place whereas the water came foorth so softly and with so small noyse, which gaue them to vnderstande that they were not farre from the first head thereof, which should be paradice that which they went to séeke. They gaue to vnderstand that in this place, after they had séene so many tokens, &amp; comforted themselues with maruellous swéete smels, and aires of great delight, they thought verily that they had bin in the paradice terrenall. And more, when as they came vnto that place, where as the riuer did runne so peaceable, and the ayre so delicate and swéet, there entred into the hearts of them all, so great and extraordinarie ioy, that they séemed to be in the true paradice, and forgot all the trauaile that they had passed for to come thether, and of any other thing that did signifie paine or griefe. But when they did intend to go forwardes with this their pretence and intent, and thereunto did put all diligence possible, they found by experience that all their trauaile was in vaine, and howe that they remained alwaies in one place: and coulde not vnderstand from whence did come or procéede that contradiction, they could not find in the waters by reason of the peaceablenesse thereof.
               This experience being done, attributing it vnto a miserie because they could not get a shore, they returned backe againe by the same riuer, till they came to their owne kingdome, wheras

they arriued in a very short time, and gaue their king to vnderstand (who sent them) all as afore saide▪ and many other thinges more, the which I do leaue out for that I do take it apocripha. They hold it for a certaintie that the riuers Eufrates and Tygris are not far from this riuer Ganges, and it séemeth to be true for both of them doo discharge their currents or water into the Persian sea, the which is not farre distant from this kingdome.
               The people of this kingdome haue this riuer in great reuerence, which is the occasion, that they neuer enter into the same but with great respect and feare. And when they doo washe or bath themselues in it, they haue it for a certainetie that they remaine cleare from all their sinnes. Likewise this kingdome with great ease might be conuerted vnto the catholike faith as it séemeth, for that they haue amongst them, many morall rites, ceremonies, and vertues.
            
            
               CHAP. XXIIII. Of the kingdome of Coromandel and others his borderers, and of the citie of Salamina, whereas was and died the glorious Apostle S. Thomas, and of the power and riches of the king of this kingdome, &amp; the order of their buryinges, and other thinges of great curiositie.
               RUnning alongest the coast from Vengala, is the kingdome of Masulapatar, and certaine other kingdomes nigh vnto the same: they be all Gentiles as the rest of their borderers yet it is vnderstood, with great facilitie they would leaue their opinions. It is a kingdome that hath great abundance of prouision, and lacke of things of contractation or marchandice, which is the occasion that they are little knowen.
               Trauailing a little forwardes, is the kingdome of Coromandel whose chiefe citie is called Calamina, and nowe vulgarly Malipur, and is there whereas was martyred the happie Apostle S. Thomas. And they say that at this day there remaineth some of his relickes, by whom God did many myracles. The naturall people therefore haue a particular memory vntill this day of that saint.
               
                  This citie at this day is populared with Portingals and with the naturall people▪ there is in it a church, wherein is comprehended the house whereas was, and died the holy Apostle: this countrie belongeth vnto the king of Visnaga, who although he be a Gentile, he hath great reuerence and respect vnto the house of the holy Apostle, and for particular deuotion he doth giue euerie yeare a certaine charitie. There is in this citie two couentes of religious men, the one of the companie of Iesus, and the other of the order of S. Francis.
               From this citie of Calamina to that of Visnaga there wheras the king is, it is fiue and thirtie leagues by land. This king is mightie, and his kingdome very great and full of people, and hath great rentes. They say that onely the rent he hath of fine gold, is worth vnto him thrée millions, of the which he spendeth but one onely, and doth keepe euerie yeare two millions in his treasorie, the which according vnto the report &amp; fame, is at this day with many millions. He hath twelue principall or chiefe captaines, and euerie one of them hath the gouernement of an infinite number of people &amp; hath great rent for the same, for he that hath least rent hath sixe hundred thousand ducats yearely. Euerie one of them are bound to giue the king to eate, and all the people of his house, one month in the yeare: so that by this account the twelue captaines which are the lordes of the kingdome (and as wee might say) dukes, doo beare his cost all the whole yeare. The million the which he doth spend, is in giftes and in extraordinarie thinges. The king hath in his house, what with wiues, seruants and slaues, nigh about fourtéene thousand persons, and in his stable ordinarily a thousand horse, and for his seruice and garde eight hundreth Elephants, of whō he doth spend euerie day eight hundreth ducats. The garde of his person is 
                     •
                  oure thousand horsemen, to whō he giueth great wages. He hath also in his house thrée hundreth wiues besides a great number of concubines: they goe all gallantly apparelled, and with rich iewels, of the which there are of great estimation in ye kingdome, they do almost euerie three daies change newe colors of apparell. They do ordinarily vse colors of precious stones, such as are called in spaine ojo de gato cats eies. They haue great store of saphires, pearles, diamonds, rubies, &amp; many other stones, yt are in that kingdome in great abundance.
               
                  Amongest all these wiues there is one that is as legitimate, whose children doo inherite: and if it so fall out that she is barren, the first that is borne of any of ye other doth inherite: which is the occasion that they neuer lacke a successor in that kingdome.
               When the king of this kingdome doth die, they do carrie him foorth into a mightie fielde, with great sadnesse and mourning apparell, and there in the presence of those twelue péeres a fore saide, they do burne his bodie with wood of Sandalo, which is of a great smell, with the which they do make a great fire.
               After that the bodie of the king is burned and consumed, they throwe into the same the wiues that hee best loued, with seruants and slaues, those that he most estéemed in his life time: the which they do with so great content, that euery one dooth procure to be the first for to enter into the fire, and they that are last, do thinke themselues vnhappie. All these do say that they go to serue the king in the other life, whereas they shalbe with great ioy. This is the occasion that they goe with so good a will to die, and carrie with them the most richest and festiuall apparell they haue. Of this is gathered that they do beléeue the immortalitie of the soule, for that they doo confesse there is an other life, and that thither they do returne and liue for euer without ende. They are people that would be conuerted with the like facilitie vnto the holy gospell as their neighbours, if there went any thether to preach.
               Thrée score and tenne leagues from this citie, there is a Pagode or temple of Idols, whereas is a rich faire euery yeare, it is a very sumptuous building, and edified in a place so high, that it may be séene many leagues before you come vnto it.
               It hath ordinarily foure thousande men of garde, who are paide with the rent of the temple, the which is rich and verye good. There is nigh vnto the same many mynes of golde and precious stones, and that is taken out of them is rent vnto the temple. There is in it a pr

                  est of the Idolles, whom they call in their language brama, and is as the high priest in that countrie. All the people of the land do come vnto him, to vnderstand the doubtes of their manner of liuing, and he doth dispence with them in many things that be prohibited by their lawes, ye which he may do according vnto the sayd lawes, and manie times he

doth dispence with certaine of thē. But here one to be laughed, at, which is that when a woman cannot suffer the condition of her husbande, or is wearie of him for other occasions, she goeth vnto this Brama, and giuing vnto him a péece of golde,A strange custome. which may be to the value of a ducat in Spaine, he doth vnmarry thē, and setteth her at libertie that she may marry with an other, or with many if she please: &amp; in token of this she is giuen a marke with an yron vpon her right shoulder, so that with that alone she remaineth at libertie, and her husband cannot do vnto her any harme for the same, neither compell her to returne againe to his company.
               There are in this kingdome many mynes of verie fine diamonds, and are had in great estimation, and very well knowen in Europe. There hath béene found in them a stone so fine and of so great value, that but few yeares past, the king did sell the same vnto an other mightie king his borderer, called Odialcan for a million of golde,A diamond sold for a million of gold. besides other thinges of value that hee gaue him ouer and aboue. It is a healthfull countrie, with very go

                  d and fresh ayres, rich of prouisions, and of all other necessaries, not only for the humaine life: but also for curiositie and delightes that be therein. It is in fourtéene degrées towardes the pole artico. All the people therein are faint hearted and cowards, and for little trauaile, which is the occasion that they are nothing affectionate vnto warres, and is vnderstoode, with great facilitie they would receiue the gospell.
               Nigh vnto the same there is an other little kingdome called Mana, in the which there is a towne with Portingals, ye which is called in their language Negapatan, there is in the same a couent of the order of S. Francis, whose religious fryers, although they are but a few, do occupie themselues in the conuerting of the naturall people thereof, and it is to be beléeued that they shall reape much fruite and doo good, for they haue giuen showes of the same: for that about thrée yeares past the prince of that countrie was conuerted, by the preaching of the same fryers, who went now to receiue the holy baptisme with great and incredible ioy vnto the christians. All the rest of the kingdome (as it is beléeued) will shortly imitate him. In this Iland there are many pearls and aliofer, al very good, round and fine.

               THe afore saide father, Martin Ignacio departed with his companions from this cost, and went towards the Ilands of Nicobar, wheras are many Moores &amp; gentiles, al mingled the one with ye other.

                   They did not stay there, but presently passed to the town of Cuylan, which is inhabited with Portingals, &amp; from Malaca 416. leagues. This Iland is situated frō sixe vnto ten degrées vnder our pole, &amp; hath in longitude, thrée score and sixe leagues, and nine and thirtie of latitude. Of old
                     •
                   time it was an Iland much celebrated, &amp; in those partes had in great reuerence, for that it is saide that there dwelt &amp; died there in times past men, whose soules are in heauē, and are celebrated &amp; honored by thē of the countrie as though they were gods, with many sacrifices and orations, the which they do ordinarily. There come from other kingdomes bordering therupon, vnto this Ilande, many pilgrimes, but our people could neuer vnderstand the ground &amp; occasion thereof, neither how they liued, whom they doo hold for saints. There is vpon the same Iland a very high mountaine which is called Pico de adan which father Martin did sée, &amp; did heare the naturall people thereof say, that it had that name, for that by the same. Adam went vp into heauen: but what Adam it was they could not declare.
               There is on this Pico like a monasterie, the which the naturall people doo call Pagode: At one time they had therein an Apes to
                     •
                  th,Anapes tooth for their God the which they did worship for their God: and ther
                     •
                   came thither vnto that effect, some two hundred and thrée hundred leagues. It so happened in the yeare 1554. the vizroy of India, called Don Pedro Mascarenas sent an army vnto this kingdome, with many Portugals, with intent to reduce them vnto the obedience of the king of Portugall, all of that country, as they were before, who few yeares past, did rise against them, and tooke away and denied their fewter. The souldiers did sack that Pagode or monastery, and thinking to finde some treasure therein, they broke it, and beat it downe vnto the foundation:

and there they found the aforesaid apes tooth, the which they did worship, put in a chest of golde and stones, and carried it vnto Goa, vnto the said vizroy. When that this was vnderstood and knowne to other kings their borderers, and vnto him of Pegu, of this losse (the which of them was iudged to bee great) they sent their Ambassadors to the said vizroy, that they might in the name of them all, demaunde the saide tooth, the which they did worship, &amp; to offer for the ransome thereof seuen hundred thousand ducats of gold. The viceroy woul
                     •
                   haue giuen it them for that quantitie of gold which they did offer, &amp; would haue done it in effect, if it had not bin for the archbishop of Goa, who was called Don Gaspar, &amp; other religious mē, who did disturbe him putting great scrupulositie, &amp; laide vnto his charge the hurt that come by their Idolatrie, in giuing them the same, of the which he should giue a straight account vnto God. The which did so much in him, yt he dispatched away the embassador: without any regard of the gold yt they would haue giuen him in their presence, he did deliuer ye same vnto the said archbishop &amp; religious men, &amp; they before their eies did break it, &amp; burnt it, &amp; threw the dust thereof into the sea, which was not a little woonder vnto the said embassadors, to sée how little they did estéeme so great a quantitie of golde, and for a thing which they estéemed not, but threw it into the sea with so great liberalitie.
               This Ilande is fertile, peaceable, &amp; healthfull, and all full of woods, and there are mountaines very thicke of orenge trees, siders, Limas, Plantanos, &amp; Palmas, and many synamon trées, which be the best in all the world, &amp; of most strength &amp; effect, for ye which they go to buy, for to bring it vnto Europe, &amp; they giue it for a small price. Likewise there is pepper, but the naturall people did pull vp certaine hils that were ful of it, &amp; of sinamon, because they saw there came from farre to buy these two cōmodities, &amp; fearing yt it would be an occasion yt their country would be taken from them. It is a countrie of great prouision, &amp; doth bring foorth mightie elephants, and they say that there is many mynes of diamōds, rubies, &amp; other stones yt are called girasolis. In no part of this orientall Indies, there was none of so good a beginning in the cōuersion of the soules, as was in this Iland, for that certaine religious friers of the order of S. Francis did labor very much, and did baptise in a few daies more than fiftie

thousand soules, which gaue to vnderstand that with a verie good will they did receiue the law of the gospell, and had edi
                     •
                  ted many churches, and fourtéene monasteries of the same religion: but few yeares past, a king of that kingdome, being weary of certaine things, which in all that Indians are very publicke. he forsooke the religion &amp; faith he had receiued, and did rase &amp; destroy many portingals yt where there inhabited, thrusting forth all ye religious men that did baptise, &amp; minister the sacraments. This euill king was called Raxu. Many of them yt were christened, &amp; content wt the faith of Iesu Christ they had receiued, detesting yt which this tirannous king had done, they went &amp; dwelt in ye company of the portingals, &amp; others did build a town the which is called in their language Columbo, whereas is a great number of them: vnto this day do indure throughout al that kingdom the crosses, in token of their ancient christianitie: alongst all the coast they doe vse many Galiotas or gallyes, &amp; goe with them, robbing and spoyling al thereaboutes. The naturall people doo say, that with a good will they would againe returne and receiue the law of the gospell, if they had it there preached. From this Iland after they had passed a little gulfe, they came vpon the coast of a kingdome called Tutucuriu, and ran all alongest the cost of the same, running from the cape of Comerin to Cuylan. Here there is a Pagode or temple of their gods very great and rich, thether come all the Gentiles of that kingdom, at certain feasts in ye yeare with great deuotion: there is in is it a triumphant chariot, so great that 20. horse cannot mooue it, they bring it foorth in publike vpō their festiual daies, &amp; is carried by elephants, &amp; by an infinite number of men, who voluntarily do hale and pull at certaine roapes yt are made fast therunto. Upon the highest of this chariot is made a tabernacle very richly adorned, and within the same an Idol, whom they do worship: then immediatly vnder the same are ye kings wiues that go singing. They doo bring it forth with much musick
                     •
                   &amp; reioysings, &amp; do carry it a good way in procession, and amongest many thinges of honor that they doo vnto it, they do vse one so brute and beastly as the reader may well iudge thereof, which is,
                     
                        •
                      brutish vse. that many of them doo cut péeces of their owne fleshe and doo throwe it vnto the Idoll, and the other not contented with this, doo throwe them selues on the grounde that the

chariot may passe ouer them, and there they remaine all to péeces. Those that do die in this sort, they account them for great saints, and are had in singular veneration. Many other maners and fashions of idolatrie is declared of this kingdome, and more beastly than this we haue spokē of, the which I let passe, because I would not be tedious in this Itinerario. All the people of this kingdom, be very bad and ill inclined, for which cause ye fathers of the company of Iesus, that are in certaine townes nigh vnto the same, cannot as yet bring them out of their errors, although they haue put therein great care and diligence.
               Upon the same cost, &amp; a litle distant from this kingdom there is a towne of Portingals called Coulan, and 25. leagues further a citie which is called Cochin, in the which there are religious men of S. Francis, of S. Dominicke, of S. Austin, &amp; of the companie of Iesus, who haue there a very good studie, or seminarie, whereas they do bring foorth much fruite. Nigh vnto this citie is Santo Tome, whereas are many baptised and good christians, very abstinent and chast, vnto whom the patriarkes of Babylon doo prouide them of bishops: the authoritie where with they do it, is not knowen, nor whence they haue it, for that as I do vnderstand, the seat apostolicke did neuer giue it them. About the same matter, at this present there is in Rome a bishop of this kingdome, and one of the kingdome of Pimienta, with whom I haue talked diuers times, and is come thether to giue his obedience vnto the Pope and to knowe of him the order that his pleasure is should be obserued, in receiuing of those bishops which come thether by the cōmandement of the patriarke. In this kingdome there are many kings, but the principallest of them is he of Cochin, and next vnto him, he of Coulan, &amp; nigh vnto them are many petie kings, as is hee of Mangate &amp; Cranganor, and are all Gentils, although amongst them there are mixed many Moores. There hath bin found in this kingdome certaine Iewes, that haue gone frō 
                  Palestina &amp; those parts. There is in this countrie vniuersally, a lawe verie strange and little heard of, which is, that the sonnes doo not inherite after their fathers, but his brothers sonne, and the reason they giue for the same, is, for yt they haue no certaintie of their children, for that they haue no wiues proper nor appointed to thēselues, I promise you it séemeth to me, their reason to be as

barbarous as their law, for that the like inconuenience doth folow their brothers children. They haue many rites &amp; blindnes amongst thē, but one aboue all the rest, which is, yt in certaine feastes amongst them: they do vse bathes, &amp; after that they are bathed, they say that they remaine frée &amp; cleare from all their sinnes They haue many augorismes, of whom I will not intreat, for that they are not worthy of memorie. In this country is gathered most of the pepper that is brought into Europe, for which cause this kingdome is called that of the Pimienta.

                   but in them much people. In that of Cananor there are inhabited many Portingals, and religious mē of the order of S. Francis: it is a countrie in all things like vnto Cochin, for which cause, and for that they obserue &amp; kéepe one maner of customs &amp; rites, I remit the touching of this kingdome to the other aforesaide.
               Then forwards on there are other two small kingdoms the one is called Barcelor, &amp; the other, Mangalor, there be in them some christians: it is a good countrie &amp; rich, and hath it for certaine, that within a little time, they will be all baptised. From this kingdome they went vnto Goa, a principall citie, and inhabited with Portingals, &amp; is as the metropolitane of all those kingdomes: it is in fiftéen degrées of height▪ and is set from Cochin vnto it a hundreth leagues, this citie is situated in a little Iland compassed round about with water, and in compasse but onely foure leagues, and is deuided from the firme land of Odialcan by a mightie riuer. It is a good countrie &amp; peaceable, and doth inioy a very faire and pleasant riuer. In this Citie ordinarily is resident the viceroy of the India, and the archbishoppe: there are many Churches and couents, &amp; besides the high church, there are fourtéene parish churches, besides fiftéen hermitages that are within and without the citie: there be four couents, all very sumptuous, of S. Dominicke, of S. Austin,

of saint Francis, and of the company of Iesus. And without the cittie there is another of Recoletos Franciscanos reformed Francis friers.
               Nigh vnto this Iland are those of Salcete and Barde
                        •
                     ,
                  Ilandes Salcete &amp; Bardes.
                   there whereas the religious men of saint Francis, and the companie of Iesus haue certaine christian townes. Few yeares past, the Gentiles of Sancete did kill certaine fathers of the company of Iesus, in abhorring the faith, who died with great spirite and strength▪ so that I beleeue they went into ioy with God.

                   is in eightéene degrées and a halfe from ye towne of Chaul, &amp; beyond that Basayn, &amp; nigh thereunto Damaun: all these three townes are inhabited with Portugals, and the farthest is the prouince of Cambaya, subiect vnto the grand Tartar, or Mogor, by an other name.

                   is the cittie called Diu, whereas is a very faire and good fortresse of Portugals, with a very great hauen and sure, whose name doth extend thoroughout all Turkey.
               Two hundred and seuentie leagues beyond that,The cittie of Oromuz.
                   is the Citie of Oromuz on the 
                     •
                  oast of Persia, and in the same hath ye saide Portugals; an other fortresse, much better then that of Diu, and more inexpugnable: it is the biggest in al the Indians, but not of so great name as that of Diu. In this cittie of Oromuz they gather nothing else but salt, and that in great aboundance, yet notwithstanding▪ it is replenished of all that may be imagined, for that there is brought thither from Persia, and Arabia, great prouision and many other curiosities. They say, that from this place they may easily go to Uenice, taking their way to Aleph, and to Tripoli in Soria.
               
               All this coast of the Indias vnto Persia, is inhabited with many and mightie kingdomes, in the which there an infinite number of people: one of them is that of Odialon;
                     Odialon,
                   the which is very rich, and of much people, and all Moores. Nigh vnto this is another called Disamaluco, harde by the kingdome of the great Tartar, which in their language is called Mogor,
                  
                     Mogor.
                   the which, next vnto that of China, (I doo thinke) is the greatest in all the world, as may be collected in that which is declared of the mightinesse thereof, both in ancient and latter histories. On the other side of Oromuz is the kingdome of Persia,
                  
                     Persia.
                   whose king

is Xactamas, or Ismael Sophi, great Soldan of Egypt, descending by lyneall desent from the Soldan, Campson Gaurio, whom Selim, Emperor of the Tartaros did ouercome in battell, nigh vnto Damasco, in the yeare 1516.
               All those of this kingdome are Moores, although they &amp; the Turkes are as the Christians and heretikes, for that the Persians do follow the interpretation of the lawe of Mahomet, of certaine Alie
                        •
                     
                  
                  ▪ or doctors. And the Turkes go a different way, and do follow others. This contractation and different interpretation of the lawe, is the occasion that betwixt the one and the other: there is ordinarily cruell warres: and it is the great mercy of God, for that the Turke may not haue any space, to come and do euil vnto his Christians, or if he do come, he shalbe ouertaken with the Persians, his enimy the Sophi, and intrapped with all the euill they can do vnto him: who that although he be a Moore, and of the sect of Mahomet, yet he is a friend vnto Christians.

                  NEere vnto the straite of Oromuz is Arabia Felix, where as all the inhabitants are of the sect of Mahomet, and doo follow the same interpretatiō that the Sophi doth. So running a long by Arabia,
                  The red sea. you come straight vnto the red sea, or Arabico, the which hath foure hundred and fiftie leagues of Longitude, and in some partes it is of a mightie depth: the water thereof seemeth to bee red, although taking it out thereof, it is white: the cause thereof is, for that the ground vnder the water is of the same colour. By reason whereof, when as the sun doth shine thereon, it séemeth red, and thereby it hath got the name the which it hath vnto this day. By this sea, and by that of Basora, the great Turk doth carrie much spiceri

                   but the way how, is not for this place nor time. On the other side is the land of Abexin, which is that of Prester Iohn, a kingdome although it is very great, yet it extendeth

very litle on this coast.
                     Mazaubique.
                   From this kingdome or poynt going to the southwest is six hundreth leagues to Mazaubique whereas there is inhabitance of Portingals. All this coast is blacke people, gentiles and Idolaters, and is in fiftéene degrées in altitude towardes the south, and in the same maner are all the rest that are inhabited from Mazaubique vnto the cape of Buena Esperansa. They are without memorie of the preaching of the gospel, if that God for his mercy doe not take pitie on them, and put into the heartes of some to goe thither and to procure the remedie of so infinite number of soules.
               So after the sayd father had informed himselfe of all that is sayde, and of many other thinges more, which is left out for to euitate tediousnes, till such time as of them may bee made a particular historie, hee departed from Goa and Cochin towardes Portingall, and passed by the Ilandes of Maldiuia which are many, &amp; all are inhabited with Moores,The Ilands of Maldiuia.
                   nigh vnto the which they doe enter the poole Antartico, crossing the equinoctiall from the coast of Arabia, from thence they sayled with a faire winde till they came right against the Iland of sainct Lorenso, which is very great,The Iland
                        •
                      of S. Lorenso.
                   for that it hath two hundreth seuentie and fiue leagues of longitude, and fourescore and tenne of latitude. All inhabited with much people, very quiet and ciuill: the faith of Christ was neuer preached amongest them, yet I doe beleue that if it were, they would quietly receiue the same. Passing from this Ilande, they came vnto the Cape of Buena Esperansa, yt which is another very good Iland,The Cape o

                   whose inhabitants and dwellers are much like to those of saint Lorenso: it is in the temperate Zona, &amp; nigh vnto the straights of Magellanes. This Cape of Buena Esperansa is called by another name the Cape Tormentorio: it is fiue and thirtie degrées large from the pole Antartico. And from Cochin vnto this Cape, they put one thousand thrée hundred, fiftie and eight leagues, that way which they do ordinarliy Nauigate. When they doo passe by this cape, they were wont to haue great and strong winds. They go from thence to the Iland of S. Elena,

                   vpon the coast of Guinea, returning vnto the pole Artike, in foure and forty degrées in altitude (which was almost at the same place from whence he departed at his going foorth) after hee compassed the world. They passed in sight of the lande, and from thence they sailed forwards, and sawe other land vntill they came vnto Lisborne, hauing (after they had crossed the equinoctiall) sayled a thousand foure hundred and fifty leagues. So that after the aforesaid father, frier Martin Ignacio had made his account of all that he had trauelled, from the time he departed from Siuel, til he returned vnto Lysborne, in compassing the world, he found that it was nine thousand and forty leagues by sea &amp; by lande, besides many other leagues that he trauelled in China, and in other parts, of the which hee dooth make no account. All these leagues, are full of mightie kingdomes, and al or the most part of them, are subiect vnto the tyranny of lucyfer. God for his infinite mercy conuert them, and take pittie on them, as hee did when that he came from heauen vppon the earth to die for all, &amp; put into the heart of the king of Spaine, that amongst other good workes, the which with his most Christian zeale dooth intend and do, for to procure this, which will bee, so much vnto the glory of God, and great desert of honor vnto himselfe, the which he may do very commodiously, being as he is at this day Lord of all the Indies, and of the biggest part of all that newe world.
               This petition is worthy, that all we Christians doo desire of God, for that his holy name in all the world may be praised and exalted, and the sonnes of Adam, who for their sinnes are so dispersed and forgotten of God, and first beginning, they may go and inioy the happy and glorious kingdome, for the which they were created.
