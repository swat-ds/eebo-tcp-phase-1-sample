            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            EPIGRAMS and sentences spirituall in vers, of GREGORI NAZANZEN, an auncient &amp; famous Bishop in the Greke churche: Englished by Tho. Drant.

            To the righte honorable, the right reuerent father in God Edmonde Bishoppe of London, his very good Lorde and Maister, Tho. Drant wisheth grace and peace with long and ioyful life, in the euerliuing God through Christe our Sauiour.
            
               PErusing (right honorable) some of the Germaine wryters, and delighting in their pretie &amp; wittie verses, which to the texts and common places of holy scriptures they fitly haue applied: I founde no sayinges in them of a more quicke and godly sence, then those whiche they bringe oute of Gregorie Nazanzen, a Doctour of the Gréeke churche very wel learned, and very eloquent. Basil the great hath called him the Uessell of election, the profounde fountaine, the mouthe of Christe. Baptist Mantuan thus wryteth in his commendation.
            
               
                  Nunc Maximus ille
               
               Gregorius, cui dat diuina scientia tantum
               
                  Nomen, adest, hodie sacros habiturus honores
               Praesule patre satus (nam tunc id iura sinebant)
               Pastorale pedum gessit post funera patris
               By Zantina tulit faustos in menia gressus.
               Fama viri traxit varijs ex gentibus agmen
               Discipulorum ingens, illic Academica fecit
               Gymnasia, &amp; veteres illuc traduxit Athenas
               Nam quot erant toto orbe viri, qui scire profundos
               Scripturarum aditus vellent, &amp; mistica sensa,
               Et Cabilistarum latebras, ea littora adibant,
               Hieronymum fama est illuc veuisse trilinguem
               Et legis didicisse sub hoc arcana magistro.
            
            Amongest the reste his woorkes those sentences, and Epigrams which are called spiritual, are so in dede as they are called. They moue the spirite, in mouinge delight it, &amp; that with an excellent and choise kinde of delectation. Beinge thus brought into a booke, the booke is small: and, a pearle is smal likewise, but if it were much bigger or better, it would make me the gladder. That these fewe sayinges of Gregorie Nazanzen should be to your L. addressed (as the doinges of a learned father to a learned father) that is of congruitie: that from me to your L. that is of my dutie.

Neither doe I recke, or recken howe great it is, but howe great, and good I would haue it to be. Neither is it as a thinge in it selfe able to showe my good wyll: be it therefore as an argument that if I had better wherewith, I would haue ben right willing to haue shewed it. This humbly crauing I cease to trouble you. The .x. of Aprill.
            
               Your Lordships to be commaunded Tho. Drant.

               A ghostly question one of me did aske,
               Hast thou examined well thy selfe (quod I)
               Els doest thou but attempt a sinful taske,
               I am cleane purified (quod he) pardy.
               For who is he that hath not lost his witte,
               Newe oyle to vessels olde that wyl committe?
            
            
               Truste not lightly nor cauill muche.
               All manner wordes, or promis doe not truste,
               Against eache speache, in no wyse maist thou mell,
               But as through tyme, and place thou rightly must,
               Obey thou God, whom thou canst not excell.
               With mouthe all men most egrely doe striue:
               With manners neuer one that is aliue.
            
            
               A shame for a teacher to be reprouable.
               Or neuer teache thou any any worde at all,
               Or els with manners doe the same expresse:
               Least one hande buylde, the other make to fall.
               The better lyfe, of wordes it neades the lesse:
               We iudge a Painter so to be of skyll,
               Euen as his workemanship is good, or ill.
            
            
               Let Bishops, and Prelates geue light.
               O you that Lordlike rule so sterne, and stoute,
               Whose wealth, and worship stretcheth farre, and wyde:
               Take hede your lyncks, and lanterns go not out,
               Least wycked Prelates you at last be tryde,
               If light be darke, that was so bright, and trimme,
               What wylbe darkenes of it selfe so dimme?
            
            
               VVel doing is better then wel saying.
               A speacheles deede doth passe a deedeles worde.
               Without good deedes fewe haue ben caught vp hie,
               But those whiche finest phrase could not aforde,
               Doe naithelesse alday skale vp to the skie,
               
                  Not of the babling speaker god hath neade,
               But of the soule, that workes his will in deade.
            
            
               An acceptable offring vnto God.
               Most welcome gift to God is manners pure,
               Though thou to him couldst all the world present,
               The gift is not so good, thy selfe assure,
               Before all giftes good life doth him content.
               Geue him thy harte, as doe the meake, that quake,
               Thy coyne (an horishe bribe) God wyl not take.
            
            
               Make no vowe to God.
               Make thou no vowe not in the smalest thing,
               Thou guyles thy selfe to crake that that is thyne
               Which was gods owne, before thou diddes it bring.
               That from indebted vs we should decline,
               May warne vs well in this our mortall life,
               The death of Ananias and his wyfe.
            
            
               Mans life a market.
               Beleue this life to be a very marte,
               Great gaine there is if thou wilt plie a whyle,
               Eternall thinges for vayne thou maist by arte
               Exchaunge: and dearest ware for chaffer vile:
               But if thou slougge, and loiter liuing here,
               No other tyme, hereafter wyl appeare.
            
            
               The race of Christian life.
               Farre must we runne in this our drery race,
               But more shalbe our guardon great in tyme,
               Take hede thou hast not so the whole timbrace
               That of the whole thou mis with note of cryme.
               The deuill that would vs all from ioye exempt▪
               
               On both handes thus doth vse the good to tempte.
            
            
               Nor presume, nor dispaire.
               Truste not to muche, ne yet to much dispayre,
               The one doth make vs dissolutely to bolde,
               That other leades to euerlasting care,
               Correcte the last, and firme the former holde,
               Arighte: and freely fare vpon thy waye
               
                  Not enuie pale, not malice neade thee staie.
            
            
               Kepe on thy course in vertue.
               Proceade in thinges with good aduise begonne,
               To moue at first makes not a good mans state,
               But still to moue vntill the thing be done,
               For we doe counte him curste, and worthy hate,
               Not who a litil downwarde slippes awry,
               But he that falles exalted once on hie.
            
            
               All occasion of euill is to be shunned.
               A prety sparke doth rayse a mightie flame,
               A Uipers seade doth pestilently kyll,
               Instructed well, and warned by this same,
               Eschewe the smalest blot of any ill:
               For being soylde with blemishe very small,
               It draweth daungers manifolde with all.
            
            
               Knowe thy selfe. Good deedes better then golde.
               Thine owne affaires looke rather thou applie
               Then to thy neighbours busily attende:
               Thy neighbour he may some thing get thereby,
               The other would thine owne estate amende.
               Good deedes are better muche then fee, or golde,
               The one decaye, the other stande, and holde.
            
            
               Study godlines: Charme thy tongue.
               To sacred reade thy mynde deuout dispose,
               And to the rules deuine of blessed life,
               Thy tatling tongue let it not glide, or glose,
               In bablarie, or blablarie too rife,
               Whiche if at randome thou permit to walke,
               I warrant thee no wynner by thy talke.
            
            
               Temptation by thy eies.
               Our sight would gladly carie vs away.
               But by resisting tho it is represt,
               We are not booteys for syr Cupides pay,
               No idole myndes to him we haue Idrest:
               The baite was faire disguist, but we are gonne,
               
                  Of Satans snares, this certainly was one▪
               
            
            
               Temptation by the eares.
               Gainst wanton talke thyne eares with waxe doe shitte,
               And against all sonneites delicate, and softe,
               But what so for an honest man is fitte,
               That thou respectiuly must very ofte
               Both marke with diligent, and hedie care,
               And in thy saws and deedes the same declare:
            
            
               Temptation by the other senses.
               To odours womannishe, and fragrant smell,
               Thy selfe to tender touchinges doe not yealde,
               If these doe maister thee, what wilt thou well
               Deserue with hande in battayle champion fielde?
               The man hath his peculiar proper prayse:
               The woman hirs by other diffring wayes.
            
            
               Be not to liberal to thy belly.
               Still geue me, geue me, crithe the gredy paunche,
               And haue thou shalt, if well thou canst it saue,
               But if in dunge it passeth by the haunche
               Eftsones, what bootes it thee so much to haue?
               If thou dost kepe it long to make it more:
               Of dunge thou dost but treasure greater store.
            
            
               Laughter must be laughed at.
               Uaine laughter would be laughed at againe,
               And wanton laughter wyttely controlde,
               Immodest laughter oft insueth payne,
               To laughe whyles down thy chekes the teares at rolde,
               And better is a sadde, and pewly face,
               Then that which smileth smugge with smirking grace.
            
            
               Fauour and deformitie.
               True beautie doth adorne a godly mynde,
               And is to it a furniture, (no doubte)
               No furniture which tyme can chaunge from kynde,
               Nor such as crafte of hande can braue set out,
               The mynde not practisde doth deformed lye,
               As spieth he which hath an inwarde eye.
            
            
               
               Contempte of vanities.
               Pensiuenesse, pleasure, shame, and penurie,
               Ryches, honoure, authoritie of throne,
               Fearcenesse, and feare, let them both flitte, and flye,
               Without regarde to where they would begonne:
               Such thinges so tickle, fickle, vile, and vayne,
               Doe nothing moue a suerly setled brayne.
            
            
               The highnesse and humblenesse of good vvorkes.
               Be hie, not in thyne owne conceite at all,
               For that with sodayne swaye wyll cast the downe,
               If els thou buylst to hie, loke for a fall,
               Be hie in vpright lyfe, that wyl thee crowne:
               The more that thou exalted art on hie,
               The lesse stande thou on thy maioritie.
            
            
               Against vayne glorie and dissimulation.
               Nor thou eche prayse, nor too much prayse persue,
               Its wurst to be accompted then to bee,
               Flie praise which sprynges by gaie fonde facions newe
               (In case thou knowest not measure in degree)
               An Ape is he not still a very Ape,
               Though all men iudge he hath a Lions shape?
            
            
               Take not pryde in prayse, Prayse not rashly.
               If others praysing vardit make thee proude,
               Thou shalt be thought a prayser for to want,
               And rynging out an others prayses loude,
               His manners hauing yet seruaid skant,
               If his demenour be perceyued ill:
               Thy credit that will quyte destroy, and spyll.
            
            
               Pleasure not in deriding an other.
               Its better much to beare a scoffe, or scorne:
               Then thee thy selfe to skorne, and scoffe,
               If that vncyuilly thou byst not torne,
               
                  Thy vantage is with bourde to beare it of.
               So shall this mery mockyng kynde of glee,
               Unto the mocker moste vnpleasaunt bee.
            
            
               Triumphe ouer no man.
               Eere that thou commes to port, boast not thy gayle,
               For many men vpon the very shore,
               Haue wrecke their shippe, and sunke adown their sayle:
               And many midst thicke wrastling waues Ibore
               Haue safe aryvde vpon the sedicke coast,
               To laughe at no mans chaunce is wysdome most.
            
            
               Better clere conscience in aduersitie, then feare of iudgement in vvelth.
               So that thou lyvst in righteous manner here,
               Though vndersoote, and subiect vnto throws
               Prostrat to God in prayre, and conscience clere,
               If that thou byst, and him sincerely knowes:
               Its better then berest of grace to smart,
               Though all the worlde were framed to thy harte.
            
            
               Almesse measure.
               Whatsoeuer goodes thou hast the same disburse,
               That thou the lorde of life maist thyne possesse,
               That is not thyne which now is in thy purse,
               If that thou givst not all giue litle lesse,
               If so to giue doe cast thee into care:
               Be free of that which safely thou maist spare.
            
            
               Almesse dealing.
               From mouthes, and malice to the neady poore,
               If thou at any tyme doste ought withhould,
               Christe is thy debter it for to restore
               Who doth his heauenly kyngdome (more then goulde)
               Giue for a curste of bread: and all thy who
               Doe cladde the poore, doe cladde our sauiour (lo)
            
            
               As vve are affected to the poore, so is Christe to vs.
               A poore man came to me in miserable case,
               And emptie went away nought hauing gotte,
               
                  O Christe I wretched man deuoire of grace,
               Doe feare lest by the very selfe same lote
               I part from thee, he that doth small dispence,
               Receiueth small agayne departed hence.
            
            
               Godly pouertie is to be relieued.
               The substance smale doth make the harte full light,
               The poore man sighes, and sories much his case,
               But vpon God he bendes his total sight,
               This poore man thou deare in thyne armes imbrace:
               The Egle in her neast (we reade it oft)
               A litle straunger byrde wyll harboure softe.
            
            
               Pouertie better then ill gotten riches.
               Its better styll to lyue in hardest neede
               Then ryche to waxe by trecherie, and guyle,
               So sicknesse better is then health with speade
               That daungerous coms, and flittes within a whyle.
               With hunger no man sodenly doth die::
               Sinne kylleth, and condemneth by and by.
            
            
               A seruaunt is a felovve seruaunt.
               Maister and man, why doe we vse to saye?
               One head, one lawe we haue, and eke one iudge,
               Thy seruaunt thou thy felowe seruaunt aye
               To call and count doe then in no wyse grudge:
               So thou thy selfe a maister franke, and free,
               Of freedome thine shall worthy counted be.
            
            
               No shame to be a seruaunt.
               Seruauntes? why not? chiefly gods seruauntes tho
               Unto their maisters let them truly meane.
               A freman, or a seruaunt, ye, or no
               By that we knowe as he doth hym demeane:
               Our sauiour Christe that did infranch is all,
               To humble seruice did him selfe inthrall.
            
            
               True nobilitie.
               A shame it is not to be base, but badde,
               From those whose sithens longe are lodged in claye
               The glorie of thy gentrie thou hast had.
               
                  To helpe thy stocke not hurt it, is the waye.
               Its better thee to bee a godly brode,
               Then childe to those whiche godly be, and good.
            
            
               Christe thrists to be thristed after.
               Thou only God, and godly thinges desire,
               Who more will giue, the more that thou wilt take,
               Full of all giftes what so thou wilt require,
               And thrists for to be thristed for thy sake,
               In other thinges if happely thou doest misse,
               That doe, and kepe which iust, and measure is.
            
            
               Cast not alwaies to ouercome.
               Not alwayes looke to ouercome thy foe,
               Nor there about doe beate, and bruse thy brayne,
               He wynnes sometime that lettes the maistrie goe,
               And gettes at lenght more full, and noble gaine.
               The champion oft is daunted dead from hie:
               And he doth lyne that lurking lowe doth lye.
            
            
               Some losse bringes vantage.
               It vantage thinke to suffer any losse,
               That tree wilbe more fruitfull then before,
               That hath lost both his thicket bowes, and mosse:
               To goodes ill gotte who styll doth heape vp more,
               Let him adde fyer to tymber tunder drie,
               Or to his body adde a malady.
            
            
               Forget and forgiue.
               If vnto God thou byst indebted nought,
               Thy debter then in no wyse doe thou spare.
               But if thy debtes by hunderds be in brought,
               First to forgiue let be thy spedie care.
               So God in suche a charitable case
               Will recompence thee plentie grace for grace.
            
            
               In iniuries call to minde Christe his passion.
               If wrong receyvde doe wrast thy mynde to yre,
               Then call to mynde his woundes ibroched kene,
               What wrong had he vniustly for his hire
               
                  That once our maister must aloft be sene?
               His bleding woundes, and moisture of the same
               Will moist, and quenche the fearcenesse of thy flame.
            
            
               The chastning of thy body is a medicine for vice.
               Wyne, lust, enuie, and Satan are all one,
               Whom they possesse, the same they doe oppresse▪
               
               Teares, hunger, prayers, are deemed fit alone▪
               
               And meadsons meete the same for to redresse.
               So I those griefes doe vse for to asswage,
               So staye I them, and rule them in their rage.
            
            
               Sweare not.
               Sweare not, how then? how should I then perswade?
               With wordes, and deades which testimony cleare
               Doe bring vnto the wordes whiche thou hast saide:
               He God denies, which doth him selfe forsweare
               What neadst thou God prophane in mouth so rife?
               Make vs beleue thee by thyne vpright life.
            
            
               The summe of the lawe is charitie, and Christe his passion.
               What rule of loue haue we most short and true?
               As thou wouldes wyshe thy neighbours be to thee
               Suche one thy selfe vnto thy neighbours shewe,
               And such a one looke plainly that thou bee.
               Christes passion wayed well doe this conteyne
               In full effecte, compendious, and playne.
            
            
               A deare frende is a deare treasure.
               Thinke nothing dearer then a faithfull frende,
               Not suche as thou hast wonne to thee in wyne.
               But suche as trothe in troubles long did lende,
               The other will not seke for thee, but thine.
               A bridge thyne ire, and sone it ouer sende.
               Of frendly loue seke not to make an ende.
            
            
               Counsailers are necessary.
               The eye that all thinges spies, it selfe not spies,
               If it be blynde, then spies it not in deede
               
                  It selfe, nor ought, but blynde, and bluntishe lies:
               Of counsaylers we then doe stande in neade,
               For so the hande doth (pardie) neade the hande,
               And of the foote, the foote in neede doth stande.
            
            
               Backbiting, shamefastnesse.
               If thou the good, and godly doest obay,
               And listned hast, and leande to their behest,
               Let the vngodly say what they can say,
               Blushe not to heare them boldly gibe, and ieste
               If any filthie acte thou haste in mynde,
               Thinke thousandes stande before thee, and behinde.
            
            
               Good companie.
               Preferre the good before the wicked sort,
               The godly eke before thee godlesse route,
               Ill shalt thou be to ill if thou resorte.
               A wicked man no good can bring aboute.
               Suche one as gettes his goodes by wicked wayes.
               And by expending them doth gape for prayse.
            
            
               Frutes of fooes.
               Some profite I can take, yea by my foe,
               By shunning him, and dreading him eche where,
               I beare my selfe more wary where I goe.
               A bitter medson much we ought to teare,
               Yet of the sweate that makes the pallate faine,
               More cause we haue ofttymes for to complaine.
            
            
               Pacience breakes enuie.
               Honour the good, contempne the lawlesse lewde,
               For that they be inormouse lyvde in cryme,
               Whom prayse thou not whilst still they be so shrewde
               But them conuert in pacience, and time,
               This is the bountie most, the gift most franke,
               That thou canst giue, and worthy most of thanke.
            
            
               The measure of bounty.
               Be liberal to the vtmoste of thy power
               In tyme, and place so farre as store wil strech,
               Unto thy neyghbour do thy kind deuoure
               Ther of the reason is not farre to fetche,
               
                  To straungers who will thinke that thou art kinde,
               When to thyne owne vngratefull they thee finde?
            
            
               Blame our selues, not the deuill.
               Why doe we blame the Deuill? why doe we so?
               Why doe we morne, that he doth make vs sinne?
               Our liues at randone louse why let we go?
               The fault or hoallie we, or chiefe are in.
               In this our fleshe the fier we beare aboute:
               The feende doth blowe to make the flame flashe out.
            
            
               Dreames vaine.
               Beleue not dreames, let them not thee deceiue,
               Nor let eche fearfull fansie the agriese,
               If that thou happe some vision gladde to haue,
               Be thou not proude therof in any wyse,
               Suche folishe fraude, and fonde delightfull pelfe
               From Satan comes, euen from his very selfe.
            
            
               Hope the beste.
               To all thy deedes a prosprous ende propounde,
               For if that God to doinges whiche be ill
               No hinderer, but a suffrer oft be founde:
               The acte thats good (no doubt) he furder will:
               Though ill thee good doe seame for to appall
               Yet ill at length shall finde, and feele the fall.
            
            
               Learning and vvisedome.
               Wisedome is safer thing then prosprous lucke,
               Fortune doth faune, and sclender stroke doth yealde,
               But witte, and wysedome giue the stronger plucke,
               And only they doe rule in towne and fielde.
               Learning doth passe the brightest gift of mynde,
               A surer treasure shal we neuer finde.
            
            
               Stoutenesse, and courage.
               Be stoute, and sterne, but not in deades iniust,
               If thou wilt be gods dearling deare, and childe,
               But when thy case is good, and needes thou must,
               Let dastarde feare, and dreede be quite exilde,
               Theirs manye ils thats causers of decaye,
               
                  The hemlocke, and the Scorpion poyson paie.
            
            
               An olde man vvithout vvitte, a younge vvithout courage.
               A yonge man lesse of courage then an olde,
               An olde man then a yonge man lesse of witte,
               Unsitting and vnsemely both we holde,
               The age doth make the vertue kyndly fitte.
               Let him be wyse as sone as he is olde,
               And him before his age of courage bolde.
            
            
               VVorke and vvatche.
               Eche man in feare, must worke his sauing health,
               So muche the more the nearer death doth stande,
               Olde age wyl eftsones steppe on vs by stealth,
               The trumpet soundes our ende to be at hande:
               Be ready therefore all both more, and some,
               Be ready (O) the dreadfull iudge doth come.
            
            
               VVisedome better then riches.
               A droppe of lucke before a tunne of skill
               Giue me (so sayde a bolde curmogine chuffe)
               Phy (quoth the learned man) thou pratest ill,
               And harke how litle I esteme thy stuffe▪
               
               One droppe of skyll my harte wolde better please,
               Then of good lucke an hundred hudgie seas.
            
            
               VVe deny God tvvo vvayes.
               In worde and deede, our God we deny,
               (So shetteth vp my litle pamflet booke)
               The Deuill doth daungerous lurke vnto thee nye,
               Not farre from thee, but rounde about the looke.
               Thy soule to saue in present longe distresse
               Giue euer thankes to God, and blith him blesse.

            Against the Arians, Hipocrites, and disceuers.
            
               O Preistes that vnto God
            Hould sacred signes in handes,
            On whom commission great
            And charge of people standes:
            Betwixe whose onlye armes
            Godes workmanshippe doth swaye,
            You which both God, and man
            In one partakynge laye,
            Ye groundselles of the worlde,
            Of lyfe yelept the light,
            Ye workers of the worde,
            You blest to all mens sight,
            Christbearers that shoulde be.
            Now Lordes you set aloaft,
            With Pantackles, and moilles
            Your fete are feanced softe,
            To pageanes, and to plaies,
            Ye sawnter vp, and downe,
            On Theaters ye shine,
            The freshest in the towne
            Pretensed outward shape
            Ye conterféete, and steale
            But in Religion true,
            Pure inwardly to deale,
            
               You are from that as farre,
            As miserable stockes,
            As most infected shéepe
            Of all your scabye flockes.
            Playe on thou carelesse crue,
            As founde thou hast begunne,
            With countenance graue pronounce.
            Whiche lightly thou hast dunne.
            How so euer thou me calles,
            A person lewd, and lyght,
            And bids me get me farre,
            Exiled from thy syght,
            And dost with arrowes thicke
            Of opprobrie me smyte,
            Wherin as well I sée,
            Thou highlie dost delighte,
            Yeat what my mynde me giues,
            That bouldely will I saye,
            To the a folke vnkinde,
            My hart I will outlaye▪
            
            Euen as the water streames,
            If sterne the whether blowe,
            Compelled kepe beneath,
            And downe ther swellinge throwe,
            Then brymme again do rise
            With murmure, and with heate,
            And hie with spreadyng floode
            Orwart the feildes do beate:
            
               So I can not inhoulde
            This dolore in my brest,
            But out it forcing flyes
            Impacient of rest.
            Geue good leue for to speake,
            Forgiue what I auouche,
            If I your galled▪ myndes

            True pleadges of my téene
            Are wordes, and of my care,
            And though they bootlesse flye,
            And bussinge beate the ayre,
            Yet practyse proues it playne,
            We tell it as we finde,
            Talke presentlie doth ease,
            The payned pensyue mynde:
            Christs bodye, and renowne,
            (His flocke spreade farre abroad)
            Was quyet, whilst it voyde
            Of right Relligion boade,
            Nowe gods possession due,
            Addicted vnto him,
            It sperplith here and ther,
            As waues amydde the brymme.
            Or as the Pynetre frame
            With wanton Eastwinde strength:
            From skyes abatinge power
            To his Christ came at lenght,
            
               To humanekynde I knytte
            He God, and man was heare,
            And on his body bould
            A dreadfull death did beare,
            For our outragiouse synnes,
            Forth lardge his bloude did streame,
            That with suche pension proude,
            Our synnes he might redeme.
            Then readye shéepe to dye,
            His ministers he sent,
            Who throughe out many realmes
            His worde vpbearinge wente.
            And sweet accompted death
            That came from cruell hande,
            For with godes honoure highe
            It seamed well to stande,
            That all his seruantes true
            Attendant to his state,
            On his worde with their worde,
            On bloude with bloude should waite.
            But who our body shakes?
            Whence springs this mischeifes load?
            Howe commes the mone so darke,
            That once so brigome boade?
            Howe coulde that brockishe Boare
            Our Haruest so destroye?
            Who ardent angrye séekes
            Our kindred to annoye.
            
               Since first he Adame wrought
            From euerlastyng blysse,
            A forcye ferce assault
            To giue he doth not misse.
            Yet totally our kynd
            (Nathlesse his wilye pate)
            He compasse not with craft,
            Nor stirde them from their state.
            The sperklynge worde of God,
            That candle blasyng bright

            Upheaued by his light.
            The eager martires hartes
            Wer boulned more to die,
            The more that they the rage
            Of Tirantes dire did spie.
            Then Satan slye that spied.
            Our souldyers victores still
            Amongste their vnderguides
            Dissentious séede did spill.

            Her self on rockes doth throwe.
            
               So Cyties, houses, flockes,
            Ther absent guides do rewe:
            The waganers not skilde
            Their wagons ouerthrew:
            Whoseuer heares mongst vs
            What myscheifes craule and crepe,
            Will therfore blame, and banne
            The shepard, not the shepe.
            For manquellers were once
            Appoynted romes to lurcke,
            And romes assigned weare
            For Pagans Sabott worke.
            For seruyce of the Iues
            Erected was a place,
            Whiche kinges, and Rulers stoute
            Made euen with grounde in space.
            Howe well I will not saye:
            Nor do I honoure those
            That in suche wicked actes
            Their likinges do repose.
            The Lorde him selfe I knowe
            Their Temples doth detest,
            Those therfore layde it downe:
            So now the worst and best,
            The gentill, and the Iue,
            The Turke with vs is prest.
            In one Chrucheyarde we lye,
            Our Cophins cople neare,
            
               And in the Churche of Christ
            Our seruice now they heare.
            This venerable seat,
            This Temple for the wise,
            Where in ther whilome dwelt
            Most perfitt pure precyse,
            This pulpet wherin prechde
            Right angelles of the ayre,
            This chauncel, and this churche,
            So durable, and fayer.
            To wher God, and good men
            Were wonted to repayer,
            This once was very so:
            But now it is not rare.
            To se howe in they rushe.
            The doore standes open wyde,
            To intralles all they runne,
            Not one with out doth bide.
            I thinke some blast of trompe.
            Hath breathed vp alowde,A blast of the world to disorder the Churche.
            
            And calld in such likewise
            The multitude to crowde.
            Come hether lesse, and more
            That ride on vices backe,
            Put spurres vnto your horse
            Beware you be not slacke:
            Ye filthe, ye bellyes bigge,
            That lardge abroade do stroute,

            In browes, and forehead stoute,

            Ye trouncers with your tounge,
            Ye valyant beggers bragge,
            With wrangling that do wronge:
            Ye concyences slye
            Addressed to forsweare,
            Ye suytts of Sattens soft
            So solemply that weare,
            Ye that with gréedy iawes
            The people grate, and grind
            Ye that do steale the shares
            To other men assynde,
            Ye iarrers in your house,
            Ye breakers of your faith,
            Ye wily slylye pates
            That loue to take no skath,
            Ye that to noble men
            Can ducke adowne so lawe,
            And ouer loke the poore
            As you would eate them rawe,
            Ye tickle turnecottes, you,
            That ligtly wilbe gonne,
            And like the Lopster frame
            Your hewe to euery stone,
            Ye rouers in the fylde,
            Ye romers in the towne:
            
               Ye womens men aright.
            To squire them vp and downe.
            Ye mynions freshe, and shene,
            Of oders sweat that smell,
            In whom all manner synne
            Doth principally dwell:
            Come, come ye bouldly neare,

            For euery man is frée.
            Take ease with heade on hande
            And sturre not from your stall,
            All thinges that heare we haue,
            Are common vnto all.
            Ye shall not neade to doubte
            God streight will séende a showre,
            And now for your swete sakes,
            He Manna downe will powre,
            Eche man may fill his lappe
            And beare at will awaye,

            You thinke it for your paye,
            On Hoolydayes make bould
            The sacred breade to take,
            And let it rote at home
            And light the matter make:
            The ayre a common thinge,
            The earth a common thinge,
            
               The skye, and starres from hye
            Their common lyght do bringe.
            The Sea a common thinge,
            Our seates are common all▪
            
            Amonge the Prophettes sage
            Ther is a place for Saule.
            Wherfore come plowghmen rude,
            Come wrightes, and cobbers roughe,
            Come neat makers, and ye

            Let none to pastours harke,

            A sprituall care, and carke.
            Its better for to teache
            Then euer to be taught,
            And he lyues beast at ease
            That suffrantie hath wrought.
            Let him cast downe at once,
            The plowgh all from his handes,
            And let him cast awaye
            His hatchett wher he standes,
            The skynner let him caste

            The Hunter let him cast
            Awaye his huntyng gins
            The blacksmith let him leaue
            His hammer, and his styth

            Forsake it not for heate,
            Thrust whilles the stalles go downe,
            Thrust hardly whilst you sweate,
            The best Preyst that is founde,
            The most deseruinge prayse,"
            The cheife in all respectes,"

            Suche one as loues the skyes,"
            Desyrs the worlde to come,"
            This present doth despise.
            A seruant true to Christ,
            Who thoughe he be in steade
            Of liuinge creature here,
            Yet he in synne is deade.
            This is the portrayt first,
            This is the portrayt true,
            
               And so in tables ould
            His lynyamentes they drue:
            But he that lookes on you,
            Shoulde thinke an other thinge,
            Thexample of your deades
            An other thought would bringe,
            To paynt you in your kyndes,
            And fitlye in degrée

            Thus did the Trumpett sounde.
            
               Example agaynste rashnes.But Moyses makes me carcke,
            Who he alone did sée,
            Christ in a figure darke,
            And badde all others els
            Of great, and lesse accompte
            So highe not to presume,
            But bide beneath the mounte▪
            
            To washe their vestures pure,
            And tremblyng tarry still,
            To herken to Godes word,
            And listen to his will.
            Nor mell with flocke, except
            They would yeald vp ther bones,
            To dartes, to cragges, to rockes,
            To dashe vpon the stones.
            So Arons childerns endes
            For feare do make me quake,
            
               Who incens for to burne
            Did proudly vndertake
            At hoolye aulters pure:
            They felt ther dreadfull bayne,
            The sacred plott of blysse
            Became their place of payne.
            Thoughe they were Arons sonnes,
            And pleadges to him deare,
            Yet destnyes sharpe they founde,
            Presumynge foule so neare:
            So Helyes case his straunge,
            And heauie to behould,
            For likwyse on his sonnes
            Gods iudgementes iust are rould.
            Both for ther saucye myndes
            And beastly longinge luste:
            Whilst to the hoolye pottes
            Their handes vnpure they thrust.
            On Ely also selfe
            Was wrought Gods wrekfull ire,
            Of that vnworthy séed
            The worthy praised syre.
            For belly of his sonnes
            He had like bitter smart,
            Thoughe bitterly he warnd
            Them oftens to conuert.
            If suche offences smale
            Haue suche a soory méede,
            
               Howe ought outragouse crymes
            To quake, and stande in dread
            He also myser dyd
            That woulde with handes prophane
            The fallyng Aicke of God
            (Uncalde ther to) sustayne.
            God would no ryott rude,
            No dealyng so confuse,
            And therfore temples cloase
            For purpose he did chuse,
            O Christ, I wéepe, I morne
            Flat prostrat on my face,
            And almost is (me thinkes)
            Uncurable my case,
            In that I did forsake
            Still in my charge to toyle,
            Thoughe greuouse were (God wote)
            Myne agonye, and broyle:
            I fought with rampinge wolfes,
            I sought a drery tyme,
            With eatars of their flockes,
            With Pastours puffd with cryme.
            My mynde doth leaue the corpes,
            And hie it heuinge vauntes:
            Dyseasd with open wrongs
            And tost with raylinge tauntes.
            Christ ministers should be
            Most simple, myld, and mecke,
            
               But now with huffe and snuffe
            The prymate seates they séeke
            They brable, and they braule,
            They take outtakynge paynes,
            They do, and suffer all
            For griplenesse of gaines.
            As in a champion fild
            They warrelyke marshe, and men
            Right seruitors of Mars
            In bickeringes bragge, and fell,
            Their glory is in bludde,
            Their glosyng is of peace,
            Would god that Getteys plagues
            Uppon their pates would cease,
            Would God they guardon had.
            A nother sort dysease,
            With sectes, and frantike scysmes
            The east and weasterne seas,
            God is not now their God,
            But Paule, Apollo, Peter:
            Or he is eche mans God
            To him that semeth meter.
            For men, and not for Christ
            Good iudged must we be,
            So that our Christ in vayne
            Displayed was on tre,
            And nayled was in vayne,
            Forth whose thrise blessed bludde,
            
               Issued all our name,
            And all our worshippe good.
            Now Lust before our eyes
            A clottered cloude hath rould,
            And in vs Christian lyfe
            Hath caught a crasie could,
            Now auarice doth raygne,
            By stelth she clekes, and glenes,
            Nowe pride doth proule for prayse
            By lewde apparant meanes,
            Nowe enuie clappes her handes
            An others hurt to spie:
            Althoughe therby the worthe
            She wynne not of a flye.
            To what so they do preache
            They God protest before
            Yet they apertly partes
            Mayntayne, and factions sore:
            They speake not as they thinke,
            Ther saynges, and ther mynde
            Or selde, or neuer in one.
            Contunynge shalt thou finde.
            The woulfe in shepishe tyre
            A simple soule doth loke,
            They couer for the fyshe
            A mortall hidden hoke,
            Both those whiche haue no guides,
            And those which haue suche guides,
            
               Without, or with suche guids
            All into mischeife slids.
            Life hooly, or prophane,
            Life dissolute, or strayte,
            Gods word, and mans deuice
            Are déemed by one rate.
            One custome still we haue,
            And still is like to stande,
            That he that is the worst
            Best prosperse in the lande.
            The Lord confounde that soule
            That errors did inuent,
            That hatefull head that first
            Into the world them sent.
            To them the world giues place,
            To them gods selfe giues place,
            The wills, and féese of men
            They purchase thicke in space,
            Rewards are all their owne.
            Which shalbe ours at length

            Ormatchde with stéere, and strength.
            Our Iudges iudge it so,
            It ruleth what they say,
            Dame iustice from our coasts
            An outlawe is awaye,

            Gould, siluer, stone, and brasse
            An ownce, and dramme are one.
            A like the puddles vile
            And fountaines clere in stone.
            All thinges are nowe alike,
            All thinges are now confusde,
            As matter with out forme
            Which first (they sayd) was vsde

            The Amonittes of yore,

            Bicause they hurt Gods folke:
            And they which with their mockes
            Disquyeted Gods churche
            God signd for hewynge blocks.
            And tancards for to beare:
            Thus did the wicked spéede
            At Gods indifferent hands
            They had no better méede.
            But Leues ofspringe aye
            Prehemynence had great
            With in the temple they
            
               Were ministers in seate,
            The seruice they sustaynde
            The cuers on them did bide
            All offices of chardge
            Mongst them they did deuide
            Within and out the churche:
            Thus they did practise well
            In hooly deades deuout
            As then they did excell.
            We, we, (O death) to synne

            A wake from vyce (O world)
            Tyme now for to repent
            And God with hartie praier
            Is likly to relent.
            You shall haue happie helthe,
            You shall haue present ayde,
            If warned by my wordes
            In tyme you wilbe staide.
            But yf my whightlie heares
            And sawes you do dispies,
            If younkers Rashe and bould
            Yée iudge for to be wise,
            If some with deathfull noyse
            And foolyshe perlouse dynne,
            Do sott your sensles hart
            And of me conquest wynne.
            
               Our light I do protest
            To darknesse that doth turne,
            And Gods fyre puysant hande
            That shall make all to burne:
            I will not take their parte,
            I dare not be their mate,
            Nor of their rede peruerse
            Once will I knowe the state.
            We come not in one shippe,
            We sayle not in one Bardge,
            I will not walke their waye
            Nor sincke with them for chardge.
            Let them post out the race
            Which rashly they haue runne,
            And speadely dispatche,
            Whiche lightly they begonne.
            The helthfull arcke of Noys
            I laboure to assende,
            To skape that is to come
            Their doolefull dreadfull ende.
            I will steppe from their pathe,
            And voide the shenfull showre,
            That grysely hydeous plague
            On Sodome that did powre,
            In this our yearthly corps
            That Sodome hath a place,
            The visage of the wise
            With duste it doth deface,
            
               It rangeth vp and downe,
            It doth seduce the harte,
            And is the motiue cause
            From path to make vs starte.
            I hope to take suche hede
            To purge this Sodome out.
            That safely I maye smyle
            At stormes which lowdly route.
            With fixt intentiue mynde,
            And heaunly meanyng will
            Purposinge godly thinges,
            Not common with the ill,
            Unto the persons thrée
            (One godheade) I will fare,
            And to my sauior Christ
            Which sitts in iudgement chare.
            Wheare alle thinges shalbe ope,
            And euident in sight
            In Gods eauen wayinge hande
            The skole shall payse aright.
            And vprightlie and iuste
            Shall all be donne in sighte.
         
         
            The othe of Nazensen being made Bishoppe.
            BY Christ I swere aboue.
            With God coeternall,
            
               Begot before all worldes
            And not begonne at all:
            His Fathers image true
            Most like vnto the same,
            Which once for mans great loue
            From skyes dissendyng came,
            I swere, and swere againe,
            By Gods allmightful grace,
            That I no errors false,
            Nor fickle will imbrace,
            Nor that in other sence
            The sentence of the lorde,
            Ile chaunge, or with my wordes
            Make worse his precious worde.
            If of the trynall powre
            The honoure I deuide,
            Or if I fréet in neade,
            And from thy seruice slide,
            If I for vpmost romes,
            Do euer throng, or thrust,
            Or if me captyue drawe
            With corde suche longing luste,
            If I on mortall man,
            My confidence do laye,
            And on so weke a helpe
            My flotyue shippe shal staye,
            If that in waues of welth,
            My mynde be pufte with pride,
            
               Or if to soft delights
            My wanton hart shall slyde:
            If I a iudge assignde
            Right iudgment shall renye,
            Or if the higher rome
            Do make me loke more hie,
            If I treade not aright,
            Or cease from doinge well,
            If I delight to se
            The wicked beare the bell:
            If malice fréete my fleshe,
            If I do gibe, or skorne
            At any mans myschaunce,
            Or at my fooes forlorne,
            If fansie make me madde,
            If that my breast be blinde,
            If that my tonge doth talke,
            And tattle out of kinde,
            If rashlye I do hate,
            Or seke reuenge on fooe,
            If emptie from my house
            I let a poore man gooe.
            If I féede not those brestes
            That thrist for Christ his worde:
            Then other men regarde
            And loke on them (O Lorde)
            The labours ould, and great
            Which me haue ouer loode
            
               Comitt them to the wynds,
            To carry them abroade,
            This is my lawe of lyfe,
            The which if I imbrace,
            Nor thought, nor deade is myne,
            (O Christ) it is they grace.
         
         
            A spirituall dompe.
            In heuie hard affayres,
            The comfort of my greife,
            My keper trustie true,
            The prope of my beleife
            Was aye the Godheade bright

            Ariude at our rude cares,
            Whose word amongst vs hoasts.
            This blessed godhead now
            Eche wicked wight doth teare,
            The laye man the fayre,
            The Churchman in the quéere.
            Now baudye bable raygnes,
            The leachers none do slaye,
            Scarce Phinees with his sword
            (Alas) their méede could paye.
            In name, and courage great.
            Who shall Iudea ayde,
            With Statut lawes vniust
            So reuouse ouer laide?
            
               Will Moyses cumme, and tell
            Thegiptians lawes are naught?
            Amonst the people great
            Shall great his praise be wrought?
            Before kynge Pharao
            A God shall he vp stande
            To taunt this godles age,
            And Loosells of this lande?
            The godhead in his hart
            Who rightly doth conceyue?
            And doth not from the hole
            Some deale, or grace bereue?
            Who doth the furious wordes
            Of enmyes so refell,
            That in his hart, and mouthe
            Still loue, and wit doth dwell?
            Who in this publicke breche,
            For God this eger strife,
            Dothe kepe inbroken faith
            Mongst children of this lyfe?
            Who doth not like the waues
            Of Euripus the fludde,
            From this bancke vnto that
            From that to this reskudde.
            O godhead beare with me
            Whom they with weapons beate,
            And of their rampinge rage
            Delaye the risinge heate,
            
               Giue boate to these our broyles,
            Releue our ruthe with rest,
            Let all our sorrowes sleape,
            And blesse vs with the best.
         
         
            A praier against Iulianus.
            WHatseuer fooe externall threts
            I way it not a rushe,
            Thoughe it be blacke and bluddy to,
            I feare no outwarde pushe.
            That fleshborne beast in vgly synne
            That fearre our churche doth chase,
            The deuls triumphant lustly lymme,
            That plieth in eche place,
            That toppe, and tippe of mischeifes all,
            Can neuer make me quake.
            Nor all his blades bright brandishing
            Can pale my visage make.
            Thoughe sword: though fier, though bests,
            Do minace headlong fal,
            To drowne in deapes, thoughe he alone though he,
            In outrage vanquishe all
            Ould tyrannes fell, which beare them brag
            Of torments persant kéene,
            Deuisinge freshe and nouel plagus,
            To those which earst hath béene,
            Of this we haue to force the lesse:
            Our pacience may be more,
            
               A only meadson we do knowe
            And proper for this sore.
            One mery victory we haue,
            Which can not misse the game
            Our Christ who so shall dye for him
            Wil glorifie the same.
            But inward brech, and cyuill broyle
            Do make me to astarte,
            And quyt excludeth all my force,
            And vigor from my hart:
            My self know not my selfe in trothe,
            I wote not what to make.
            Ne wote I what confections good
            For soores vnknowen to take.
            No wyt, no reason, no good gift
            Of spirit nowe is left,
            No manner armoure gainst the deuill
            That thus inuads by theft,
            And wynnes by craft, and treachery.
            Who shall him now subdue,
            Shall Moyses preachynge on the mounte
            A broad his hands that threwe?
            Who leuing them vppon the rocke
            In shadowe figurde Christ,
            And proude the man of God in god
            Of naught to be agrist.
            So Almileke confounded was
            And all his couraige Layde
            
               Who alwayes gainst the sayntes of God
            An enemies part had plaide.
            Who shall this Moyses next succeade
            What Iosua? what he
            That of Iesus in name and deade
            A figure thought shalbe?
            He ioyninge host with god aboue
            Got ensignes great in warre,
            And throughe the name of Iesus he
            Was victour neare, and farre.
            With outwhose helpe we trust in vaine:
            Then Dauid he succeads,
            Or wright he verse, or cast with slinge
            An happy man he speads.
            Him god to battayle troubles fell
            In armoure did attyre,
            And exercisd his hooly handes
            In bloudy banquetts dyre.
            Some Samuell we wishe for next
            At nead to serue our turne,
            Upon the alter for the folke
            Freishe incence franke to burne.
            To knele, and pray vpon his knées,
            Gods maiestie to please,
            A kynge to noynte a conquerer
            Thungodly to disease.
            Who worthelie with bitter teares
            Our dolours can lament?
            
               Sad Ieremye wold stand in steade
            With sorrowes througly spent,
            Who writ for Iuishe folke his Threnes
            A lamentable verse,
            Who prayers for our pardon can
            With voyce on hie reherce.
            O spare vs God of heauen thrise blest,
            And graciouse marke our case,
            Spare vs that feare▪ spare vs thy flocke
            Replenishd with they grace.
            Our wicked proud disdaynfull fooe
            Let hym not se our shame,
            And let no stranger nation vs
            (Thy chosen people) tame.
            Who ells for vs alyue might praye
            Iob, Daniel, and Noe?
            In prayer one, in mynde all one
            These thre as one maye gooe.
            And pray that all this hooly strife
            At lenght might pause, and cease,
            That we our selfes, might know our selfs,
            And ioye our owne in peace:
            That one an other frindly knowe,
            And to an other speake,
            And that one lynked people we
            Our frindship do not breake.
            If Israell we haue bine one,
            And one in saith did bide,
            
               To Israel, and Iudas nowe
            Our selfs lets not deuide.
            
               Roboam and Ieroboam
            
            Mongst vs No more let be,
            Ierusalem and Samary
            No further let vs se,
            For he will visit vengfully
            Our detestable strife,
            We all accuse, but he discerns
            Which party syns in life.

            THe knittinge best of two in one
            Of all that we can find
            Is weadlocke, which ingendreth flockes
            And longe conserueth kinde.
            The death of some, and birth of some
            Upholdes makind in one,
            A ryuer stands by that that commes,
            And fades in that thats gonne.
            But after that all coastes of the yearth
            And bonds out streched wide
            Whence winds from East, weast, North, &amp; Sowth
            Procead with puffing pride
            The sonnes of men had ouer spred:
            Our fleshe beganne to frye,
            
               With heat of sin, then plangs cam one
            And men their skourge did trye.
            Toungs sundry were distributed,
            Then raynd downe firy showers,
            Then cam the tables, and their texts
            The Prophettes shryle out powres.
            But all this chast not synne awaye,
            It to the fleshe was tyde
            Idolatry, wyne, Lechery
            Their pampringe did abide.
            At lengh an other benyfit
            To them from hie was sent,
            From God the father, and the sonne
            Purposed by intent.
            For God which did mens bodyes vew
            And se their heauenly mynds,
            Orechargde with yearthly dreggs &amp; drosse,
            Corruptyng from their kindes,
            That man was seruant to the féende:
            To coule so ferce a fitt
            To other nowe the cuers therof,
            No more he wold comitt.
            Great soores, great salues. him selfe came downe,
            (His honour then forlorne)
            Of heauenly syer, an heauenly prynce
            Mongst men man was he borne.
            In sinne not man: (which some thinke not,

               Ye came flesh forth the virgins wombe
            Her chastitye not broke.
            Both God he came, and man he came,
            Both Natures ioynd in oue,
            This spied, that hid: a carnall man
            For mortal man alone.
            One God, one Christ, one man of God,
            (A straungy mixture new)

            That first vs ouer threwe.
            I onc receyud this heauenly soule:
            Christ toke both corps, and ghost
            First Adame had his wil to chose,
            Whilst Serpent can to bost
            The aplefruyte, for which (alas)

            For him that should haue better sene
            With pure, and ayrie light,
            And was for holy things a Préest
            Appointed in gods light.
            Him to redeme our God was glad
            In mortall body playne,
            The slaughter of the mansleer
            To rescue with his bane.

            Within this corps of woe.
            
               So diuerse is this daungrous life,
            So raging ruffles synne,

            Muche like the litle Ante,
            Who thoughe it doth with stande it stoute
            By force of greater strength.
            Is easy drawen, and dragd aboute.
            My soule comes from aboue
            Compact I was of earth and ayre,
            My corps comes from beneath,
            My ghost from gods mouth yssude fayre.
            With daungers great I stryue
            Which partly harme me through my fooes,
            And this rebelliouse fleshe
            Doth partly eke increase my wooes.
            O world I ende my dayes,
            Preserue my flocke from ieopardy,

            AS in the ayre the foules,

               Suche is the heauie hap
            That we are lapped in,
            I like it not to liue,
            As ill I like to dye,
            In both respects I quake.
            If thou demande me, why?
            My synnes are growen so great
            They ouerlode my heade
            And worse they would me plague
            Alas if I were deade.
            This life is suche a lumpe,
            So massye to sustayne,
            And when thou goost from hence,
            Thou goost to further payne.
            Of both sides feare is great,
            The beast that I can finde,
            Is Christ to fly to the

            Thy selfe to passe contende thou still

            But Hypocrites do rayne
            Those after god will cutt awaye

            If that she felt no care,
            Nor euer in hir fleshe felt fraye,
            An happie one was she,
            Begotten in a lucky daye.
            But if hir stormes were stearne,
            If many tymes, and soore she fought,
            Against hir will it was
            (I thinke) that me to world she brought.

               MY ende of life is come
            A shipman I the mayne hath past,
            For me doth now remayne▪
            
            Due for my sinnes a bitter blast.
            The vggly shade of hell,
            Fercefyers, &amp; darksome profound night,
            Now all my crymes must come
            And be detected bare in light.
            But in this latest acte
            Rue on me Christ, and stand me nye,
            And now my neadfull wante
            (O Sauiour deare) do thou supplye.
            I suffer in my soule,
            And troblouse feares do me agrize
            That anger thine on me
            Should fall in wrekful woofull wise.
            Fayne would I passe from paynes,
            That so my hart consume and eate
            And carry hence with me,
            My busy destnyes dreadfull great.
            But dying vnto you
            Which after me suruiue behinde
            I do protest with faith,
            And tell you truly as I finde,
            Beleue me (deare my frinds)
            There is no profit of this lyfe,
            The death ther of doth bring
            A lasting life deuoide of strife.
         
         
            
            A repulse to the deuill A passage to heauen A Farewell to the worlde
            DEpart thou from my breast
            A waye thou subtile deuil, and slye
            Depart thou from my lyfe,
            And from my body by and by,
            Thefe, Serpent, Bellyall, Fyer,
            Beast, gaper Dragon, death, and vice,
            Thou Frensy, darknesse, night
            That into guile dost all intyce.
            Inchaunter, full of spite,
            That dost in murder pleasure much,
            Our parents that vndost
            With sinne, and death and pestlence such.
            Go get the to the seas
            Christs so commaunds, or to the rockes
            As did the legion once,
            Take vp thy rome in swinishe flockes.
            Forlorne, be faringe hence,
            The death of Christ will ells the paye,
            That death in all my partes
            That death in all my hart doth staye,
            Christs death before my fete,
            The death of Christ is all my ioye,
            Thou crafty wilt thou not
            Surceasse to worke me mor annoye?
            Wilt thou not go aside?
            
               Wilt thou not fling the headlong downe
            On Sodome set thine eys
            That now for sinne dispeopled towne,
            To lewd blasphemouse flokes
            The Godhead great that proude dispise
            Begonne, and do not vexe
            My hoary head in tempting wise.
            With thy malignaunt thought
            Thou makst my mynde both blacke &amp; bloe,
            Wilt nether thou for me,
            Nor yet for God wilt thou hence gooe?
            Gods will doth the discharge
            No more thou canst be gonne thou pelfe,
            Thy lycence is exspirde,
            Thynke not to make me lyke thy selfe.
            Nowe must I marche to heauen,
            Up to the Threshoulds pure, and fine
            With fresh, and gloriouse lyght
            My nouell lyfe must shewe, and shine.
            To god aloft in skyes.

               He that his father doth deny
               Denieth not him alone,
               For by the father God did worke
               As causes ioynde in one.
            
            
               A good name a good possession.
               Mothes eate vp all: thy goodes with thee
               In tumbe shall not be cladde,
               At death thyne only honour is
               A good name to haue had.
            
            
               Spare straungers, and the dead.
               Spare straūgers much, but more thē spare
               Whiche hence are gone away,
               And left behinde them what they had,
               Them selfes inclosde in clay.
            
            
               An other life.
               In Gods name, leaue and quite forsake
               The worlde and worldly vayles,
               And vp to skyes with course direct
               And courage speade thy sayles.
            
            
               The Trinitie, the fountaine.
               The ishue of all honest actes
               From God must haue their course,
               
                  The thrise and most blest trinitie
               Of goodnesse well, and source.
            
         
         
            Mans life.
            This course of guilfull life
            Whiche flitteth forth of hande
            A toppe is litle suer,
            And litle like to stande,
            It rouleth vp side downe,
            It runnes without redresse,
            When moste it semes to staye
            It so muche stayes the lesse,
            We holde it but in flight,
            It fadeth when it bides,
            It skipping sone is paste,
            Yeat hard at last it slides,
            It drawes, and eke redrawes
            With it a stackring state,
            We may discriue it thus,
            Which realeth in this rate,
            This raging reastles life,
            So chaunging eury hower,
            A dreame, a smother light,
            Of grasse a fleting flower.
         
         
            A christian life.
            Eche Christian man becomes
            Teares, watching, toyll▪ and payne
            And rage of strong affectes
            
               In glouing hart do strayne,
            His belly to imbarre
            To Christe him to inthrall,
            To mynde the latter daie,
            And trembling quake withall.
            FINIS.
