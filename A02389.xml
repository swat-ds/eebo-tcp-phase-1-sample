            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

TO ALL THE NOBIlitie,

graunte wiſedome and all thinges nedefull
for the preſeruation of their
Eſtates. Amen.
            
               
                  PLato among many of his
notable ſentences concernyng the gouernement
of a common weale hath this: well is
that Realme gouerned, in which the ambicious,
deſire not to beare office. Whereby you
may perceiue (right honourable) what offices
are, where they be duely executed: not gainfull ſpoyles
for the gredy to hunt for, but painefull toyles for the heady to
bee charged with. You may perceiue alſo by this ſentence,
there is nothing more neceſſary in a common weale, then that
Magiſtrates be diligent and truſty in their charges.
            ¶And ſure in whatſoeuer Realme ſuch prouiſion is made, ye
officers be forced to do their duties: there is it as hard a matter
to get an officer, as it is in other places to repulſe &amp; ſhift of
thoſe that with flattery, brybes, and other ſhiftes, ſue &amp; preace
for offices. For the ambitious (that is to ſaye prollers for power
or gayne) ſeeke not for offices to helpe other, for whych
cauſe officers are ordained: but with the vndoing of other, to
enrich themſelues. And therfore 
                  •
               ar them once of this bayt, &amp;
force them to do their dueties, then will they geue more to be
rid from their charges, than they did at yt firſt to come by e
                  •
               ē:
For they ſeeke onely their priuate profite. And therfore, where

the ambitious ſeeke no office: there no doubt, offices are duely
miniſtred. And whe
                  •
               e offices are duely miniſtred, it cannot be
choſen, but the people are good, whereof muſt nedes follow a
good common weale. For if the magiſtrates be good, the people
cannot be ill. Thus the goodnes or badnes of any Realme
lieth in the goodnes or badnes of the Rulers. And therfore not
without great cauſe do the holy Appoſtles ſo earneſtly charg
vs to pray for the magiſtra
                  •
               es: For in dede the wealth &amp; quiet
of euery common weale, the diſorder alſo and miſeries of the
ſame, come ſpecially thorough them. I neede not go eyther to
the Romaines or Greekes for the profe hereof, neither yet to ye
Iewes, or other nations: whoſe common weales haue alway
floriſhed whyle their magiſtrates were good, and decayed and

                to ruyne, when vici
                  •
               us men had the gouernement.
            Out countrey ſtories (if we reade and marke them) wil ſhow
vs examples enow, would God we had not ſene mo thā enow.
I purpoſe not to ſtand herevpon the particulars, becauſe they
be in parte ſetforth in the tragedies folowing. Yet by ye waye
this I note (wiſhing all other to doe the like) namely, that as
good gouernours haue neuer lacked their deſerued praiſes: ſo
haue not the bad eſcaped infamy, beſides ſuch plagues as are
horrible to heare of. For God (ye ordeiner of offices) although
he ſuffer them for puniſhment of the people to be often occupied
of ſuch, as are rather ſpoilers and Iudaſſes, than toilers
or Iuſtices (whom the ſcriptures cal Hypocrits) yet ſuffereth
he them not to ſcape vnpuniſhed, becauſe they diſhonour him.
For it is Gods own office, yea his chief office which they beare
and abuſe. For as Iuſtice is the chief vertue, ſo is ye miniſtration
thereof, the chiefeſt office: and therfore hath God eſtabliſhed
it with the chiefeſt name, honouring and calling Kinges
and all officers vnder them by his owne name: Gods. Ye be al
Gods, as many as haue in your charge any miniſtration of iuſtice.
What a foule ſhame were it for any nowe to take vpon
them the name and office of God, and in their doings to ſhew

themſelues deuils? God cannot of Iuſtice, but plague ſuche
ſhameleſſe preſumption and hipocriſie, and that with ſhamful
death, diſeaſes, or infamye. Howe he hath plagued euil rulers
from time to time, in other nations, you may ſee gathred in

coūſayled by dyuers of them to

Bochas left, vnto this preſēt time, chiefly of ſuch

might bee as a Myrrour for men of all eſtates and

but becauſe it was a matter paſſing my wit &amp; ſkill,
and more thanckleſſe than gaynefull to enterpriſe. I
refuſed vtterly alone to vndertake it without the
helpe of ſutch, as in wit were apt, in learninge allowed,
and in iudgemente and eſtimation able to
wield and diſcharge the weight of ſutch a burden,
thinkinge ſo to ſhift my handes. But hee earneſt
and diligent in hys affayres, procure me an Athlas

to laye the burden vppon my ſhoulders, which I
would not haue undertaken, but that ſhortly after
diuers learned men (whoſe many giftes nede few
prayſes) conſented to take vpon them part of the
trauaile. And when certayne of them to the numof
ſeuen, were through a generall aſſent at an appoyncted
time and place, gathered together to deuiſe
thereuppon: I reſorted vnto them, bringinge
with mee the booke of Bochas tranſlated by Dan
Lidgate, for the better obſeruation of his order:
which although wee did not miſlyke, yet would it
not conueniently ſerue, ſeing that both Bochas, &amp;
Lidgate were dead, neither were there any alyue
that had medled wt like argumēt, to whom the vnfortunate
might make their moane. To make therfore
a ſtate meete for the matter, they al agreed that
I ſhoulde vſurpe Bochas rome, and the wretched
Princes complaine vnto me: and toke vpon themſelues,
euery man for his part to be ſundry perſonages,
and in their behalfes to bewaile vnto me their
ſundry chaunces, heauy deſtenies, and wofull miſfortunes.
This done, wee opened ſutch Bookes of
Chronicles as wee had there preſent, and Maiſter
Ferrers after hee had founde where Bochas left,
which was about the ende of Kinge Edward the
thirdes raigne, to begin the matter, ſayd thus.
            I maruayle (ꝙ hee) what Bochas meaneth to
forget among his myſerable Princes, ſuch as were
of our Nation, whoſe number is as great as theyr

Aduentures wonderfull. For to let paſſe all, both
Britaynes, Danes, and Saxons, and to come to the laſt
Conqueſt, what a ſort are they, and ſome alſo in the
time of Bochas himſelfe, or not much before. As for
example William Rufus the ſecond kinge of Englande
after the Cōqueſt, eyther by malice or miſaduenture
ſlayne hunting in the new foreſt, by Walter
Tirrell with ye ſhot of an arrow. Robert Duke
of Normandy eldeſt ſonne to William Conquerour
depriued of his inheritaunce of England, by Henry
his youngeſt brother hauing both his eyes put out,
and after, myſerably impriſoned in Cardiffe Caſtel,
whereas hee died. The moſt Lamentable caſe of
William, Rychard, and Mary, children of the ſayde
Henry the firſt called Beauclerke, drowned vpon y•
Sea by the negligence of drunken Mariners, and
Kynge Rychard the fyrſt ſlaine with a quarel in his
chiefe proſperity. The moſt vnnaturall murther of
Artur Duke of Britayne right Heyre of Englande,
by king Ihon his vncle, wt the death of Iſabell his
Siſter by Famyne. The myſerable ende of the ſayd
king Ihon their vncle by Surfet, or as ſome write
poyſoned by a Monke of the Abbey of Swinſted in
Lyncolneſhrye. Are not their Hiſtories ruful, and of
rare Example? But as it ſhould appeare, Bochas
being an Italian, minded moſt the Romayne, and Italike
Story, or els perhaps hee wanted the knowledge
of ours. It were therefore a goodly and notable

matter, to ſearch and diſcourſe our whole ſtory
from the firſt beginninge of the inhabiting of the
Iſle. But ſeeinge the Printers mynde is to haue vs
ſupply where Lidgate left, we wil
                  •
                leaue that great
labour to other yt may intende it, and (as one being
bold fyrſt to breake the Iſe) I will begin at y• reigne
of Rychard ye ſecōd, a time as troubleſome to ye people,
as vnlucky to y• Prince. And for aſmutch frende
Baldwin, as it ſhall be your charge to penne orderly
the whole proceſſe: I will ſo far as my memory,
and iudgement ſerueth, ſomewhat further you in
the truth of the ſtory. And therefore omittinge the
ruffle made by Iacke Straw &amp; his Lewd meiney,
with the murder of many notable mē which thereby
happened, (for Iacke as yee knowe was but a
poore Prince) I wil begin with a notable example,
which within a while after enſued. And although
the perſon (at whom I beginne) was no kinge nor
Prince: yet ſithens he had a Princely office, I wil
take vpon mee the miſerable perſon of Syr Robert
Treſilian chiefe Iuſtice of Englande, and of other
his fellowes learned in ye Law yt were plagued wt
him: thereby to warne all of theyr callinge &amp; profeſſion,
to be ware of wronge Iudgementes, miſcō
               ſtruinge
of Lawes, or wreſtinge the ſame to ſerue
the Prynces turne, which rightfully brought
them to a myſerable ende, which they
may iuſtly lament in maner
enſuinge.

Robert Treſilian chief Iuſtice of England,
and other his fellowes, for miſconſtruinge the Lawes
and expoundinge them to ſerue the Prynces
affections. Anno.
1388.
            
               
                  IN the rufull Regeſter of miſchifee, and miſhap,
               Baldwin we beſech thee with our names to begin,
               Whom vnfrendly Fortune did trayne vnto a trap,
               Whē we our ſtate eſtéem'd moſt ſtable to haue bin:
               So lightly léeſe they all, which all do weene to winne:
               Learne by vs yee Lawyers, and Iudges of the Lande,
               Vpright and vncorrupt in dome alway to ſtand.
            
            
               And print yee this preſident to remayne for euer,
               Enroll and recorde it in tables made of Braſſe,
               Engraue it in Marble that may bee razed neuer,
               Where Iudges of the Lawe may ſée as in a Glaſſe,
               What guerdon is for guile, and what our wages was,
               Who for filthy lucre, corrupt with meede and awe,
               Wittingly and wretchedly did wreſt the ſence of Lawe.
            
            
               A chaunge more new or ſtraunge, when was there euer ſéene,
               Then Iudges from the Bench to come downe to the Barre,
               And counſaylours that were, moſt nigh to King and Quéene
               Exiled their countrey, from Court and counſayle farre,
               But ſuch is Fortunes play that can both make and marre,
               Exaltinge to moſt highe, that was before moſt lowe,
               And turning tayle agayne, the lofty downe to throwe.
            
            
               
               And ſuch as late afore, could ſtoutly ſpeake and pleade
               Both in Court, and Countrey, careleſſe of the triall,
               Stand muet as Mammers without aduice, or reade
               All to ſeeke of ſhiftinge, by trauerſe or deniall
               Which haue ſeene the day, when for a golden Riall
               By fineſſe and cunning, could haue made blacke ſeeme whit
               And moſt extorted wronge, to haue appeared righte.
            
            
               Whilſt thus on bench aboue, wee had the higheſt place,
               Our reaſons were to ſtrong, for any to confute,
               But when at barre beneath, we came to pleade our caſe
               Our wittes were in the wane, our pleadinge very brute,
               Hard it is for Priſoners, with Iudges to diſpute
               When many againſt one, and none for one ſhall ſpeake.
               Who weenes himſelfe moſt wyſe, ſhall haply be to weake.
            
            
               To you therefore that ſit, theſe fewe wordes will I ſay,
               That no man ſits ſo ſure, but may be brought to ſtand,
               Wherefore whilſt you haue place, &amp; beare the ſwing, &amp; ſway
               By fauour without rygor, let poincts of Law bee ſkand:
               Pitty the poore Pryſoner that holdeth vp his hand,
               Ne lade him not with Law, who leaſt of Law hath knowne,
               Remember ere yee dye, the caſe may bee your owne.
            
            
               Beholde mee vnfortunate Foreman of thys Flocke,
               Treſilian, ſometime chiefe Iuſtice of this Lande.
               A Gentleman by byrth, no ſtayne was in my Stocke,
               Locketon, H
                     •
                  lt, and Belknay, with other of my bande,
               Which the Lawe and Iuſtice had wholly in our hande,
               Vnder the ſecond Rychard a Prince of great eſtates
               To whom and vs alſo, blinde Fortune gaue the mate.
            
            
               
               In the common Lawes oure ſkill was ſo profounde,
               Oure credit and aucthority ſuch, and ſo eſtéemed,
               That what that we concluded was taken for a grounde,
               Allowed was for Lawe, what ſo to vs beſt ſeemed.
               Lyfe, Death, Landes, goods, and all by vs was deemed.
               Whereby with eaſy payne, great gaine we did in fet,
               And euery thinge was fiſhe, that came vnto our net.
            
            
               At Seſſions and Siſes, we bare the ſtroke and ſway,
               In pantents and commiſſion, of Quorum alway chiefe:
               So that to whether ſide, ſoeuer we did way,
               Were it by right or wronge, it paſt without repreſe,
               The true man we let hang, ſomwhiles to ſaue a Thiefe,
               Of Golde and of Siluer, our handes were neuer empty,
               Offices, F
                     •
                  rmes, and Fees, fell to vs in great plenty.
            
            
               But what thinge may ſuffice vnto the greedy man?
               The more he hath in hold, the more he doth deſire,
               Happy and twyce happy is hee, that wiſely can
               Content himſelfe with that, which reaſon doth require,
               And moyleth for no more, then for his needefull hyre:
               But greedineſſe of minde doth ſeeldome keepe the ſyſe,
               To whom enough and more, at no time doth ſuffiſe.
            
            
               For like as Dropſy pacients drinke and ſtill be drye,
               Whoſe vnſtaunched Thirſt no Liquor can Alaye,
               And drincke they nere ſo mutch, yet Thirſt they by and by,
               So Catchers, and Snatchers toyle both night and day,
               Not néedy but gréedy, ſtill prollinge for their Praye,
               O endeleſſe Thirſt of Gold▪ corrupter of all Lawes,
               What miſchiefe is on mould whereof thou art not cauſe.
            
            
               
               Thou madeſt vs forget the fayth we did profeſſe,
               When Sergeants we were ſworne to ſerue the cōmon Law,
               Makyng a ſolempne oth in no paynt to dygreſſe.
               From approued Principles in ſentence nor in ſawe:
               But we vnhappy wyghts without al dread and awe,
               Of the Iudge eternall, more high to be promoted.
               To Mammon more then God, all wholly were deuoted.
            
            
               The Lawes we did interprete and ſtatutes of the Land,
               Not truely by the Text, but newly by a gloaſe:
               And wordes y• were moſt plaine, when they by vs were ſcand,
               Wee turned by conſtruction like a Welſhmans hoaſe,
               Whereby many a one both life and Land did looſe:
               Yet this we made our meane to mount a loft on Mules,
               And ſeruing times and turues, peruerted Lawes and rules.
            
            
               Thus clyming and contending alway to the toppe.
               From hie, vato higher, and than to be moſt hye,
               The honny dew of Fortune ſo faſt on vs did droppe,
               That of King Richards counſayle we came to be moſt nye:
               Whoſe fauoure to attayne, we were full fine and ſlye
               Alway to his auayle, where any ſenſe might ſound,
               That way (were it all wrong) 
                     •
                  he Lawes we did expound.
            
            
               So workinge Lawe like waxe, the ſubiect was not ſure
               Of Life, Land, nor goods, but at the Princes will,
               Which cauſed his kingdome the ſhorter time to dure,
               For clayminge power abſolute both to ſaue and ſpill,
               The Prince thereby preſumed his people for to pill:
               And ſet his luſtes for Lawe, and will had reaſons place,
               No more but hange and draw, there was no better grace.
            
            
               
               The King thus outleaping, the limits of his lawe,
               Not raygning but raginge, as wyll did him entice,
               Wyſe and worthy perſons from Court did daylye drawe,
               Sage counſell ſee at naught, proud vaunters were in price,
               And royſters bare the rule, which waſted al in vyce,
               Of ryot and exceſſe, grew ſcarcitie and lacke,
               Of 
                     •
                  acking came taxing, and ſo went wealth to wracke.
            
            
               The Barons of the Land, not bearing this abuſe,
               Conſpiring with the commons aſſembled by aſſent,
               And ſeing no reaſon nor trea
                     •
                  ye could induce
               The king in any thing his rigour to relent,
               Maugre his princely mynde: they cald a Parliament
               Francke and free for all men, vnchecked to debate
               Aſwell for weale publique, as for the Princes ſtate.
            
            
               In which high aſſemblye, great thinges were proponed.
               Touching the Princes ſtate, his regally and crowne,
               By reaſon that Richard, which much was to be moned,
               Without regard at all, of honour or renowne,
               Miſled by ill aduiſe, had turnde al vpſide downe:

               WHen finiſhed was this Tragedy, which ſemed
not vnfyt for the perſons touched in y•
ſame. Another which in the meane tyme
had ſtayde vppon ſyr Roger Mortimer Earle of
March, and heyre apparaunt of Englande, whoſe
miſerable end (as it ſhould appeare) was ſomwhat
before the others: ſayd as foloweth. Although it be
not greatlye appertinent to our purpoſed matter,
yet in my iudgement, I thincke it would do wel to
obſerue the tymes of theſe great infortunes, and as
they be more auncient in tyme, ſo to place their ſeuerall
plaintes: For I fynde that before theſe (of
whō maiſter Ferrers here hath ſpoken) there were
two earles of ye name of Mortimer, the one in the
tyme of king Edward the third out of our date: another
in Richard the ſecondes time, ſlayne in Ireland,
a yeare before the fal of theſe Iuſtices: whoſe
hyſtorie ſyth it is notable, and thexample fruitful, it
were not good to ouerpaſſe. And therfore by your
lycence and fauours, I wyl take vpon me the perſonage
of the earle Mortimer called Roger,
who full of bloudye woundes mangled,
with a pale countenaunce, and

                  rayle, theyr bliſſes brittle bee:
               For proofe whereof, although none other were,
               Suffice may I, Sir Roger Mortimer.
            
            
               Not he that was in Edwardes dayes the third,
               Whom Fortune brought from boote to extreme bale,
               With loue of whom, the Queene ſo much was ſtird,
               As for his ſake from honour ſhe did ſcale,
               And whileſt Fortune, blew on this pleaſaunt gale,
               Heauing him high on her triumphall Arch,
               By meane of her hee was made Earle of March.
            
            
               Whence pryde out ſprang, as doth appeare by manye,
               Whom ſoden hap, aduaunceth in exceſſe,

               Which in high wealth that humor can ſuppreſſe,
               As in this earle, playne proofe did wel expreſſe:
               For whereas hee too loftye was before,
               His new degree hath made him now much more.
            
            
               
               For now alone he ruleth as him luſt,
               Reſpecting none ſaue only the Queene mother,
               Which moued malice to foulder out the ruſt,
               Which deepe in hate, before did lye and ſmother.
               The Peeres, the People, aſwel the one as other.
               Againſt him made ſo haynous a complaint,
               That for a traytour, they did the Earle attaynt.
            
            
               Than al ſuch crimes as hidden lay before,
               They ſkower a freſh, and ſomwhat to them adde,
               For hydden hate hath eloquence in ſtore,
               Whan Fortune biddes ſmall faultes to make more bad,
               Fyue haynous crymes againſt him ſoone were had,
               Cauſing the king to yeld vnto the Scot,
               Townes that this father, but late afore had got.
            
            
               And therewithall the Charter called Ragman,
               Yeuen to the Scots for brybes and priuie gayne,

               And laſt of all by pyllage at his pleaſure,
               Had ſpoyld the kyng and commons of their treaſure.
            
            
               For theſe thinges lo, which erst were out of mynde,
               Dampned he was, and honged at the laſt,
               In whom dame Fortune fully ſhewed her kynde,
               For whome ſhe heaues, ſhe hurleth downe as faſt:
               It men to come, would learne by other paſt,

               Which was I wene my graund ſire or his brother:

               Eldeſt daughter and heire of Lyonell,
               Of King Edward the third the ſecond ſequele.
            
            
               My Father hight ſir Edmund Mortimer,
               Cald Earle of March, whence I was after Earle,
               By true diſcent theſe two my parentes were,
               Of whih the one of knighthood bare ferl
               Of Ladies all, the other was the pearle:
               After whoſe Death I onely ſtoode in plight,
               To be next heyre vnto the crowne by right.
            
            
               Touching the caſe of my couſin Roger,
               (Whoſe ruful end euen now I did relate)
               Was found in tyme an vndue atteindre

               That common grace to him denyed was.
            
            
               Wherfore by doome in Court of Parliament,
               His atteindre appering erroneous,

               Whyle Fortune thus did frendly me reteyne,
               Rychard the king, that ſecond was by name,
               Hauing none heire after him to reigne:
               Made me his mate in earneſt and in game:
               The Lordes themſelues ſo wel allowd the ſame,

               For whiles Fortune ſo luld me in her lap,
               And gaue me giftes more than I did require,
               The double Dame behynde me ſet a trap,
               To daſh me downe and laye all in the myre:
               The Iriſh Kernes agaynſt mee did conſpyre,
               My Landes of Vlſter vniuſtly to bereaue,
               Which my mother for heritage did me leaue.
            
            
               
               And whyles I there to ſet all thinges in ſtaye,
               (Omit my toyles and troubles thytherwarde)
               Among mine owne, with my retinue laye,

               And therfore the rechleſſe mannes reward:
               When leaſt I thought, ſet on me in ſuch number,
               That fro my corps, the lyfe they ſet aſunder.
            
            
               Nought might auayle my courage nor my force,
               Nor helpe of frendes. which were alas to few:
               The cruel folke aſſaulted ſo my horſe,
               That all my helpes in pieces they to hew,
               Our bloud diſtaind the ground as drops of dewe.
               Nought might preuayle to flye or yet to yelde,
               For whom they take they murther in che fielde.
            
            
               No law of Armes they know, nor none wil learne:
               They make not warre (as other do) a play,

               Yeeld or not yelde, whom ſo they take they ſlaye,
               They ſaue no priſoners, for raunſome, nor for paye:
               Their booty chiefe, they coumpt a deadmans heade
               Their end of warre's to ſee their enemie dead.
            
            
               Amongeſt theſe men, or rather ſauage beaſts
               I loſt my lyfe, by cruel murther ſlayne,

               That dread ſet apart my Prince I would mate.
            
            
               
               For whereas all kinges haue counſel of their choyſe,
               To whom they referre the rule of their Land,
               With certein familiers in whom to reioyce,
               For pleaſure or profite, as the caſe ſhall ſtand,
               I not hearing this, would needes take in hand,
               Maugre his will, thoſe perſons to diſgrace,

               But as an old Booke ſayth, who ſo wil aſſay,
               About the Cats necke to hang on any Bell,
               Had firſt neede to cut the Cats clawes awaye

               So putting on the Bel about the Cats necke,
               By being too buſie I caught a cruel checke.

               But in that ye be Lieges learne to obay,
               Submitting your willes to your Princes Lawes,
               It ſitteth not a ſubiect to haue his owne waye,

               For Princes like Lyons haue long and large pawes
               That reach at Randon, and whom they once twitch,
               They claw to the boane before the ſkinne itch.

               The commons in cluſters came to vs that day,
               To daunt Robert Veer, then Duke of Ireland,
               By whom King Richard was ruled alway,
               We put him to flight and brake his array,
               Then Maugre the king his leaue or aſſent,
               By Conſtables power we cald a Parliament.
            
            
               Where not in Roabes, but with Baſlardes bright,
               We came for to parle of the Publique weale,
               Confirming our quarel with maine and with might,

               To the order of thoſe, whom we did aſſigne.

               But glad 'to take me at ſuch aduauntage,

            HOVV THE LORDE
Mowbray promoted by Kynge
Rychard the ſeconde, to the State of a Duke,
was by him Baniſhed the Realme, in the
yeare of Chriſte. 1398. and after died
myſerably in exile.
            
               
                  THough ſorrowe and ſhame abaſh me to reherce,
               My lothſome lyfe and death of due deſerued,
               Yet that the paynes thereof may other pearce,
               To leaue the like, leaſt they be likewiſe ſerued,
               Ah Baldwin marke, aud ſee how that I ſwerued:
               Diſſemblinge, enuy, and Flattery, bane that bee
               Of al their Hoſts, haue ſhewed their power on mee.
            
            
               A blame not fortune though ſhe did her part,
               And true it is, ſhe can do little harme,
               She guideth goods, ſhe hampreth not the hart,
               A minde well 
                     •
                  ent, is ſafe from euery charme:
               Vice, onely vice, with her ſtout ſtrengthleſſe arme,
               Doth cauſe the heart from good to ill encline,
               Whych I alas, do finde to true by myne.
            
            
               For where by birth I came of noble race,
               The Mowbreys heyre, a famouſe houſe and olde,
               Fortune I thanke, gaue me ſo good a grace,
               That of my Prince I had what ſo I wolde:
               Yet neyther was, to other greatly holde,
               For I through flattery abuſd his wanton youth,
               And his fond truſt augmented my vntruth.
            
            
               
               Hee made mee firſt the Earle of Notingham,
               And Marſhall of England, in which eſtate
               The Pieres and people ioyntly to mee came,
               With ſore complaint, againſt them that of late
               Made officers, had brought the kinge in hate,
               By makinge ſale of Iuſtice, right, and Lawe,
               And liuinge naught: without all dreade or awe.
            
            
               I gaue them ayde theſe euils to redreſſe,
               And went to London with an army ſtrong,
               And cauſed the king, againſt his will oppreſſe
               By cruell death, all ſuch as led him wrong:
               The Lord chiefe Iuſtice ſuffered theſe among,
               So did the Steward of his houſhold head,
               The Chauncellor ſcapt, for he aforehand fled.
            
            
               Theſe wicked men thus from the king remoued,
               Who beſt vs pleaſed ſucceeded in their place:
               For which both Kinge, and Commons mutch vs loued,
               But chiefly I with all ſtoode high in grace,
               The Kinge enſued my rede in euery caſe,
               Whence ſelfe loue bred: for glory maketh proude,
               And pryde ay looketh alone to bee allowde.
            
            
               Wherefore to th'ende I might alone enioy
               The Kinges fauour, I made his luſt my lawe:
               And where of late I laboured to deſtroy,
               Sutch flatteringe folke, as thereto ſtode in awe,
               Now learned I amonge the reſt to clawe:
               For pride is ſutch, if it be kindly caught,
               As ſtroyeth good, and ſtirreth vp euery naught.
            
            
               
               Pryde prouoketh to flatter for the pray,
               To poll, and oppreſſe for maintenaunce of the ſame,
               To malice ſuch as match vnethes it may:
               And to be briefe, pride doth the hart enflame,
               To fyre what miſchiefe any fraud may frame,
               And euer at length the euils by it wrought
               Confound the worker and bring him vnto nought.
            
            
               Behold in me due proofe of euery part,
               For pryde prickt me firſt my prince to flatter
               So much, that who ſo euer pleaſed his hart,
               Were it neuer ſo euil, I thought it a lawfll matter,
               Which cauſed the Lordes afreſh againſt him clatter:
               Becauſe of Holdes beyond the ſea that 
                     •
                  e ſolde.
               And ſeene his ſouldiers of their wages polde.
            
            
               Though all theſe ills were done by myne aſſent,
               Yet ſuch was lucke that ech man deemed no:
               For ſee the Duke of Gloceſtre for me ſent,
               With other Lordes whoſe hartes did bleede for woe,
               To ſee the Realme ſo faſt to ruine goe:
               In fault whereof, they ſayd the two Dukes were,
               The one of Yorke, the other of Lancaſter.
            
            
               On whoſe remoue from place about the king
               We all agreed, and ſware a ſolem
                     •
                  ne oth,
               And whilſt the reſt prouided for this thing,
               I flatterer I, to wyn the prayſe of troth:
               Wretch that I was brake fayth and promiſe both:
               For I bewrayed the King, their whole intent,
               For which vnwares they all were tane and ſhent.
            
            
               
               Thus was the warder of the Common weale,
               The Duke of Gloceſter giltleſſe made away,
               With other moe, more wretch I ſo to deale,
               Who through vntruth their truſt did ill betraye:
               Yet by this meanes obteyned I my praye,
               Of king and Dukes I found for this ſuch fauour,
               As made me Duke of Northfolke for my labour.
            
            
               But ſee how pryde and enuye ioyntly runne,
               Becauſe my Prince did more then me preferre,

               Of Iohn of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaſter,

               Enuied this Duke, for nought ſaue that the ſhyne
               Of his deſertes, did gliſter more then mine.
            
            
               To thend therfore his light ſhould be the leſſe,
               I ſlylye ſought al ſhiftes to put it out,
               But as the poyze that would the palmetree preſſe,
               Doth cauſe the bowes ſprede larger round about,
               So ſpite and enuye cauſeth glory ſproute,
               And aye the more the toppe is ouer trode,
               The deeper doth the ſound roote ſpreade abrode.
            
            
               For when this Henrye Duke of Hereford ſawe,
               What ſpoy
                     •
                  e the King made of the noble blood,
               And that without al Iuſtice, cauſe, or lawe:
               To ſuffer him ſo, be thought not ſure nor good,
               Wherefore to me twofaced in one hood,
               As touching this he fully brake his mynde
               As to his frend that ſhould remedye fynde.
            
            
               
               But I, although I knewe my Prince did ill,
               So that my heart abhorred ſore the ſame,
               Yet miſchiefe ſo through malice led my will,
               To bringe this Duke from honour vnto ſhame,
               And toward my ſelfe, my Soueraygne to enflame:
               That I bewraye
                     •
                   his Words vnto the King,
               Not as a reade, but as a moſt haynous thing.
            
            
               Thus where my duty bounde me to haue tolde
               My Prince his fault, and wild him to refrayne,
               Through flattery loe, I did his ill vpholde,
               VVhich turnd at length both him and mee to payne:
               VVo, wo to Kinges whoſe counſaylours do fayne,
               VVo, wo to Realmes where ſutch are put in truſt,
               As leaue the lawe, to ſerue the Princes luſt.
            
            
               And wo to him that by his flatteringe rede,
               Maynteyns a Prince in any kinde of vice:
               VVo worth him eke for enuy, pryde or mede,
               That miſreportes any honeſt enterpriſe,
               Becauſe I beaſt, in all theſe poynctes was nice,
               The plagues of all together on me light,
               And due for ill: All doers doth acquite.
            
            
               For when the Duke was charged with my plaint,
               Hee flat denied that any part was true,
               And claymde by Armes, to aunſwere his attaint,
               And I by vſe, that Warly feates well knewe,
               To his deſire incontinently drewe:
               VVherewith the Kinge did ſeeme right well content,
               As one that paſt not mutch with whom it went.
            
            
               
               At time and place appoyncted wee appeard,
               At all poynctes Armed to proue our Quarelles Iuſt,
               And whan our Freendes on ech part had vs cheard,
               And that the Harolds had vs do our luſt:
               With ſpeare in reſt we toke a courſe to iuſt.
               But ere our horſes had runne halfe theyr way,
               A ſhoute was made the K

               And for to auoyde the ſheddinge of our bloud,
               VVith ſhame, and death which one muſt needes haue had,
               The Kinge through counſayle of the Lordes thought good
               To baniſhe both, wich iudgement ſtrait was rad:
               No maruayle than though both were wroth and ſad
               But chiefly I, that was Exild for aye,
               My Enmy ſtraungd but for ten yeares daye.
            
            
               The date expird, whan by this doubtfull dome,
               I ſhould depart to liue in baniſht hand,
               On payne of death to England not to come,
               I went my way: the Kinge ſea
                     •
                  d in his hand
               Myne Offices, my Honours, Good, and Land,
               To paye the due as openly hee tould,
               Of mighty ſummes, which I had from him pold.
            
            
               See Baldwin ſee, the ſalary of ſinne,
               Marke with what meede, vile vices are regarded
               Through Pride, and Enuy looſe both kith, and kinne,
               And for my flatteringe plaint ſo well rewarded,
               Exile, and ſlaunder are iuſt to mee awarded:
               My Wyfe, and Heire lacke Laudes, and lawfull Right,
               And mee theyr Lord made Dame Dianais Knight.
            
            
               
               If theſe miſhaps at home bee not enough,
               Adioyne to them my Sorrowes in Exile:
               I went to Almayne firſt, a Land right rough,
               In which I founde ſutch churliſhe Folke, and vile,
               As made mee lothe my life ech otherwhile:
               There lo, I learnd what it is to bee a geſt
               A broade, and what to liue at home in reſt.
            
            
               For they eſteeme no one man more than ech,
               They vſe as well the Lackey as the Lorde,
               And like their maners churliſhe in their ſpech,
               Their lodging hard, theyr bourd to bee abhord,
               Their pleityd Garments herewith well accord,
               All Iagde, and Frounſt, with diuers coulours deckt,
               They ſweare, they curſe, and drincke till they be flekt.
            
            
               They hate all ſuch, as theſe their maners hate,
               VVhich reaſon would, no Wiſeman ſhould allowe,
               VVith theſe I dwelt, lamentinge myne eſtate,
               Till at the length they had got knowledge, howe
               I was exilde, becauſe I did auowe
               A falſe complaint, agaynſt my truſty freende,
               VVhich made them thinke, mee worſe then any feende.
            
            
               That what for ſhame, and what for other griefe,
               I parted thence, and went to Venice towne,
               VVhereas I found, more pleaſure and reliefe,
               VVhich was not longe: for now the great renowne,
               Of Bolenbroke whom I, would haue put downe,
               VVas waxt ſo great in Britayne, and in Fraunce,
               That Venice through, ech man did him Auaunce.
            
            
               
               Loo! thus his Glory grewe great, by my diſpite,
               And I thereby increaſed in defame:
               So enuy euer, her hatred doth acquite
               VVith Trouble, Anguiſhe, Sorrowe, and ſelfe Shame,
               VVhereby her Foes do ſhine in higher Fame:
               Lyke Water waues, which clenſe the Muddy ſtone,
               And ſoyle themſelues by beatinge thereupon.
            
            
               Or eare I had ſoiourned there a yeare,

               Empriſoned him with other of his Fone,
               And made him yeelde him vp his Crowne, and Throne:
               VVhen I theſe thinges for true by ſearch had tryed,
               Griefe griped me ſo, I pined a way and died.
            
            
               Note here the ende of pryde, ſee Flatteries fyne,
               Marke the rewarde of enuy, and falſe complaynt,
               And warne all people from them to decline,
               Leaſt likely fault do finde the like attaynte.
               Let this my lyfe, to them be a reſtraynt,
               By others harmes who liſteth take no hede:
               Shall by his owne, learne other better rede.

            THis tragical example was of al the company
wel liked, howbeit a doubt was foūd therin,
&amp; that by means of the diuerſity of ye Chronicles

for whereas Hall (whoſe Chronicle in this
woorke was chiefelye folowed) maketh Mowbr
                  •
               y
appellant, and Bolenbroke defendant. Fabian
reporteth the matter quite contrarye, and that by
recorde of the Parliament rolle, wherein it is plain
that Bolenbroke was appellant &amp; Morobrey defendant
wherfore whatſoeuer ſhalbe ſayde in the
perſō of Mowbrey (who being a moſt noble prince
had to much wrong to be ſo cauſeles defamed after
his death) imagine the ſame to be ſpoken agaynſte
his accuſer. Which matter ſyth it is more harde to
decide, than nedefull to our yurpoſe, which mynde
only to diſſwade frō vices &amp; exalt vertue, we refer
to ſuch as may come by the Recordes of the Parliament,
contented in the meane while with Mayſter
Halles iudgement, which maketh beſt for our
foreſhewed purpoſe.
            This doubt thus let paſſe. I would ſayd M, Ferrers,
ſaye ſomwhat for K. Rich. the 2. after whoſe
depriuing, his brother &amp; diuers other made a maſke
mynding by K. Henries deſtructiō to haue reſtored
him, which maſkers matter ſo runneth in this yt I
doubt which ought to goe before, but ſeeing no mā
is ready to ſay ought in their behalfe, I wyll geue
(who ſo liſteth) leaſure to think thereon, &amp; in ye meane
time to further your enrerpriſe. I will in K. Richards
behalfe recount ſuch part of his ſtorye, as I
thinke moſt neceſſary. And therfore imagin Baldwin
y• you ſee y• corps of this Prince al to be māgled, wt
bloudy woundes, lyinge pale and wanne, naked

vpon a Beere in Paules Church, the People ſtanding
round about him, and making his complaint
in maner as foloweth.
         
         
            HOWE KINGE RICHARDE
the ſecond was for his euil gouernaunce
depoſed from his ſeate, in the yeare
1399. &amp; miſerably murthered in priſon
the yeare folowing.
            
               
                  HApyye is the Prince, that hath in wealth the grace
               Vertue to folow and vyces to keepe vnder,
               But woe to him whoſe wyl hath wiſdomes place:
               For who ſo renteth right and law aſunder,
               On him at length all the world ſhall wonder,
               Boaſt of high byrth, ſword, ſcepter, ne mace.
               Can warrant King or Keyſer fro the caſe,
               Shame ſueth ſinne, as rayne do drops of thunder,
               Let kinges therfore the Lawes of God embrace,
               That vayne delightes cauſe them not to blunder
            
            
               Beholde my hap, ſee how the ſeely route
               On me do gaze, and ech to other ſay:
               See where he lyeth, but late that was ſo ſtoute,
               Loe how the power, the Pride, and rich aray,
               Of mighty Princes lightly fade away.
               The King which earſt kept all the realme in doubt,
               Dead and leaſt dread, to graue is caryed out,
               What would be Kinges made of but earth and clay:
               Behold the woundes his body all about,
               Whe liuing here, thought neuer to decay.
            
            
               
               Mee thinke I heare the people thus deuiſe
               Wherefore Baldwin, ſith thou wilt now declare
               How Princes fell, to make the liuinge wiſe,
               My lawleſſe life, in no poynct ſee thou ſpare,
               But paint it out, that rulers may beware,
               Good counſayle, Lawe, or vertue to diſpiſe:
               For Realmes haue rulers, and rulers haue a ſiſe,
               Which if they breake, thus mutch to ſay I dare,
               That eythers griefes, the other ſhall agriſe
               Till one be loſt, the other brought to care.
            
            
               I was a Kinge, who ruled all by Luſt
               Without reſpect of Iuſtice, Right, or Lawe,
               In falſe Flatterers repoſinge all my truſt,
               Embracinge ſutch as could my vices clawe:
               Fro counſell ſage I did alwayes withdrawe,
               As pleaſure prickt, ſo nedes obay I muſt:
               Hauinge delite to feede and ſerue the guſt,
               Of God or man I ſtood no wiſe awe,
               Mee liked leaſt to Torney or to Iuſt.
               To Venus games my Fanſy did more drawe.
            
            
               Which to mayntayne, I gathered heapes of golde
               By Fines, Fiftenes, and loanes by way of preſt,
               Blanke Charters, Othes, and ſhiftes not knowen of olde,
               For which the people, my doinges did deteſt.
               I alſo ſould the noble towne of Breſt,
               My fault wherein, becauſe mine vncle tolde,
               (For Princes actes, may no wiſe he controld)
               His lyfe I tooke, vntried without Queſt,
               And all ſutch Lordes as did his cauſe vphold,
               Wyth long exile, or cruell death oppreſt.
            
            
               
               None ayde I lackt, in any wicked deede,
               For gayinge Gulles, whom I promoted had.
               Would further all in hoope of higher 
                     •

               There can no Kinge, ymagin ought ſo bad,
               But ſhall fynde ſome, to do the ſame moſt glad:
               For ſickneſſe ſeldome doth ſo ſwiftly breede,
               As humours ill, do growe the griefe to feede.
               Thus Kinges eſtatas, bee worſt of all beſtad.

               My lyfe and death the truth of this hath tryed:
               For whyle I ſought in Ireland with my foes,
               Myne vncle Edward, whom I left to guide
               My Realme at home, rebelliouſly aroſe,
               Traytors to helpe, which plied my depoſe:
               And cald fro Fraunce, Earle Bolenkroke whom I
               Exiled had, for ten yeares there to lye:
               VVho tyrantlike did execute all thoſe,
               That in mine ayde durſt looke but once awry,
               Of which ſort ſooneafter ſome their liues did loſe.
            
            
               For comming backe this ſoden ſtur to ſtaye,
               My Steward falſe to whom I truſted moſt:
               (VVhiles I in Wales at Flint my caſtle, laye,
               Both to refreſh and multiply myne Oſte)
               There in any Hall, mindinge to fly the Coaſt,
               His Staffe did breake, which was my houſehold ſtay
               Bad ech make ſhift and rode himſelfe away.
               See Princes, ſee, the ſtrength whereof wee boaſt,

               No better ſtay, then in a rotten Poſt.
            
            
               
               My Steward falſe, thus being fled and gone,
               My ſeruantes ſlye ſhrancke of on euery ſyde,
               Then caught I was, end led vnto my ſoen,
               Who for their Prince no Pallaice did prouide,
               But priſon ſtrong, where Henry puft with pryde,
               Cauſde we reſigne, abandonig my throane,

               WHen Maiſter Ferrers had ended this ſo
woful a Tragedye, and to all Princes a
right worthy inſtruction: hauing paſſed
through a miſeable time full of piteous
Tragedies, we pauſed a while. And ſeeing ye reign
of Henry the fowerth enſued, a Prince more ware
and Proſperous in his doinges, although not vntroubled
with warres, both of outfoorth and inward
enemies: we began to ſearch what Peer
                  •
               s
were fallen therein, where of the nomber was not
ſmall. And yet becauſe their examples were not
much to be noted for our purpoſe, we paſſed ouer
all the Maſke
                  •
               s of whom king Richardes brother
was chiefe: which were al ſlaine and put to Death
for their trayterous attempt. And fynding Owen

Glendour, a great Prince in Wales, next in ſucceſion
of ill Fortune with the ſtout Percies his confederates,
I thought it not meete to ouerpaſſe, ſo
great perſons with ſilence, and therefore ſayd thus
to the ſylent company: What my maiſters is euery
man at once in a browne ſtudy? hath no mā affectiō
to any of theſe ſtories? you minde ſo much ſome
other belike, that theſe do not moue you: and to ſay
the truth, there is no ſpecial cauſe why they ſhould.
Howe be it Owen Glendour, becauſe he was one
of Fortunes owne darlingrs, and affected to bee
Monark of Wales, although to his owne miſchiefe
and deſtruction, rather then he ſhould be forgottē,
I wil pray Maiſter Phaer who of late hath placed
hymſelfe in that country, &amp; haply hath met with his
ghoſt in the foreſt of Kylgarran that he wil ſay ſomwhat
in his perſon: which Owen comming out of
the wylde Mountaines of Wales like the image of
Death in al pointes (his harte onely excepted) as a
ghoſt forpined with extreame famine, cold and hunger,
may lamente his great miſfortune in
ſutch maner as you maiſter Phaer
are able moſt aptly to vtter and
ſet forth.

Mountaynes, where he moſt miſerably
ſtarued for hunger. Anno.

                  I Pray thee Baldwin ſith thou doſt entend,
               To ſhewe the fall of ſutch as climbe to hye,
               Remember mee, whoſe miſerable ende
               May teach all men Ambition to flye,
               Oh falſe Fortune, Fortune vengeaunce on
thee I crye:
               VVhich offeringe a Sop of ſweete receyt,
               Haſte made me byte the Hooke in ſteede of Bayt.
            
            
               A Brytton borne, and of the Tropan bloud,
               But ill brought vp, whereby full well I finde,
               That neyther byrth nor Linage make vs good:
               Though it be true that Cat will after kinde,
               Fleſhe gendreth fleſhe, but not the Soule or Minde,
               They gender not, but fouly do degender,
               When men to vice, from vertue they ſurrender.
            
            
               Eche thinge by nature, tendeth to the ſame
               Whereof it came, and is diſpoſed like:
               Downe ſincks the mould, vp mountes the fiery flame,
               With Horne the Hart, with Hoofe the Horſe doth ſtrike,
               The Wolfe doth ſpoyle, the ſuttle Foxe doth pike,
               And to conclude, no fiſhe, fleſhe, foule, or plant
               Of their true dame, the property doth want.
            
            
               
               But as for men, ſyth ſeuerally they haue
               A minde whoſe maners are by learninge made,
               Good bringinge vp, al onely doth them ſaue,
               In honeſt actes, which with their Parentes fade,
               So that true gentry ſtandeth in the trade
               Of vertues life, not in the fleſhly lyne:
               For bloud is brute, but Gentry is deuine.
            
            
               Experience, doth cauſe me thus to ſay,
               And that the rather for my countrey men,
               Which vaunt &amp; boaſt themſelues aboue the day,
               If they may ſtraine their ſtocke fro worthy men:
               VVhich let be true, are they the better then?
               Nay farre the worſe, if ſo they bee not good,
               For why they ſtayne the beuty of ther blood.
            
            
               How would we mocke the burden bearinge Mule,
               If hee would brag he were an horſes Sunne,
               To preſſe his pride (might nothing els him rule)
               His boaſtes to proue, no more but did him run:
               The horſe for ſwiftnes hath his glory wonne,
               The Mule coulde neuer the more aſpyer,
               Though hee ſhould proue that Pegas was his Sier.
            
            
               Ech man crake of that which was his owne,
               Our Parentes vertues are theirs, and no w
                     •
                  it ours,
               Who therefore wil of noble byrth be knowen,
               Ought ſhine in vertue like his Aunceſtours,
               Gentry conſiſteth not in Landes, and Towers:
               Hee is a churle though all the World were his,
               Yea Arthurs heyre, if that hee lyue amiſſe.
            
            
               
               For vertuous lyfe a Gentleman doth make,
               Of her poſſeſſour all be he poore as Iob,
               Yea thoughe no name of elders he can take:
               For proofe take Merlin fathered by an Hob.
               But who ſo ſets his minde to ſpoyle and rob,
               Although he come by due diſcent from Brute,
               He is a chorle, vngentle, vile, and brute,
            
            
               Well, thus did I for want of better witte,
               Becauſe my parents naughtely brought me vp:
               For Gentlemen (they ſayd) was nought ſo fitte,
               As to attaſt by bould attemptes the cup,
               Of conqueſtes wyne, wherof I thought to ſup:
               And therefore bent my ſelfe to rob and ryue,
               And whome I could of Laudes, and goods depriue.
            
            
               For Henry the fourth did then vſurpe the Crowne,
               Deſpoyled the Kinge, with Mortimer the heyre:
               For which his ſubiectes ſought to put him d
                     •
                  wne,
               And I while Fortune offered mee ſo fayre,
               Did what I might, his honour to appayre:
               And tooke on mee to bee the Prince of Wales,
               Entiſte thereto by prophecies, and tales.
            
            
               For which, ſutch Idle, as wayte vpon the ſpoyle,
               From euery part of VVales vnto mee drew,
               For loytering youth vntaught in any toyle,
               Are ready aye all miſchiefe to enſue:
               Through helpe of theſe ſo great my glory grewe,
               That I defyed my Kynge through lofty harte,
               And made ſharpe VVarre on all that tooke his parte,
            
            
               
               See lacke, I took Lord Raynold Gray of Rythen,
               And him enforſt my Daughter to eſpouſe,
               And ſo vnraunſomed I held him ſtill, and ſythen,
               In Wigmore lande through battayle rigorous,
               I caught the right heire of the crowned houſe:

               Than all the Marches longinge onto Wales,
               By Seuerne Weſt I did inuade and burne:
               Deſtroyed the Townes, in Mountaynes, and in Vales,

               Twelue thouſand moe in Milford did ariue,

               And pitched his field, on a hill hard by the ſame.

               By Henries rule, wherefore wee did agree

               The North part theirs, Wales wholly to bee mine,

               ytton,
then ſodenly one found a doubt worth the mouinge
and yt cōcerning this title, Thearle of March:
for as it appereth, there were three men of three diuers
nations together in one time entituled by that
honour: firſt ſir Edmund Mortimer, whom Owē
kept in Priſon, an Engliſhman: the ſecond y• Lord
George of Dunbar a valiaunt Scot, baniſhed out
of his countrey, &amp; well eſteemed of Henry the .iiij:
the third Lord Iames of Bourbon a Frenchman,
ſent by the French king to helpe Owen Glendour.
Theſe three men had this title all at once, which
cauſed him to aſke how it was true that euery one
of theſe coulde be Earle of Marche: whereto was
aunſwered, that euery countrey hath Marches belonging
vnto them, &amp; thoſe ſo large, that they were
Earldomes, &amp; the Lords thereof intituled thereby:
ſo ye lord Edmūd Mortimer was Earle of Marche
in England, lorde Iames of Burbō of y• Marches
of Fraunce, and Lord George of Dunbar Earle of
the Marches in Scotland. For otherwiſe neyther
could haue intereſt in others title. This dout thus
diſſolued, maiſter Ferrers ſayd: if no mā haue affection
to the Percies, let vs paſſe the times both of
Henry the fourth, and the fift, and come to Henry ye
               
ſixt, in whoſe time Fortune (as ſhe doth in the mynority
of Princes) bare a great ſtroke among ye nobles.
And yet in Henry the fourths time are examples
which I would wiſh Baldwin yt you ſhoulde
not forget, as the conſpiracy made by the Byſhop
of Yorcke, and the Lord Mowbray, ſonne of him
whom you late treated of: pricked forward by the
Earle of Northumberland, father to ſir Henry Hotſpur,
who fled himſelfe, but his partners were apprehended
&amp; put to death, with Baynton and Blinkinſops,
which could not ſe their duty to their king
but tooke parte wyth Percy that baniſhed Rebell.
As he was proceedinge, hee was deſired to ſtay by
one which had pondered the ſtory of the Percies,
who briefly ſayde. To the ende Baldwin that you
may knowe what to ſaye of the Percies, whoſe
ſtory is not all out of memory (and it is an notable
ſtory) I wyll take vpon me the perſon of the Lord
Henry Percy Earle of Northumberland, father
of Syr Henry Hotſpur, in whoſe behalfe
this may be ſayde as
followeth.

Percy Earle of Northumberlande,
was for his couetous, and trayterous attempt put
to death at Yorke.
Anno. 1407.
            
               
                  O Moral Senec, true finde I thy ſayinge,
               That neither kin, riches, ſtrength or fauour
               Ace free from Fortune, but are aye decayinge:
               No worldly wealth is ought ſaue doubtful labour
               Mans life in Earth is like vnto a Tabour.
               Which now to myrth doth mildly men prouoke
               And ſtraight to Warre with a more ſturdy ſtroke.
            
            
               All this full true I Percy finde by proofe,
               Which whilom was Earle of Northumberland:
               And therefore Baldwin for my Piers behoofe,
               To note mens falles ſith thou haſt tane in hande,
               I would thou ſhould my ſtate well vnderſtand:
               For fewe Kinges were more than I redoubted,
               Whom double Fortune lifted vp and louted
            
            
               As for my kinne their nobleneſſe is knowen,
               My valiaunt actes were folly for to prayſe,
               Where through ye Scots ſo oft were ouerthrowen.
               That who but I was doubted in my dayes:
               And that king Richard found at all aſſayes,
               For neuer Scots rebelled in his raygne,
               But through my force were eyther caught or ſlaine.
            
            
               
               A Brother I had was Earle of Worceſter,
               Alwayes in Office, and Fauour with the King:

               And though I ſay it, hee did deſerue the ſame.

                   Fortune ought both him and vs a ſpite:
               But chiefely mee, whom clearely from any crime,

                  terous Knight:
               VVhere through falſe ſlaunder forced mee to bee,
               That which before, I did moſt deadly flee.
            
            
               Let men beware how they true folke defame,
               Or threaten on them the blame of vices nought,
               For Infamy breedeth wrath, wreke followeth ſhame:
               Eke open ſlaunder oftentimes hath brought
               That to effect, that erſt was neuer thought,
               To bee miſdeemed, men ſuffer in a ſort:
               But noue can beare the griefe of miſreporte.
            
            
               Becauſe my Kinge did ſhame mee wrongfully
               I hated him, and ſo became his foe:
               And while hee did at Warre in Ireland lye,
               I did conſpire to turne his Weaie to woe:
               And through the Duke of Yorcke and other moe,
               All Royall power from him wee quickly toke,
               And gaue the ſame to Henry Bolenbroke.
            
            
               
               Neither did wee this onely for this cauſe,
               But to ſay truth, force draue vs to the ſame:
               For hee deſpiſinge God and all his lawes,
               Slewe whom hee woulde, made ſinne a very game,
               And ſeeinge neyther age nor counſayle could him tame,
               VVee thought it well done for the Kingdomes ſake,
               To leaue his rule, that did all rule forſake.
            
            
               But when ſir Henry had attaynd his place,
               Hee ſtraight became in all poynctes worſe than hee,
               Deſtroyed the Piers and ſlewe Kinge Richardes grace,
               Againſt his othe made to the Lordes and mee:
               And ſeeking Quarels howe to diſagree,
               Hee ſhameleſly required mee and my Sonne,
               To yelde him Scots, which wee in Fielde had wonne.
            
            
               My Nephew alſo Edmonde Mortimer
               The very heyre apparaunt to the Crowne,
               VVhom Owen Glendour helde as priſoner,
               Vilely bound in Dungeon deepe caſt downe,
               Hee would not Raunſome but did ſelly frowne,
               Againſt my Brother and mee which for him ſpake,
               And him Proclaymed Traytour for our ſake,
            
            
               This foule deſpite did cauſe vs to conſpire,
               To put him downe as wee did Richard erſt,
               And that wee might this matter ſet on fire,
               From Owens Iayle, our Cooſin wee remeerſt,
               And vnto Glendour all our griefes reherſt:
               VVho made a bond with Mortimer, and mee,
               To priue the Kinge, and part the Realme in three.
            
            
               
               But when king Henry heard of this deuiſe,
               Toward Owen Glendour he ſped him very quicke,
               My 
                     •
                  ding by force to ſtop hur enterpryſe:
               And as the deuil would, than fel I ſicke,
               Howbeit my brother and ſonne more pollitike
               Than proſperous, with an hoſt from Scotland brought,
               Encountred him at Shreweſbury where they fought.
            
            
               The one was tane and 
                     •
                  yld, the other ſlaine.
               And ſhortly after was Owen put to flight:
               By meanes whereof, I forced was to fayne,
               That I knew nothing of the former fight.
               Fraud oft auayles more than doth ſturdy might:
               For by my fayning I brought him in belife,
               I knew not that wherein my part was chiefe.
            
            
               And while the kyng thus toke me for his frend,
               I ſought all meanes my former wrong to wreake,
               Which that I might bring to the ſoner end,
               To the biſhop of Yorke I did the matter breake,
               And to th'earle Marſhall likewiſe did I ſpeake.
               Whoſe father was through Henryes cauſe exiled,
               The biſhops brother with trayterous death defiled.
            
            
               Theſe ſtrayt aſſented to do what they could,
               So did the Lord Haſtings and Lord Faucōbridge:
               Which altogether promiſed they would,
               Set all their power, the kinges dayes to abridge,
               But ſee the ſpite, before the byrdes were flydge
               The Kinge had word and ſeaſoned on the neſt,
               Whereby alas, my frendes were all oppreſt.
            
            
               
               The bloudye Tyraunt brought them all to end
               Excepted me, which into Scotland ſkapt,
               To George of Dunbar therle of March, my frend,
               Who in my cauſe all that he could ey ſcrapt,
               And when I had for greater ſuccour gapte,
               Both at the Frenchmen and the Fleminges hande,
               And could get none, I tooke ſuch as I fand.
            
            
               And with the helpe of George my very frend,
               I did inuade Northumberland ful bold,
               Where as the folke drew to me ſtyl on end,
               Bent to death my partie to vphold:
               Through helpe of theſe ful many a fort and hold,
               The whiche the king right manfully had mand,
               I eaſely wonne and ſeaſed in my hand.
            
            
               Not ſo content (for vengeaunce draue me on)
               I entred Yorkeſhire there to waſt and ſpoyle,
               But ere I had farre in the countrye gone,

               And thence conueyed vs to the towne of Yorke,
               Vntil he knew what was the kinges entent,
               There loe Lord Bardolphe kynder then the Storke
               Did looſe his head, which was to London ſent,
               With whom for Frendſhip mine in like caſe went,
               This was my hap my fortune or my faute,
               This lyfe I led, and thus I came to naught.
            
            
               
               Wherfore good Baldwin wil the Piere
                     •
                   take heede,
               Of ſlaunder, malice, and conſpiracye,
               Of couetiſe, whence all the reſt procede:
               For couetiſe ioynt with contuniacye,
               Doth cauſe al miſchiefe in mens hartes to breede:
               And therfore this to Eſperance my worde,
               Who cauſeth Bloudſhed ſhal not eſcape the Sword.

               BY that this was ended, I had found oute
the ſtorye of Richard Earle of Cambridge:

                  •
               becauſe it conteyned matter in it, though
not very notable, yet for the better vnderſtandinge
of the reſt, I thought it meete to touche
it, and therfore ſayd as foloweth: You haue ſayde
wel of the Percies and fauourablye, for in deede as
it ſhould appeare, the chiefe cauſe of their conſpiracye
againſt K. Henry, was for Edmund Mortimer
their conſins ſake, whom the king very maliciouſlye
proclaymed to haue yelded himſelfe to Owen coulourably,
when as in deede hee was taken forciblye
againſt his wyl, and very cruelly ordered in Priſon
And ſeeing we are in hand with Mortimers matter,
I will take vppon me the perſon of Rycharde
Plantagenet earle of Cambridge, who for his ſake
lykewiſe dyed. And therefore I let paſſe Edmōd
Holland Earle of Kent, whom Henry the fowerth

made Admiral to ſkowre the Seas, becauſe yt Britaines
were abrode: which Earle (as many things
happen in warre) was ſlayne with an arrow at yt
Aſſaulte of Briack: ſhortly after whoſe death this
king dyed, and his ſonne Henrye the fyft of that
name ſucceeded in his place. In the beginning
of this Henry the fyftes raigne
dyed this Rychard, and with
him Hēry the L. Scrope
&amp; other, in whoſe behalfe,
this maye
be ſayde.
         
         
            
            HOVVE RICHARD
Plātagenet Earle of Cambridge
entending the Kinges deſtruction, was put to
death at Southampton. Anno.
Domini. 1415.
            
               
                  HAſt maketh waſt, hath commonly bene ſayde,
               And ſecrete miſchiefe ſeeld hath lucky ſpeede,
               A murdering minde with proper poyze is wayd,
               Al this moſt true I fynde it, as my creede,
               And therfore Baldwin wa
                     •
                  ne al ſtates take hede
               How they conſpyre any other to entrappe,
               Leaſt miſchiefement light in the meaners lappe.
            
            
               For I Lord Richard heire Plantagenet,
               Was Earle of Cambridge and right fortunate,
               If I had had the grace my witte to ſet,
               To haue content mee with myne owne eſtate:
               But O falſe honours, breeders of debate,
               The loue of you our lewde hartes do allure,
               To leeſe our ſelues by ſeeking you vnſure.
            
            
               Becauſe my brother Edmond Mortimer,
               Whoſe eldeſt ſiſter was my wedded wife,
               I meane that Edmund that was priſoner,
               In Wales ſo long through Owens buſie ſtryte,
               Becauſe I ſay that after Edmondes lyfe,
               His rightes and tytles muſt by law be myne,
               For he 
                     •
                  e had, nor could encreaſe his lygne.
            
            
               
               Becauſe the right of Realme and Crowne was ours,
               I ſearched meanes to helpe him thereunto,
               And where the Henries held it by their powers,
               I ſought a ſhift their tenures to vndoe,
               Which being force, ſith force or ſleight muſt doe:
               I voyde of might, becauſe their power was ſtrong,
               Ser priuy ſleight againſt their open wrong.
            
            
               But ſith the Death of moſt part of my kyn
               Did daſh my hope, through out the fathers dayes
               I let it ſlip, and thought it beſt begyn,
               Whan as the ſonne ſhould dred leaſt ſuch aſſayes,
               For force through ſpeede, ſleight ſpeedeth through delayes,
               And ſeeld doth treaſon time ſo fitlye fynde,
               As when all daungers moſt bee out of mynde.
            
            
               Wherfore while Henrye of that name the fift,
               Preparde his army to go conquer Fraunce,
               Lord Scrope and I thought to attempt a drift,
               To put him downe my brother to aduaunce,
               But were it Gods wyll, my lucke, or his good chaunce,
               The king wiſt wholly where about we went,
               The night before to ſhipward he him bent.
            
            
               Then were we ſtreight as traytours apprehended,
               Our purpoſe ſpyed, the cauſe thereof was hid,
               And therfore loe a falſe cauſe we pretended,
               Where through my brother was fro daunger ryd:
               We ſayd for hyre of French kings coyne, we did
               Behight to kyl the king: and thus with ſhame
               We ſtaynd our ſelues, to ſaue our frend fro blame.
            
            
               
               When wee had thus confeſt ſo foule a treaſon,
               That we deſerued, we ſuffered by the law,
               Se Baldwin ſee, and note as it is reaſon,
               How wicked deedes to woful endes do draw,
               Al force doth fayle no craft is worth a ſtraw,
               To attayne thinges loſt, and therfore let them goe.
               For might ruleth right, and wil though truth ſay no.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
               WHan ſtout Richarde had ſtoutly ſayde his
mynde, belike ſayd one, this Rychard was
but a little man, or els little fauoured of
writers, for our Chronicles ſpeake very litle of him
But ſeeing we become now to king Henries voyage
into Fraunce, we cannot lacke valiaunte men
to ſpeake of, for among ſo many as were led &amp; ſent
by the king out of this Realme thither, it cannot be
choſen but ſome, &amp; that a great ſomme, were ſlaine
among them: wherfore to ſpeake of thē al, I thinke
not needeful. And therefore to let paſſe Edwarde
Duke of Yorke, and the Earle of Suffolke, ſlayne
both at the Battayle of Agincourte, as were alſo
many other. Let vs end the tyme of Henry the fift,
and come to his ſonne Henry the ſyxte: whoſe Nonage
broughte Fraunce and Normandye 
                  •
               oute of
Bondage, and was the cauſe that ſo few of our noble
men dyed aged.
            
               
Of whom to let paſſe the number, I wil take vpō
mee the Perſonne of Thomas Montague Earle
of Saliſburie, whoſe name was not ſo good at
home (and yet he was called the good Earle) as it
was dreadful abroade: who exclaminge vppon
the mutability of Fortune, may iuſtlye ſay
in maner as folqweth.
         
         
            
            HOVVE THOMAS MONtague
Earle of Saliſburie, in the
middeſt of his glorie, was chaunceablye ſlayne at
Orliaunce with a peece of Ordinaunce the
third of Nouember. Anno
1428.
            
               
                  WHat fooles be we to truſt vnto our ſtrength,
               Our wyt, our courage, or our noble fame,
               Which time it ſelfe muſt needes deuour at length,
               Though froward fortune could not foyle the ſame
               But ſeeing this Goddeſſe guydeth all the game,
               Which ſtil to chaunge doth ſet her only luſt,
               Why toyle we ſo for thinges ſo hard to truſt,
            
            
               A goodly thing it is ſurely good report,
               Which noble hartes, do ſeeke by courſe of kinde:
               But ſeene the date ſo doubtful and ſo ſhort,
               The way ſo rough whereby wee do it fynde,
               I cannot choſe but prayſe the Princely mynde
               That preaſeth for it, though we fynde oppreſt,
               By foule defame thoſe that deſerue it beſt.
            
            
               Concerning whom marke Baldwin what I ſay
               I meane the vertuous hyndred of their brute,
               Among which nomber recken wel I may,
               My valiaunt father Iohn Lord Montacute,
               Who loſt his lyfe I iudge through iuſt purſute:
               I ſay the cauſe and not the caſuall ſpeede,
               Is to be wayde in euery kinde of deede.
            
            
               
               This rule obſerued, how many ſhall we fynde,
               For vertues ſake with infamie oppreſt:
               How many againe through helpe of Fortune blynde:
               For ill attemptes atchieued with honour bleſt:
               Succeſſe is worſt ofttimes when cauſe is beſt:
               Therfore ſay I: God ſend them ſory haps
               That iudge the cauſes by their after claps.
            
            
               The end in deede is iudge of euery thing,
               Which is the cauſe or latter point of time:
               The firſt true verdict at the firſt may bring,
               The laſt is ſlow, or ſlipper as the ſlyme,
               Oft chaunging names of innocence and crime:
               Duke Thomas death was Iuſtice two yeares long,
               And euer ſince, ſore tyranny and wrong.
            
            
               Wherfore I pray thee Baldwin way the cauſe,
               And praiſe my father as he doth deſerue,
               Becauſe Earle Henry, King againſt al lawes,
               Endeuoured king Rychard for to ſtarue
               In Iayle, whereby the regal crowne might ſwarue,
               Out of the ligne to which it than was due,
               (Whereby God knowes what euil myght enſue)
            
            
               My Lord Iohn Holland Duke of Exceſter,
               Which was deare coſin to this wretched king,
               Did moue my father and the Earle of Gloceſter,
               With other Lordes to ponder wel the thing:
               Who ſeeing the miſchiefe that began to ſpring,
               Did all conſent this Henry to depoſe,
               And to reſtore king Richard to the roſe.
            
            
               
               And while they did deuiſe a pretie trayne,
               Whereby to bring their purpoſe better about,
               Which was in Maſke this Henry to haue ſlayne,
               The Duke of Awmerle blew their counſel out:
               Yet was their purpoſe good there is no doubt.
               What cauſe can bee more worthy for a knight,
               Than ſaue his king, and helpe true heires to right?
            
            
               For this with them my father was deſtroyed,
               And buryed in the Dunghil of defame,
               Thus euil chaunce their glory did auoyde,
               Whereas their cauſe doth clayme eternal fame:
               When deedes therfore vnluckely do frame,
               Men ought not iudge the authours to be nought,
               For right through might is often ouerraught.
            
            
               And God doth ſuffer that it ſhould be ſo,
               But why, my wit is feeble to deciſe,
               Except it be to heape of wrath and woe
               On wicked heades that iniuries deuiſe:
               The cauſe why miſchiefes many times aryſe,
               And light on them yt would mens wronges redreſſe,
               Is for the tancour that they beare I geſſe.
            
            
               God hates rigour though it further right,
               For ſinne is ſynne, how euer it be vſed:
               And therfore ſuffereth ſhame and death to light,
               To puniſh vyce, though it be wel abuſed,
               Who furthereth right is not thereby excuſed.
               If through the ſame be do ſome other wrong,
               To euery vice due guerdon doth belong.
            
            
               
               What preache I now I am a man of warre,
               And that my body I dare ſay doth profeſſe,
               Of cured woundes beſet with manye a ſkarre,
               My broken Iaw vnhealde can ſay no leſſe,
               O Fortune, Fortune, cauſe of al diſtreſſe:
               My father had great cauſe thy fraud to curſe,
               But much more I, abuſed ten times worſe.
            
            
               Thou neuer flattredſt him in al thy lyfe,
               But me thou dandledſt like thy darling deare,
               Thy giftes I found in euery corner ryfe,
               Where euer I went I met thy ſmyling cheare:
               Which was not for a day, or for a yeare,
               But through the raigne of three right worthy kinges
               I found the forward in al kinde of thinges.
            
            
               The while King Henrye conquered in Fraunce,
               I ſued the warres, and ſtil found victory,
               In al aſſaultes ſo happy was my chaunce,
               Holdes yeld or wonne did make my enemies ſorye:
               Dame Prudence eke augmented ſo my glory,
               That in al treaties euer I was one,
               When waighty matters were agreed vpon.
            
            
               But whan this king this mighty conquerour.
               Through death vnrype was both his realmes bereft
               His ſeelye infant did receiue his power,
               Poore little babe ful young in Cradle left,
               Where crowne and Scepter 
                     •
                  urt him with the heft.
               Whoſe worthy Vncles had the gouernaunce,
               The one at home the other abroade in Fraunce.
            
            
               
               And I which was in peace and warre wel ſkylled,
               With both theſe rulers greatly was eſteemed:
               Bare rule at home as often as they wylled,
               And fought in France when they it needeful deemed,
               And euery where ſo good my ſeruice ſeemed.
               That Engliſh men to me great loue did beare,
               Our foes the French, my force fulfilled with feare.
            
            
               I alwayes thought it fitly for a Prince,
               And ſuch as haue the regiment of Realmes,
               His ſubiectes hartes with myldeneſſe to connince,
               With Iuſtice mixt, auoyding all extreames,
               For like as Phoebus with his cheareful beames,
               Doth freſhly force the fragrant flowers to floriſh,
               So rulers myldneſſe ſubiectes loue do noriſh.
            
            
               This found I true: for through my myeld behauiour
               Their hartes I had with me to lyue and dye,
               And in their ſpeach bewrayer of their fauour,
               They cald me ſtil good Earle of Saliſburie,
               The Lordes confeſt the commons did not lye:
               For vertuous lyfe, free hart, and lowly minde,
               With high and low ſhal alwayes fauour fynde.
            
            
               Which vertues chiefe become a man of warre,
               Whereof in Fraunce I found experience,
               For in aſſaultes due mildenes paſſeth farre
               Al rygour, for
                     •
                  e, and ſturdy violence,
               For men wil ſtoutly ſticke to their defence,
               When cruel Captaynes couet after ſyoyle,
               And ſo enforſt, oft giue their foes the foyle.
            
            
               
               But when they know they ſhalbe frendly vſed,
               They hazard not their heades but rather yeilde,
               For this my offers neuer were refuſed
               Of any towne, or ſurely very ſield,
               But force and furies fit be for the fielde,
               And there in deede I vſed ſo the ſame,
               My foes would flye if they but heard my name.
            
            
               For whan Lord Steward &amp; Earle Vantadore,
               Had cruellye beſieged Crauant towne,
               Which he had wonne, and kept long time before,
               Which lyeth in Awxer on the ryuer Youne:
               To rayſe the ſiege the regent ſent me downe:
               Whereas I vſed all rigour that I might,
               I kylled all that were not ſaued by flight.
            
            
               When therle of Bedforde then in Fraunce Lord Regent,
               Knew in what ſort I had remoued the ſiege,
               In Brye and Champaigne he made me Vicegerent,
               And Lieutenaunt for him and for my liege:
               Which cauſed me to goe to Brye, and there beſiege
               Montagui
                     •
                  lon with twentie weekes aſſaut,
               Which at the laſt was yelded me for naught.
            
            
               And for the Duke of Bretaines brother Arthur,
               Both Earle of Rychmond and of Yuery,
               Againſt his oth from vs had made departure,
               To Charles the Dolphin our chiefe enemie,
               I wi
                     •
                  h the Regent went to Normandie:
               To take his towne of Yuery which of ſpight,
               Did to vs dayly al the harme they might.
            
            
               
               They at the firſt compounded by a daye
               To yeld, if reſcues did not come before,
               And while in hope to fight we at it laye,
               The Dolphin gathered men two thouſand ſkore,
               With Earles, Lordes, and Captaynes ioly ſtore,
               Of which the Duke of Alanſon was guyde,
               And ſent them downe to ſee if we would byde.
            
            
               But they left vs and downe to Vernoyle went,
               And made their vaunt they had our armye ſlayne,
               And through that lye the towne from vs they hent,
               Which ſhortly after turned to their payne:
               For there both armies met vpon the playne:
               And we eight thouſand whom they flew, not ſlew before,
               Did kil of them ten thouſand men and more.
            
            
               When wee had taken Vernoyle thus agayne,
               To driue the Dolphin vtterly out of Fraunce,
               The Regent ſent me to Aniow and to Mayne,
               Where I beſieged the warlike towne of Mauns
               There Lord of Toyſers Baldwines valiaunce
               Did wel appeare, which would not yeld the towne,
               Tyl al the Towers and walles were battred downe.
            
            
               But here now Baldwin take it in good part,
               Though that I brought this Baldwin there to yeld,
               The Lyon fierce for all his noble hart,
               Being ouermatched, is forſt to flye the field,
               If Mars himſelfe there had bene with his ſhield,
               And in my ſtormes had ſtoutly me with ſtoed,
               He ſhould haue yeld, or els haue ſhed my bloud.
            
            
               
               This worthy knight both hardy ſtout and wyſe,
               Wrought wel his feate, as time and place require,
               When Fortune fayles, it is the beſt aduiſe
               To ſtryke the ſayle leaſt all lye in the myre,
               This haue I ſayde to thend thou take no ire:
               For though no cauſe be found, ſo nature frames,
               Men haue a zeale to ſuch as beare their names.
            
            
               But to returne, in Mayne wan I at length,
               Such townes and Fortes as might eyther helpe or hurt,
               I manned Mayon, and Suzans towne of ſtrength,
               Fore Barnard, Thanceaur, and S. Cales the curt,
               With Lile, ſues, Bolton, ſtanding in the durt:
               Eke Guerland, Suze, Loupeland, and Mountſure,
               With Malicorne, theſe wanne I and kept ful ſure.
            
            
               Beſides all this I tooke nere fourtie holdes,
               But thoſe I razed euen with the ground,
               And for theſe deedes, as ſeely ſheepe in foldes,
               Do ſhrinke for feare at euery little ſound,
               So fled my foes before my face ful round:
               Was none ſo hardy that durſt abyde my fight,
               So Mars and Fortune furthered me their knight.
            
            
               I tel no lye ſo gaſtful grew my name,
               That it alone diſcomfited an hoaſt,
               The Scots and Frenchmen wel confeſſe the ſame,
               Els wil the towne which they like Cowardes loſt,
               For whan they ſieged Beauron with great boaſt:
               Being fourty thouſand Brytaynes, French and Scots,
               Fiue hundred men did vanquiſh them like ſots.
               
                  For while the Frenchmen freſhlye aſſaulted ſtil,
               Our Engliſh men came boldly foorth at night,
               Cryinge S. George, Saliſburye, kyl, kyl, kyl,
               And offced freſhlye with their foes to fight,
               And they as frenchly tooke themſelues to flight,
               Suppoſing ſurely that I had beene there,
               See how my name did pu
                     •
                  them al in feare.
            
            
               Thus was the Dolphins power diſcomfited,
               Fowre thouſand ſlaine, their Campe tane as it ſtoode,
               Whereby our Towne and ſouldiers proficed,
               For there were vitailes plenteous and good,
               This while was I in England by the Roode,
               To appeaſe a ſtrife that was right foule befall,
               Betwene Duke Humfrey and the Cardinal.
            
            
               The Duke of Exceſter ſhortly after dyed,
               Which of the King at home had gouernaunce.
               Whoſe roume the Earle of Warwicke then ſupplyed,
               And I tooke his and ſped me into Fraunce,
               And hauing zeale to conquere Orliaunce,
               With much a do I gat the Regentes ayde,
               And marched thyther, and ſiege about it layde.
            
            
               But in the way I tooke the towne of Yane,
               Where murthered were for ſtoutneſſe many a man:
               But Baugencey I tooke with little payne.
               For which to ſhew them fauour I began:
               This cauſed the townes of Mewne and Iargeman,
               That ſtoode on Loyer: to profer me the keyes,
               Ere I came nere them, welny by two dayes.
            
            
               
               See here how Fortune forward can allure,
               What Baytes ſhe layeth to bring men to their endes
               Who hauing hap like this, but hopeth ſure,
               To bring to 
                     •
                  ale what euer hee entendes?
               But ſone is ſower the ſweete that fortune ſendes:
               Whan hope and hap, whan health and wealth is hieſt
               Then woe and wracke, diſeaſe, and neede be nyeſt.
            
            
               For while I, ſuing this ſo good ſucceſſe,
               Layde ſiege to Orliaunce on the Riuer ſide,
               The Baſtard (Cuckold Cawnies ſonne I geſſe,
               Tho thought the Dukes) who had the towne in guyde
               Came fiercely foorth, when hee his time eſpyed,
               To rayſe the ſiege but was bet backe agayne,
               And hard purſued both to his loſſe and payne.
            
            
               For there we wan the Bulworke on the Bridge,
               With a mighty tower ſtanding faſt thereby.
               Ah curſed tower that didſt my dayes abridge,
               Would God thou hadſt bene furder eyther I:
               For in this tower a chamber ſtandes on hye,
               From which a man may view through all the towne
               By certain wyndowes iron grated downe.
            
            
               Where on a daye, now Baldwin note myne ende,
               I ſtoode in viewing where the towne was weake,
               And as I buſilye talked with my frend,
               Shot fro the towne, which al the Grate did breake,
               A pellet came and droue a mighty fleake
               Againſt my face, and care away my cheeke,
               For payne whereof I dyed within a weeke.
            
            
               
               See Baldwin ſee the vncertayne glorye,
               How ſodaine miſchiefe daſheth all to duſt,
               And warne al Princes by my broken ſtorye,
               The bappieſt Fortune chieflye to miſtruſt,
               Was neuer man that alway had his luſt:
               Than ſac

                  b be fooles, in fancy more then mad,
               Which hope to haue that neuer any had.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
               THis ſtraunge aduenture of the good earle
draue vs al into a dumpe, inwardly lamē
               ting
his woful deſtenye, out of which wee
were awaked after this ſort.
            To what ende (ſaid one) muſe wee ſo much on the
matter. This Earle is neither the fyrſte nor laſte
whom fortune hath foundred in the height of their
proſperity. For al through the raigne of this vnfortunate
kinge Henrye, wee ſhal fynde many which
haue been likewiſe ſerued, whoſe chances ſith they
be martial, &amp; therfore honorable, may the better bee
omitted. And therefore we will let go the Lordes
Molines, and Poyninges, ſlayne both at the ſiege
of Orleaunce, ſhortly after the death of this Earle.
Alſo the valiaunt Earle of Arundel deſtroied with
a bowlet at the aſſault of Gerborye, whoſe ſtories
neuertheleſſe are worth the hearing. And to quickē
               
vp your ſpirites, I wil take vpon me a tragical perſon
in deede, I meane kinge Iamy ſlayne by his ſeruauntes
in his priuy Chamber: who although he be
a Scot, yet ſeeing he was brought vp in England,
where hee learned the language, his example
alſo ſo notable, it were not meete it ſhould
be forgotten. And therefore marke
Baldwyn what I thinke
hee may ſay.

            HOW KING IAMES THE
firſt for breaking his othes and bonds
was by Gods ſufferaunce miſerably murdered of his
owne Subiectes. Anno. 1437.
            
               
                  IF for examples ſake thou wrote thy Booke,
               I chardge thee Baldwin thou forget mee not,
               Whom fortune alwayes frowardly forſooke.
               Sutch was my lucke, my merite or my lot.
               I am that Iames King Roberts Sonne the Scot,
               That was in England Priſoner all his youth,
               Through mine vncle Walters trayterous vntruth.
            
            
               For whan my Father through diſeaſe and age,
               Vnwieldy was to gouerne well his Land,
               Bycauſe his Brother Walter ſeemed ſage,
               Hee put the rule thereof into his hand.
               Than had my Father, you ſhall vnderſtand,
               Of lawfull Barnes, mee and one onely other,
               Nempt Dauy Rothſay, who was mine elder Brother.
            
            
               This Dauy was Prince of Scotland and ſo take,
               Till his aduoutry cauſed men complayne:
               VVhich that hee might by moniſhment forſake,
               My Father prayed myne Vncle take the payne.
               To threaten him his vices to refrayne.
               But hee falſe Traytour butcherly murderinge wretch,
               To get the Crowne began to fetch a fetch,
            
            
               
               And fynding now a proffer to his praye,
               Deuiſed meanes my brother to deuour,
               And for that cauſe conuayed him day by day
               From place to place, from Caſtel vnto tower,
               To Faulkland fort, where like a tormentour
               He ſtarued him, and put to death a wyfe,
               Whom through a Reede he ſuckt to ſaue his lyfe.
            
            
               O wretched death, fye cruell tyrannye,
               A Prince in priſon loſt for fault of foode:
               Was neuer enmie wrought ſuch vilany,
               A truſty brother deſtroy his brothers blood,
               VVo worth ſo frendlye, fye on double hood,
               Ah wretched father ſee thy ſoone is loſt,
               Sterued by thy brother whom thou truſtedſt moſt.
            
            
               Of whom when ſome began to fynde the fraud,
               And yet the traytour made himſelfe ſo cleare,
               That he ſhould ſeeme to haue deſerued laud,
               So woful did he for his Prince appeare,
               My doubtful father louing me ful deare.
               To auoyde all daunger that might after chaunce,
               Sent mee away but nyne yeares old to Fraunce.
            
            
               But windes and weather were ſo contrary,
               That we were driuen to thengliſh coaſt,
               Which Realme with Scotland at that time did varye,
               So that they tooke me as priſoner not as hoaſt:
               For which my father fearing I was loſt,
               Conceiued ſhortlye ſuch an inward thought,
               As to the graue immediatly him brought,
            
            
               
               Than had myne vncle all the regiment
               At home, and I in England priſoner lay.
               For to himſelfe he thought it detriment,
               For my releaſe any raunſome for to pay,
               For as hee thought he had poſſeſt his pray:
               And therfore wiſht I might in duraunce dure,
               Til I had dyed, ſo ſhould his raigne be ſure.
            
            
               But good king Henrye ſeeing I was a childe,
               And heir by right vnto a realme and crowne,
               Did bring mee vp not (like my brother) wyloe,
               But vertuouſlye in feates of high renowne?
               In I beral artes, in inſtrumental ſowne:
               By meane whereof when I was after king,
               I did my realme to ciuel order bring.
            
            
               For ere I had been priſoner eightene yeare,
               In which ſhort ſpace two noble Princes dyed,
               Whereof the firſt in prudence had no peere,
               The other in warre moſt valiaunt throughly tryed,
               Whoſe roume his ſonne babe Henry eke ſupplied:
               The peeres of England which did gouerne all,
               Did of their goodneſſe helpe me out of thrall.
            
            
               They maryed me to a coſin of their king,
               The Duke of Somerſets daughter rich and fayre,
               Relcaſt my raunſome ſaue a trifling thing:
               And after I had done homage to the heyre,
               And ſworne my frendſhip neuer ſhould appayre,
               They brought me kingly furniſht to my land,
               Which I receiued at myne vncles hand.
            
            
               
               Whereof my Lordes and commons were ful glad,
               So was mine vncle chieflye as he ſayed,
               Who in his mouth no other matter had,
               Saue puniſh ſuch as hab my brother trayed:
               The fault whereof apparauntly he layed,
               To good Duke Murdo, his elder brothers ſonne,
               Whoſe father dyed long ere this was done.
            
            
               My curſed vncle ſlyer than the ſnake,
               Which would by craft vnto the crowne aſpire,
               Becauſe be ſaw this Murdo was a ſtake,
               That ſtayed vp the top of his deſire.
               (For his elder brother was Duke Murdoes ſyre)
               He thought it beſt to haue him made away,
               So was he ſure (I gone) to haue his praye.
            
            
               And by his craftes the traytour brought to paſſe,
               That I deſtroyed Duke Murdo and his kin,
               Poore innocentes, my louing frendes alas.
               O Kinges and Princes what plight ſtand we in,
               A truſted traytour ſhal you quickly win,
               To put to death your kin and frendes moſt iuſt,
               Take heede therfore, take heede whoſe reede ye truſt.
            
            
               And at the laſt to bring me hole in hate,
               With God and man at home and eke abrode,
               He counſaild me for ſuraunce of my ſtate:
               To helpe the Frenchmen, then nigh ouertrode
               By Engliſhmen: and more to lay on lede,
               With power and force al England comu

               And though at fyrſt my conſcience dyd grudge,
               To breake the boundes of frendſhip knit by oth
               Yet after proafe (ſee miſchiefe) I did iudge,
               Iemadneſſe for a king to keepe his troth,
               And ſemblably with al the world it goth:
               Synnes oft aſſayed are thought to be no ſinne,
               So ſoyleth ſinne the ſoule it ſinketh in.
            
            
               But as diſeaſes common cauſe of death,
               Bring daunger moſt, when leaſt they pricke and ſmart,
               Which is a ſigne they haue expulſt the breath
               Of liuely heate which doth defend the hart:
               Euen ſo ſuch ſinnes as felt are on no part

               So kild the ſoule that it can haue no cure.
            
            
               And grace agate, vyce ſtil ſuccedeth vyce,
               And al to haſt the vengeaunce for the furſt,
               I areade therfore al people to be wiſe,
               And ſtop the bracke when it beginnes to burſt,

               When I had learnde to ſet my oth at nought,
               And through much vſe the ſence of ſinne exiled.
               Againſt King Henry what I could I wrought,
               My fayth my oth vniuſtly fowle defiled,
               And while ſlye Fortune at my doinges ſmyled,

               Fel on my necke, for thus loe was I ſerued.
            
            
               
               Ere I had raygned fully fiftene yeare,

               My murdrynge vncle with the double face,
               That longed for my kyngdome and my mace,
               To ſlay me there ſuborned Robert Grame,
               With whom his nephue, Robert ſtuart came.
            
            
               And when their tyme fit for their purpoſe found,
               Into my priuy chamber they aſtart,
               Wherwith their ſwoordes they gaue me many a wound,
               And ſlue al ſuch as ſtuck vnto my part
               There loe my wife did ſhew her louing hart,
               Who to defend me felied one or twayne.
               And was ſore wounded ere I could be ſlayne.

               Thus of a Damſel a Ducheſſe I became,
               My ſtate and place aduaunced next the Queene
               Wherby me thought I felt no ground, but ſwam

               Aboue all Ladyes aduaunced in degree
               (The Quene except) no Princeſſe was my peere
               But gaue me place, and lords with cap and knee

               And weening leaſt that fortune hath a turne,
               I lookt aloft, and would not looke alow,
               The brondes of pryde ſo in my breaſt did burne
               As the hot ſparkes, burſt forth in open ſhowe,
               And more and more the fyre began to glowe,
               Without quenching, and dayly did encreaſe,
               Til fortunes blaſtes with ſhame did make it ceaſſe.

               Wold beare in mynde, and truſt it▪ as their Crede▪
               
               That pryde of harte, is a moſt hateful vice,
               And lowlines, a pearle of paſſing pryce.
            
            
               Namely in Quenes, and Ladies of eſtate
               Within whoſe myndes, al mekenes ſhould abound
               Since high diſdayne, doth alwayes purchace hate.
               Beyng a vyce, that moſt part doth redound
               To their reproch, in whom the ſame is found.
               And ſeeldome gets good fauour or good fame
               Bat is at laſt, knit vp with worldly ſhame.
            
            
               The proofe whereof I founde moſt true indede,
               That pryde afore, hath ſhame to wayte behynde.
               Let no man doubt, in whom this vice doth brede,
               But ſhame for pryde by iuſtice is aſſynde,
               Which I wel founde, for truely in my mynde
               Was neuer none, whom pryde did more enflame,
               Nor neuer none, receiued greatter ſhame.
            
            
               
               For not content to be a Ducheſſe greate,
               I longed ſore to beare the name of Queene
               Aſpyring ſtil vnto an higher ſeate,
               And with that hope my ſelfe did euerweene
               Sins there was none, which that tyme was betweene
               Henry the king, and my good Duke his Eame
               Heyre to the crowne and kingdome of this Realme.
            
            
               So neare to be, was cauſe of my vayn hope
               And long awayte when this fayre hap would fal.
               My ſtudies all were tending to that ſcope,
               Alas, the whyle to councel I did call
               Such as would ſeme, by ſkill coniectural
               Of art Magicke and wicked Sorcery
               To deeme and dyuine the princes deſteny
            
            
               Among which ſort of thoſe that bare moſt fame
               There was a Beldame called the wytch of Ey,
               Old mother Madge her neyghbours did hir name
               Which wrought wonders in countryes by hereſaye
               Both feendes and fayries her charmyng would obay
               And dead corpſis from graue ſhe could vprere
               Suche an Inchauntreſſe, as that tyme had no peere

               To caſt and calke, the kinges conſtellation
               And then to iudge by depe dyuination.
               Of thinges to come, and who ſhould next ſuccede
               To Englandes crowne, al this was true in deede.
            
            
               
               And further ſure they neuer did proceede
               Though I confeſſe, that this attempt was ill,
               But for my part, for any thing in dede
               Wrought, or els thought, by any kynd of ſkill.
               God is my iudge I neuer had the will
               By any Inchauntment ſorcery or charme
               Or other wyſe, to worke my princes harme.

               Glad of the chance, ſo fitly forth to fall

               Before Iudges, in place Iudiciall
               Whereas Cayphas, ſytting in his glory
               Would not allow my anſwer diſatory
               Ne Doctor or Proctor, to allege the lawes.
               But forced me to pleade in myne owne cauſe.
            
            
               The kynges councel were called to the caſe

               In whoſe abſence I found but little grace
               For Lawiers turned our offence to treaſon
               And ſo with rigor, without ruth or reaſon
               Sentence was gyuen that I for the ſame
               Should do penance, and ſuffer open ſhame.

               For they to bring me to beggers ſtate moſt bars
               By the ſame acte, from me did then withdraw.
               Such right of dower, as widowes haue by law.
            
            
               Death (as tis ſayd) doth ſet al thinges at reſt,
               Which fel not ſo in myne vnhappy caſe,
               For ſins my death, myne enmies made a Ieſt
               In minſtrels ryme myne honour to deface.
               And then to bring my name in more diſgrace
               A ſong was made in manner of a laye
               Which old wyues ſing of me vnto this day.
            
            
               
               Yet with theſe ſpytes, theyr malice did not end
               For ſhortly after, my ſorrowes to renew
               My Loyal Lord, which neuer did offende
               Was cald in haſt, the cauſe he little knew
               To a Parliament, without Sommons due
               Whereas his death, was cruelly contryued
               And I his wyfe of earthly ioyes depryued.
            
            
               For al the while my Duke had life &amp; breath
               So long I ſtoode, in hope of my reſtore
               But when I hard of his moſt cauſeles death
               Then the beſt ſalue for my recureles ſore
               Was to diſpayre of cure for euermore,
               And as I could, my careful hart to cure.
               With pacience, moſt paynful to indure.
            
            
               O Traitors fel, which in your hartes could fynde!
               Like frendes of hel, the guiltles to betraye

               If noble byrth or high authoritie
               Nomber of Frendes, kindred, or alliaunce,
               If wiſedome, learning, or worldly pollicye
               Mought haue beene ſtayers to Fortunes variaunce,
               None ſtoode more ſtrong, in worldly countenaunce,
               For al theſe helpes had I to auayle mee,
               And yet in fyne, al the ſame did fayle mee.
            
            
               Of King Henry the fourth, fourth ſonne I was
               Brother to Henry, the fyft of that name,
               And vncle to Henry the ſixt, but alas,
               What cauſe had I to preſume on the ſame?
               Or for vayne glorye, aduauncing my fame
               My ſelfe to cal in recordes, and wrytinges,
               The ſonne, brother, and vncle vnto kinges.
            
            
               
               This was my boaſt, which laſtly was my bane,
               Yet not this boaſt, was it that brought mee downe
               The verye uſe, which made my weale to wane
               So neere of Kin that I was to the Crowne,
               That was the Rocke that made my Ship to drowne.
               A rule there is not faylinge, but moſt ſure
               Kingdome, no kyn doth know, ne can indure.
            
            
               For after my Brother the fyft Henry
               Wan by Conqueſt the Royall Realme of Fraunce,
               And of two Kingdomes made one Monarchy
               Before his death, for better obeyſaunce.
               To his younge Sonne, not ripe to gouernaunce
               Protector of England I was by Teſtament,
               And Ihon my Brother, in Fraunce made Regent.
            
            
               To whom if God had lent a longer life,
               Our houſe to haue kept from ſtormes of inward ſtrife
               Or it had beene the Lorde Almighties will
               Plantagenettes name in State had ſtanden ſtill
               But deadly diſcord which Kingdomes great doth ſpill
               Bred by deſire of high Dominacion,
               Brought our whole houſe to playde deſolation.
            
            
               It is for trowth in an Hiſtory Founde
               That Henry Plantagenet fyrſt of our name
               Who called was, Kinge Henry the ſeconde
               Sonne of Dame Mawde, the Empreſſe of High Fame
               Would oft report, that his Auncient Grandame
               Though ſeeminge in Shape, a Woman naturall,
               Was a Feende of the Kinde that (Succubae) ſome call.
            
            
               
               VVhich olde fable, ſo longe time tolde before
               When this Kinges ſonnes againſt him did rebell:
               Hee cald to minde, and beinge greeued ſore.
               Loe! now (quoth hee) I ſee and proue full well
               The Story true, which folke of old did tell
               That from the deuill deſcended all our race,
               And now my children, do verefy the caſe.

               Meaninge hereby, his rebell children three
               Henry, and Richard who bet him on the breſt:
               Ieffrey only, from that offence was free)
               Henry died of Englandes, Crowne poſſeſt:

               VVhoſe deedes vnkinde, the ſooner made hym dye.
            
            
               This kinge (ſome wryte) in his ſickneſſe laſt
               Sayde, as it were by way of Prophecy
               How that the Deuill, a Darnell grayne had caſt
               Amonge his Kin to encreaſe enmity,
               Which ſhould remayne in their Poſterity,
               Till miſchiefe, and murder had ſpent them all
               Not leauinge one to piſſe agaynſt the wall.
            
            
               
               And yet from him in order did ſuccede
               In England here of crowned kinges fourtene
               Of that ſurname, and of that lyne and ſeede,
               With Dukes and Earles, and many a noble Queene,
               The number ſuch as al the world would weene
               So many ympes could neuer ſo be ſpent,
               But ſome heire Male, ſhould be of that diſcent.
            
            
               Which to be true if any ſtand in doubt,
               Becauſe I meane not further to digreſſe,
               Let him peruſe the ſtories throughout
               Of Engliſh kinges, whom practiſe did oppreſſe,
               And he ſhal fynde the cauſe of their diſtreſſe
               From firſt to laſt, vnkindly to beginne,
               Alwayes by thoſe that next were of the kynne.
            
            
               Was not Richard, of whom I ſpake before,
               A rebel playne vntil his father dyed,
               And Iohn likewiſe an Enmie euermore
               To Richard againe, and for a rebel tryed?
               After whoſe death, it cannot be denyed,
               Againſt all right this Iohn moſt cruellye
               His brothers children cauſed for to dye.
            
            
               Arthur and Iſabell (I meane) that were
               Geffreyes children, then Duke of Britaine
               Henries third ſonne, by one degree more neere,
               Then was this Iohn, as ſtories ſhew moſt playne,
               Which two children were famiſht or els ſlayne,
               By Iohn their Eame cald Saunzterre by name,
               Of whoſe fowle act, al countries ſpeake great ſhame.
            
            
               
               Edward, and Richard, ſecond both by name
               Kinges of this land, fel downe by fatall fate
               What was the cauſe, that princes of ſuch fame,
               Did leeſe at laſt their honour, life, and ſtate?
               Nothing at all, but diſcord and debate,
               Which when it haps in kindred or in bloud,
               
                  Erynnis rage was neuer halfe ſo wood.
            
            
               Be ſure therfore ye kinges and princes all
               That concorde in kingdomes is chiefe aſſuraunce,
               And that your families do neuer fall,
               But where diſcord doth leade the doubtful daunce
               With buſie brawles and turnes of variaunce,
               Where mallice is Minſtrel, the pype ill report,
               The Maſke miſchiefe, and ſo endes the ſport,
            
            
               But now to come to my purpoſe againe,
               Whilſt I
                     •
                  my charge applied in England,
               My brother in Fraunce long time did remaine,
               Cardinal Beauford tooke proudly in hand,
               In cauſes publique againſt me to ſtand,
               Who of great mallice ſo much as he might
               Sought in al thinges to do mee diſpight.
            
            
               Which proude prelate to me was baſtard Eame,
               Sonne to Duke Iohn of Gaunt as they did fayne,
               Who beeing made high Chauncellour of the Realme,
               Not like a Prieſt, but like a prince did reigne,
               Nothing wanting which might his pride mainteine,
               Biſhop beſides of VVincheſter he was,
               And Cardinall of Rome which Angels brought to paſſe.
            
            
               
               Not Gods Aungels, but Angels of old Gold,
               Lyfe him aloft in whom no cauſe there was
               By iuſt deſert, ſo high to be extold,
               (Ryches except) where by this Golden aſſe,
               At home and abroade al matters brought to paſſe,
               Namely at Rome, hauing no meane but that
               To purchaſe there his crimzin Cardinal hat.
            
            
               Which thing the king my father him forbad
               Playnly ſaying, that he could not abide,
               Within his realme a ſubiect to be had
               His Princes peere, yet ſuch was this mans pride,
               That he forthwith after my father dyed,
               (The King then young) obteyned of the Pope,
               That honour high, which erſt he could not hope.
            
            
               Whoſe proude attemptes becauſe that I with ſtoode,
               My bounden dutie the better to acquite,
               This holy father waxed welnere wood,
               Of meere malice deuiſing day and night,
               To worke to me diſhonour and diſpite,
               Whereby there fel betweene vs ſuch a Iarre,
               As in this land was like a ciuil warre.
            
            
               My brother Iohn which lay this while in Fraunce,
               Heardof this hurle, and paſt the ſeas in haſt,
               By whoſe traueil this troubleſome diſtaunce,
               Ceaſſed a while, but netheleſſe in waſt:
               For rooted hate wil hardly be diſplaſt
               Out of hyghe hartes, and namely where debate,
               Happeneth amongſt great perſons of eſtate,
            
            
               
               For like as a match deth lye and ſmolder,
               Long time before it commeth to the trayne.
               But yet when fyre hath caught in the poulder,
               No arte is able, the flames to reſtrayne:
               Euen ſo the ſparkes of enuye and diſdayne,
               Out of the ſmoke burſt foorth in ſuch a flame,
               That Fraunce and England yet may rue the ſame.
            
            
               So when of two realmes the regiment royal,
               Betwene brothers was parced equallye,
               One placed in Fraunce for affayres Martiall,
               And I at home for ciuil pollicie:
               To ſerue the ſtate, we both did ſo applie,
               As honour and fame to both did encreaſe,
               To him for the warre, to me for the peace.
            
            
               Whence enuye ſprang, and ſpecially becauſe
               This proude prelate could not abyde a Peere,
               Within the land to rule the ſtate by lawes,
               Wherfore lifting my lyfe and actes moſt neere,
               He neuer ceaſt, vntil as you ſhal beare,
               By practiſe foule of him and his allies,
               My death was wrought in moſt vnworthy wiſe.
            
            
               And fyrſt he ſought my doinges to defame,
               By rumours falſe, which hee and his did ſowe
               Letters and hylles to my reproch and ſhame
               He did deuiſe, and al about beſtow,
               Whereby my troch in doubt ſhould dayly agow,
               In England fyrſt and afterward in Fraunce,
               Mouing al meanes to bring me to miſchaunce.
            
            
               
               One quarel was, that where by common law
               Murder and theft beene puniſht all alike,
               So as manſlears, which bloudy blades do drawe,
               Suffer no more, then he that doth but pike,
               Me thought the ſame no order politike,
               In ſetting paynes to make no difference,
               Betweene the leſſer and greater offence.
            
            
               I beeing ſeene ſomwhat in ciuil law,
               The rules thereof reputed muche better,
               Wherfore to keepe, offenders more in awe,
               Like as the fault was ſmaller or greater,
               So ſet I paynes more eaſier or bitter,
               Waying the qualitie of euerye offence,
               And ſo according pronounced ſentence,
            
            
               Amongſt my other Delicta Iuuentutis,
               
               Whilſt rage of youth my reaſon did ſubdue,
               I muſt confeſſe as the very truth is,
               Driuen by deſire, fond fancies to enſue,
               A thing I did, whereof great trouble grew,
               Abuſing one to my no ſmall rebuke,
               VVhich wife was than to Iohn of Brabant Duke.
            
            
               Called ſhe was Lady Iaquet the fayre,
               Delightful in loue like Helene of Troye:
               To the Duke of Bauier ſole daughter and heire,
               Her did I marrye to my great annoy
               Yet for a tyme, this dame I did enioye,
               VVith her whole landes, witholding them by force,
               Til, Martin the Pope, betwene vs made diuorce.
            
            
               
               Yet all theſe blaſtes not hable were to moue
               The anchor ſtrong, whereby my ſhip did ſtay,
               Some other ſhift to ſeeke him did behoue,
               Whereto ere long il fortune made the way,
               Which fynally was cauſe of my decay
               And cruel death, contriued by my foes,
               Which fel out thus, as now I ſhal diſcloſe.
            
            
               Elianor my wife, my Dutches only deare,
               I know not how but as the nature is
               Of women al, aye carious to enquiere
               Of thinges to came (though I confeſſe in this
               Her fault not ſmall) and that ſhee did an iſſe,
               By wytches ſkill, which ſorcery ſome call,
               Would know of thinges which after ſhould befall.
            
            
               And for that cauſe made her ſelfe acquainted
               With mother Madge, called the wytch of Eye,
               And with a Clerke that after was attaited,
               Bolenbroke he hight, that learned was that way,
               With other moe, which famous were that daye,
               Aſwel in Science, called Mathematicall,
               As alſo in magicke and ſkil ſupernatural
            
            
               Theſe cunning folkes ſhe ſet on worke to know,
               The time how long the king ſhould liue and raigne,
               Same by the Starres, and ſome by deuils below,
               Some by witchcraft ſought knowledge to attayne,
               VVith like fancies, friuolous fond and vayne,
               Whereof though I knew leaſt of any man,
               Yet by that meane my miſchiefe firſt began.
            
            
               
               Yet beſides this there was a greater thing,
               How ſhe in waxe by counſel of the witch,
               An Image made, crowned like a king,
               VVith ſword in hand, in ſhape and likeneſſe ſyche
               As was the kinge, which dayly they did pytch
               Againſt a fyre, that as the waxe did melt,
               So ſhould his lyfe conſume away vnfelt.
            
            
               My Dutcheſſe thus, accuſed of this cryme,
               As ſhe that ſhould ſuch practiſe firſt beginne,
               My part was then to yeld vnto the time,
               Geeuing her leaue, to deale alone therein
               And ſince the cauſe concerned deadly ſynne,
               Which to the clergie onely doth perteine,
               To deale therein I plainly did refrayne.
            
            
               And ſuffered them her perſon to aſcite
               Into their Courtes, to aunſwere and appeare,
               Which to my hart was ſure the greateſt ſpight,
               That cauld be wrought, and touched me moſt neare,
               To ſee my wife, and lady leefe and deare,
               To my reproche, and plaine before my face,
               Entreated ſe, as one of ſorte moſt baſe.
            
            
               The clergie then examining her cauſe,
               Conuinced her, as guiltie in the ſame,
               And ſentence gaue according to their lawes,
               That ſhe and they whom I before did name
               Should ſuffer death, or els ſome open ſhame:
               Of which penaunce my wife by ſentence had
               To ſuffer ſhame of both the two, more bad.

               Bearing in hand a burning taper bright,

               To worke mee wo, in al they may or can,

               This haynous crime and open worldly ſhame,
               With ſuch rigour ſhewed vnto my wife,
               Was a fyne fetch further thinges to frame,
               And nothing els, but a preparatiue
               Firſt from office, and fynally from lyfe,

               Which by ſlye driftes, and wyndlaces aloofe,
               They brought about, perſwading firſt the Queene,
               That in effect it was the kinges reproofe,
               And hers alſo, to be exempted cleane,
               From princely rule, or that it ſhould be ſeene
               A king of yeares, ſtil gouerned to bee
               Lyke a Pupil, that nothing could forſee.
            
            
               The daunger more conſidering the king
               Was without childe, I being his next heire,

               Without reſtraint, and al the ſway to beare
               With Peoples loue, whereby it was to feare
               That my hault hart, vnbrideled in deſire,
               Time would preuent, and to the crowne aſpire,

               Who keeping cloſe a tytle to the crowne,
               Lancaſters houſe did labour to pul oowne.
            
            
               The ſtay whereof he tooke to ſtand in mee,
               Seeing the king of courage nothing ſtout,
               Neither of wit great peril to foreſee,
               So for purpoſe, if he could bring about

               This hope made him againſt me to conſpyre

               The Dukes two, of Exceſter, and Buckingham,
               With the Marquiſe Dorſet therein did agree,

               Which otherwiſe (Ambition) hath to name,
               So ſtirde the Queene that wilful as a Mule,
               Headlong ſhe runnes, from ſmoke into the flame,
               Driuing a drife, which after did ſo frame,
               As ſhee, the King, with all their lyne and race,
               Depriued were of honour, lyfe, and place.

               With former foes, in frendſhip to confeder,

               Concluding thus they point without delay
               Parliament to hold, in ſome vnhaunted place,
               Far from London, out of the common way,
               Where fewor none ſhould vnderſtand the caſe,

               And ſo for place they choſe Saint Edmondeſburye

               Somens was ſent, this companie to call,

               Defended it as long as ere he might
            
            
               
               But what preuayled it theſe Townes to win,
               VVhich ſhortly after muſt be loſt agayne?
               VVhereby I ſee there is more glory in
               The keepinge thinges than is in their attayne:
               To get and keepe not, is but loſſe of payne.
               Therefore ought men prouide to ſaue their winninges
               In all attemptes, els loſe they their beginninges.
            
            
               Becauſe we could not keepe the Townes wee won,
               For they were more than we might eaſely wyeld
               One yeare vndid what wee in ten had don:
               For enuy at home, and treaſon abroade, did yelde
               Kinge Charles his realme of Fraunce, made barrain field:
               For bloudy warres had waſted all encreaſe,
               VVhich cauſde the Pope helpe pouerty ſue for peace.
            
            
               So that in Tourayn, at the towne of Toures
               Duke Charles, and other for their Prince appered,
               So did Lord Roſſe, and I than Earle, for oures:
               And whan we ſhewed wherein ech other dered,
               VVe ſought out meanes al Quarels to haue clered,
               VVherein the Lordes of Germany, of Spayne,
               Of Hungary, and Denmarke, tooke exceedinge payne.
            
            
               But ſith wee coulde no finall peace induce,
               For neyther would the others couenaūtes here,
               For Eighteene monethes wee did conclude a truce:
               And while as frendes wee lay together there,
               Becauſe my Warrant did mee therein beare,
               To make a perfite peace, and through accord,
               I ſought a mariage for my Soueraygne Lord.
            
            
               
               And for the French Kinges Daughters were to ſmall,
               A fancied moſt Dame Margaret his Niece,
               A louely Lady, Bewtifull, and Tall,
               Faire ſpoken, pleaſaunt, a very Princely piece,
               In Wit, and learninge, matchleſſe hence to Greece,
               Duke Rayners Daughter of Antow, Kinge by ſtile
               Of Naples, Ieruſalem, and of Scycill Ile.
            
            
               But ere I could the graunt of her attayne:
               All that our Kinge had of her fathers landes,
               As Mountes the City, the county whole of Mayne,
               And moſt of A
                     •
                  iow Duc
                     •
                  y in our handes,
               I did releaſe him by aſſured handes.
               And as for Dowry with her none I ſought,
               I thought no peace could be to derely bought.
            
            
               But whan this mariage throughly was agreed
               Although my kinge were glad of ſutch a make
               His Vncle Humfrey abhorred it in deede,
               Becauſe thereby his precontract he brake,
               Made with the heyre of the Earle of Arminacke,
               A noble Mayde with ſtore of goods endowed,
               VVhich more than this with loſſe, the Duke allowed.
            
            
               But loue, and bewty in the kinge ſo wrought,
               That neither profit, or promiſe hee regarded,
               But ſet his vncles counſayle ſtill at nought:
               And for my gaynes, I highly was awarded.
               Thus vertue ſtarues, but luſt foode muſt bee larded,
               For I made Marquiſe, went to Fraunce agayne,
               And brought this Bryde vnto my Soueraygne.
            
            
               
               At whom becauſe Duke Humfrey ay repined.
               Calling their mariage aduoutrie (as it was)
               The Queene did moue me, erſt thereto enclyned,
               To helpe to bring him to his Requiem maſſe,
               Which ſith it could for no crime come to paſſe:
               His lyfe and doinges were ſo right and cleare,
               Through priuy murther we brought him to his Beere.
            
            
               Thus righteouſneſſe brought Humfrey to rebuke,
               Becauſe he ſhould no wickedneſſe allow,
               But for my doinges I was made a Duke.
               So Fortune can both bend and ſmoth her brow
               On whom ſhe liſt, not paſſing why or how.
               O Lord how high, how ſoone ſhe did me rayſe,
               How faſt ſhe fildime both with prayes and prayſe.
            
            
               The Lordes and Commons both of like aſſent,
               Be ſought my ſoueraigne kneeling on their knees,
               To recorde my doinges in the Parliament,
               As deedes deſeruing euerlaſting fees,
               In which attempt they did no labour leeſe,
               For they ſet not my prayſe ſo faſt in flame,
               As hee was redy to reward the ſame.
            
            
               But note the end, my deedes ſo worthy deemed
               Of King, of Lordes, and Commons altogether,
               Were ſhortlye after treaſons falſe eſteemed,
               And all men curſt Queene Margets comming hyther,
               For Charles the French king in his feaces not lither,
               Whan we had rendered Rayner, Maunts, and Mayne,
               Found meanes to wynne al Normandy againe.
            
            
               
               This made the Peopie curſe the mariage,
               Eſteeming it the cauſe of euery loſſe:
               Wherfore at mee with open mouth they rage,
               Affirming me to haue brought the realme to moſſe
                     •
                  
               
               Whan King and Queene ſaw things thus go a croſſe
               To quiet al a Parliament they called,
               And cauſed mee in Priſon to be thralled.
            
            
               And ſhortlye after brought me foorth abroade,
               VVhich made the commons more than double wood
               And ſome with weapons would haue layd on loade,
               If their graund Captaine Blewberd in his moode,
               Had not in time with wiſedome bene withſtode:
               But though that he and more were executed,
               The people ſtil their worſt againſt me bruted.
            
            
               And ſo applied the Parliament with Bylles,
               Of haynous wronges and open trayterous crimes,
               The king and Queene were forſt againſt their willes
               Fro place to place to adiourne it diuers times.
               For Princes power is like the ſandy ſlymes,
               VVhich muſt perforce geeue place vnto the waue,
               Or ſue the windye ſourges when they raue.
            
            
               Their lyfe was not more deare to them than I,
               VVhich made them ſearch al ſhiftes to ſaue me ſtil,
               But aye my foes ſuch faultes did on me trye,
               That to preſerue me from a worſer ill,
               The king was fayue ful ſore againſt his wyl:
               For fyue yeares ſpace to ſend me in exile,
               In hope to haue reſtorde me in a while.
            
            
               
               But marke howe vengeaunce wayteth vpon vice,

               VVere, vnto me recountinge all my faultes,
               As murdringe of Duke Humfrey in his Bed,
               And how I, had brought all the Realme to naughtes,
               Cauſing the Kinge vnlawfully to wed,

               This was myne ende: which was by reaſon due
               To me, and ſutch as others deaths procure.
               Therefore be bold to write, for it is true,

               Of due reward at laſt ſhalbe moſt ſure,

               VVHan this was ſayd: euery man reioſed to

be iniurious to Princes, yet in this &amp; ſutch lyk

                ſhee
is moſt righteous: and only deſerueth the name of

a goddeſſe, whan ſhe prouideth meanes to puniſh &amp;
deſtroy tyrantes. And when we had a while conſidered
the driftes of the Kinge &amp; Queene to haue ſaued
this duke: &amp; yet they could not: It is worth ye
labour (ſayd one) to way the workes, &amp; iudgemēts
of God: which ſeinge they are knowen moſt euidently
by comparing contraries, I will touch the
ſtory of Iacke Cade in order next following.
            Whom Kinge Henry with all his puiſſaunce was
no more able for a while to deſtroy (yet was he hys
rebellious enemy) thā he was to preſerue the Duke
of Suffolke his dereſt frend: by which two examples
doth appeare how notably God diſpoſeth all
thinges, and that no force ſtretcheth father, than
it pleaſeth him to ſuffer. For this Cade beinge an
Iriſheman, but of meane parentage, of no ability, &amp;
leſſe power, accompanied with a fewe naked Kentiſh
mē, cauſed the king with his army at al points
appointed, to leaue the fielde, and ſuffer him to doe
whatſoeuer he luſted for a tyme, but in the ende he
was ſlaine at Hothfield in Suffer, and caried thēce
to London in a Cart, &amp; there quartered. In whoſe
behalfe, ſeeinge hee is one of Fortunes Whelpes, I
will trouble you a while to heare the proceſſe
of his enterpriſe, which hee may declare
in maner followinge.

                  SHall I call it Fortune or my frowardfolly,
               That lifte mee vp, and layd mee downe belowe?
               Or was it Courage, that made me ſo Ioly.
               Or ſtrēgth of ſtars, wt make men high to growe?
               What euer it were this one poynct ſuer I know,

               It may be well that planets do encline,
               And our complexions moue our mindes to ill,
               But ſutch is reaſon, that they bringe to fine
               No worke vnayded of our luſt, and will:
               For Heauen, and Earth are ſubiect both to ſkill.

               To worke our wo, or leaue the proper kynde.
            
            
               
               But though this ſkill bee geuen to euery man

               Than is ſhe iuſtly called falſe, and blinde,

               VVhich to the World their wretched willes diſpoſe.
            
            
               Amonge which Fooles (marke Baldwyn) I am one,
               That would not ſtay my ſelfe in mine eſtate.
               I thought to rule, but would obay to none,
               Wherefore I thought to be my Princes mate,
               And by ſome meane his power to abate,
               And for that ends, Mortimer would be nam'de,

               This ſhift I vſed the people to perſwade
               To leaue their Prince, and on my ſyde to ſticke.
               Whereas in deede, my fathers name was Cade.
               Whoſe noble ſtocke was neuer worth a ſticke.
               But touching wit I was both rype and quicke.
               Had ſtrength of Luns, large ſtature, comely face,
               Which made men wene my lignage were not baſe.

               Aſſailed vs at Senocke where we laye:
               From whence aliue they parted not awaye,
               Which w
                     •
                  an the kinges retinue vnderſtoode,
               They all affirmde my quarel to be good.
            
            
               
               Which cauſed the King and Queene whom all did hate,
               To rayſe their Campe, and ſodenly depart:
               And that they might the Peoples grudge abate,
               To impriſon ſome ful ſore againſt their hart.
               Lord Saye was one, whom I made after ſmart,
               For after Staffordes and their hoaſt was ſlayne,
               To Blackheath field I marched backe agayne.
            
            
               And where the King would nothing heare before,
               Now was he glad to ſend to know my minde:
               And I thereby enflamed much the more,
               Refuſed his grauntes ſo folly made me blynde.
               For this be flew, and left Lord Scales behinde,
               To helpe the towne and ſtrengthen London tower,
               Towardes which I marched forward with my power.
            
            
               And found there al thinges at myne owne deſire.
               I entred London did there what I liſt,
               The Treaſorer, Lord Saye, I did conſpyre
               To haue condempned: whereof whan I miſt,
               (For hee by law my malice did reſiſt)
               By force I tooke him i
                     •
                   Guildhal fro the heape,
               And headed him before the Croſſe in Cheape.
            
            
               His Sonne in lawe Iames Cromer ſhriue of Kent
               I caught at Myle end, whereas then he laye:
               Beheaded him and on a poale I ſent,
               His head to London where his fathers laye.
               With theſe two heades I made a prety play,
               For pight on poales I bore them through the ſtreete,
               And for my ſport made ech kiſſe other ſweete.
            
            
               
               Than brake I Priſons ſet forth whom I would,
               And vſed the city as it had bin myne:
               Tooke from the Marchauntes, money, ware, and gold.
               From ſome by force, from other ſome by ſyne.
               This at the length did cauſe them to repyne,
               So that Lord Scal
                     •
                  s, conſentinge with the Mayre,
               Forbad vs to their City to repayre.
            
            
               For all this while mine hoaſt in Southwarke lay,
               VVho whan they knew out paſſage was denied,
               Came boldely to the bridge and made a fray.
               For in wee would the townes men vs defied:
               But whan with ſtrokes wee had the matter tried,
               VVee wan the Bridge and ſet mutch part on ſier,
               This dane to Southwarke bock we did retier.
            
            
               The morow after came the Chancellour,
               VVith generall pardon for my men, halfe gone,
               VVhich heard and read, the reſt within an houre,
               Shranke all away ech man to ſhift for one.
               And whan I ſawe they left mee poſt alone,
               I did diſguiſe me like a knight of the poſt,
               And into Suſſex rode away in poſte.
            
            
               And there I lurked till that curſed coyne,
               That reſtleſſe Begle ſought, and found mee out,
               For ſtraight the Kinge by promiſe did emoyne,
               A thouſand marke to whoſoeuer mought
               Apprehend my corſe, which made them ſeeke about:
               Amonge the which one Alexander Iden,
               Found out the Hole wherein the Foxe was hidden.
            
            
               
               But ere hee tooke me, I put him to his Trumps,
               For yeeld I would not while my handes would holde,
               But hope of money made him ſtur his ſtumps,
               And to aſſault mee valiauntly, and bolde.
               For two longe Howres, our Combat was not colde
               Till at the laſt he lent me ſutch a ſtroke,
               That down I fell, and neuer after ſpoke.
            
            
               Than was my Carkaſſe caried like a Hog.
               To Southwarkes Borough where it lay a night,
               The next day drawen to Newgate like a dog,
               All men reioyſinge at the rufull ſight:
               Than were on Poales my perboyls Quarters pight,
               And ſet a loft for Vermin to deuour,
               Meete graue for Rebels that reſiſt the power.
            
            
               Full litle knowe wee Wretches what wee do,
               VVhen wee preſume our Princes to reſiſt.
               VVee Warre with God, againſt his glory to,
               That placeth in his office whom hee liſt:
               Therefore was neuer Traytour yet, but miſt
               The Marke hee ſhot, and came to ſhamefull ende,
               Nor neuer ſhall tyll God bee forſt to bende.
            
            
               God hath ordayne the power, all Princes bee
               Hys Lieutenantes, nor deputies in realmes,
               Agaynſt their Foes therefore fighteth hee,
               And his Enemies driues them to extreames,
               Their wyſe deuiſes, proue but Doltiſh dreames.
               No Subiect ought for any kinde of cauſe,
               To force the Prince. but yelde him to the lawes.
            
            
               
               Wherfore Baldwin warne men to folow reaſon.
               Subdue their wylles and be not Fortunes ſlaues,
               A ſhameful end doth euer follow treaſon,
               There is no truſt in Rebels, raſcall knaues,
               In Fortune leſſe, which worketh as the waues:
               From whoſe aſſaultes who liſteth to ſtand free,
               Muſt know his ſtate, and ſo contented bee.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
               BY ſaint Mary (ſaid one) if Iacke were
as wel learned, as you haue made hys
oration, whatſoeuer hee was by byrth,
I warrante him a Gentilman by his
learning. How notablye &amp; philoſopher
like hath he deſcribed fortune, &amp; the cauſes of worldlye
cumbraunce? how lyke a diuine hath he determined
the office both of Magiſtrates and ſubiects
For in deede Magiſtrates be Gods deputies, and it
is Gods office which they beare: and it is hee whiche
ordeyneth thereto ſuch as himſelfe liſteth, good
whan he fauoureth the People, and euil when hee
wyl puniſh them. And therfore whoſoeuer rebelleth
againſt any ruler, eyther good or bad, rebelleth agaynſt
God, and ſhal neuer ſee good end of hys attempt:
for God cannot but mainteyn his deputie.
Yet this I note by the way concerning rebelles &amp;
rebellions. Although the deuil rayſe them, yet God
alwayes vſeth them to his glorye, as a part of hys
iuſtice. For whan kinges &amp; chiefe rulers, ſuffer their

vnder officers to miſuſe their ſubiects, and wil not
heare nor remedy their peoples wrongs (whā they
complayne) then ſuffereth God the Rebell to rage,
and to execute that parte of his Iuſtice, which the
parcial prince would not.
            For the Lord Saye a very corrupt officer, and one
whome notwithſtanding the kinge always maynteyned.
was deſtroyed by this Iacke, as was alſo
the Biſhop of Saliſburye (a proud and couetous
Prelate) by other of the Rebelles. And therefore
whatſoeuer prince deſireth to lyue quietly without
rebellion muſt doe his ſubiectes right in al thinges
and puniſh ſuche Officers as oppreſſe, his People:
thus ſhal they be ſure from all Rebellion. And for ye
clerer opening hereof, it were wel done to ſet forth
this Lord Sayes tragedye. What neede that (ſaid
another) ſeeing ye like example is ſeene in the Duke
of Suffolke, whoſe doings are declared ſufficientlye
alreadye. Nay let vs goe forward for we haue
a great many behinde that may not be omitted, &amp;
the tyme as you ſee paſſeth away. As for this lord
Saye, whome Cade ſo cruellye killed, and ſpitefullye
vſed after his Death (I dare ſaye) ſhalbee
knowen thereby he was to all that reade or
heare this ſtorye. For God would neuer haue ſuffered
hym to haue beene ſo vſed, except he had firſt
deſerued it.
            
               
Therefore let him go and wyth him the Biſhop, and
all other ſlayne in that rebellion which was rayſed
by ſome ſly drift of the Duke of Yorke, who ſhortly
after by opē War, manifeſted his title to ye crowne,
and therefore gathered an army in Wales, &amp; marched
towardes London: And preuentinge ye kinge,
goinge northward to prepare an army, in the waye
at Sayncte Albanes: Who for want of a ſufficient
power to take the field, was forced with ſutch ſmal
power as he had about him, to defend the Lanes, &amp;
backſydes of the towne, and to ſend out the Duke
of Buckingham for a treaty, which the Duke of
Yorke beinge head of the contrary faction, woulde
not allow without fyrſt hauinge the Duke of Somerſet
and other at his will, duringe which treaty
Richard Neuill Earle of Warwike, the ſtout maintayner
of yorckes title entred the Towne by force,
fought a Battayle in the high ſtreat, where of the
Kinges part were ſlayne the ſayd Duke of Somerſet
called Edmond Beauford, Henry Percy the ſecond
of that ſurname, Earle of Northumberlande,
Humfrey, Earle of Stafford, Sonne and Heyre to
Humfrey Duke of Buckingham, Ihon Lord Clifford,
Babthorp the Kinges attorney, and his Son
and heyre, beſides a great number of Knightes, Eſquiers,
Gentlemen, &amp; yeomen of ye kinges houſhold &amp;
of other Lordes ſeruauntes, on whō al the ſlaughter,

and bochery fell, beinge all for the more part vnarmed.
But becauſe the Duke of Somerſet
was the chiefe of the Kinges parte paſſinge
ouer the reſt, let vs only
heare him ſpeake
for all.

                  SOme I ſuppoſe are borne vnfortunate,
               Els good endeuours coulde not ſo ill ſucceede,
               VVhat ſhall I call it? ill fortune or fate,
               That ſome attempts haue neuer happy ſpeede,
               But trauayle thankleſſe, al bootleſſe their heede:
               VVhere other vnlike in workinge, or in ſkill,
               Wynne what they will, and wield the world at will.
            
            
               Of the firſt ſorte, myſelfe I count for one,
               To all miſhap, I we

                  ne predeſtinate,
               Beleeue mee Baldwin, there bee few or none,
               To whom Fortune was euer more ingrate.
               Make thou therefore my life a Caueat,
               That who ſo with force wyll worke agaynſt kinde,
               Sayleth (as who ſayth) agaynſt the ſtremt, and winde.
            
            
               For I of Somerſet which Duke Edmond hight,
               Extract by diſcent from Lancaſter lyne,
               VVere it by folly, or Fortunes deſpight,
               Or by ill aſpect of ſome croked ſigne,
               Of myne attempts could neuer ſee good fine:
               VVhat ſo I began did ſeldome well ende:
               God from ſutch Fortune, all good men defend.
            
            
               
               Where I ſought to ſaue, moſt part I did ſpill,
               For good hap with mee was alway at Warre.
               The Linage of Yorke whom I bare ſo ill,
               By my ſpight became bright, and ſhone like a Starre,
               Thus ſome whiles men make, when fayne they would marre.
               The more yee lop Trees, the greater they grow.
               The more yee ſtop Streames, the higher they flow.
            
            
               Maugre my ſpighte, his glory grew the more,
               And mine, as the Moone in the wane, waxt leſte
               For hauinge the place which he had before,
               Gouernour of Fraunce, needes I muſt confeſſe,
               That loſt was Normandy yet netheleſſe,
               Alwayes I wrought that wit might well contriue,
               But what bootes it, againſt the Streame to ſtriue?
            
            
               Borne was I neyther to Warre ne to peace,
               
                  Mars was maligne, and enemy to my trade:
               My Birth I beleue was in Ioues decreaſe,
               When Cancer in courſe, beinge retrograde,
               Swarued from Sol, vnto Saturnus ſhade,
               Where aſpectes were good, oppoſites did marre,
               So grew mine vnhap both in peace, and warre.
            
            
               A ſtraunge Natiuity in calculation,
               As my liues courſe, did after well declare,
               Wherof in briefe to make relation,
               That other by mee may learne to beware,
               Ouerlight credence was cauſe of my care.
               And want of foreſight in geuinge aſſent,
               Humfrey to damme that Duke moſt innocent.
            
            
               
               Humfrey meane I that was the protectour,
               Duke of Gloceſter of the royall bloud,
               So long as he was Englandes directour,
               Kinge Henries title to the Crowne was good,
               This worthy Prince, as a Piller longe ſtoad:
               Or like a ſtrong prop ſet vnder a vyne,
               In ſtate to vpholde all Lancaſters lyne.
            
            
               O headleſſe truſt, vnware of harme to come,
               O mad malice where wit obeyeth will,
               VVas there euer any, whom folly did ſo nome:

               So long as he in England bare the ſway,
               So long Rebelles no Quarelles durſt begin,
               But when the poſte, was pulled once away,
               Which ſtoode to vpholde the kinge, and his kin,
               The Duke of Yorke, than ſtoutly hee ſtept in,
               And chalenged the Crowne, by color of right,
               Beginninge with Lawe, and endinge with might.
            
            
               And ſpred great brutes in England vp and downe,
               That he of England was the heire true,
               And how Henry had vſurped the Crowne
               Againſt all right, by practiſe moſt vntrue:
               The people than, embraſinge titles newe,
               Irkeſome of preſent, and longing for chaunge,
               Aſſenced ſoone, becauſe they loue to raunge.
            
            
               
               True is the text which wee in Scripture reade,
               Vae terrae illi cuius rex eſt puer.
               Wo to that land whereof a child is head,
               Whether childe or childiſhe, the caſe is one ſure,
               Where Kinges be younge, we dayly ſee in bre,
               The people awleſſe, by weakneſſe of their head,
               Leade their liues lawleſſe, hauinge none to dread.
            
            
               And no leſſe true is this text agayne,
               Beata terra cuius rex eſt nobilis.
               Bleſt is the Land, where a ſtout Kinge doth rayne.
               Wherein good peace ech man poſſeſſeth his,
               For dread of whom, no man dare do amis,
               Whoſe Prince is preſt alwayes, and Sword in hand,
               At home and abroade, all enemies to withſtand.
            
            
               In caſe the ſonne had proued ſutch a one,
               Hardy and ſtoute as his fathers afore,
               Sure had he ſitten in the Royall throne,
               Dreadleſſe, and careleſſe of common vpror.
               But Henries weakeneſſe appeered more, and more,
               Which boldneſſe gaue, to the contrary band,
               To ſpoyle him at laſt both of life, and land.
            
            
               His humble heart was nothinge vnknowen,
               To the gaye gallants, of Yorkes retinue,
               Any lowe ground, is highly ouerflowen,
               And ſhored houſes cannot long continue,
               Ioyntes cannot knit whereas is no Synowe.
               And ſo a Prince, not dread aſwell as loued,
               By hold Traytours may bee ſoone remoued.
            
            
               
               Well mought I ſee, had I not wanted brayne,
               The worke begon to vndermine the ſtate,
               When the chiefe link was looſed fro the chayne,
               And that ſome durſt vpon bloud royall grate,
               How tickle hold I had of myne eſtate?
               When the chiefe poſt lay flat vppon the flore,
               Mought not I thinke my ſtaffe then next the dore?
            
            
               So mought alſo, dame Margaret the Queene,
               By whoſe malice this miſchife firſt began,
               Did ſhe (trow yee) her ſelfe not ouerwene
               Death to procure to that moſt worthy man?
               Which ſhe and hers afterward mought well ban,
               On whom did hange, as I before haue ſayde,
               Her Huſbandes life, his honour and his ayde.
            
            
               For whilſt he liued which was one ſtable ſtay,
               Yorke and his Impes were kept as vnder Yoke,
               But when the Piller remoued was away,
               Then durſt out flame, that late before was Smoke,
               The cloſe Traytoure, then caſt of his Cloake,
               And from the dark came forth in open light,
               VVith titles blinde which he ſet forth for right.
            
            
               But this to achieue, firſt it him behoued,
               The Kinge and his kin a ſunder for to ſet:
               Who once perforce, or practice ill remoued,
               Then had they auoyded the principall le,
               VVhith kept the ſought pray ſo longe from the Net:
               The next poynct after, was themſelues to place
               Next to the Prince, and other to abaſe.
            
            
               
               I was the firſt whom they put out of place,
               No cauſe pretendinge, but the common weale,
               The crowne on England was the very caſe,
               VVhy to the Commons they burned ſo in zeale,
               My faultes were Cloakes their practiſe to conceale,
               In counſayle hearinge conſider the entent,
               For by pretence of truth, treaſon oft is ment.
            
            
               So their pretence was onely to remoue,
               Counſayle corrupt from place about the Kinge,
               But O yee Princes, you it doth behoue,
               This caſe to conſtrue, as no fayned thinge,
               That neuer traytour did ſubdue his kinge,
               But for his plat▪ ere he would further wade,
               Agaynſt his frendes, the Quarel firſt hee made.
            
            
               And if hap he could ſo bringe about,
               Them to ſubdue, and haue them at his will,
               Then would he waxe ſo arrogant, and ſtout,
               That no reaſon, his outrage might fulfill,
               But to proceede vppon his purpoſe ſtill,
               Till Kinge, and Counſayle brought were in one caſe:
               Sutch is their folly, to rebels that geue place.
            
            
               So for the fiſhe, when caſt forth was the Net,
               The next poynct was in driuinge out the plat,
               Commons to cauſe, in rage to fume, and fret,
               And to rebell, I cannot tell for what,
               Requiringe redreſſe of this, and of that:
               Who if they ſpeede, the ſtander at receit,
               Graſp will the Pray, for which he doth awayt.
            
            
               
               Then by ſurmiſe of ſome thinge pretended,
               Sutch to diſplace as they may well ſuſpect,
               Like to withſtand their miſchiefe entended,
               And in their roumes their banders to elect,
               The aduerſe party proudly to reiect
               And then with reportes the ſimple to abuſe,
               And when theſe helpes fayle, open force to vſe.
            
            
               So this Dukes traynes were couert, and not ſeene.
               Who little ment, that which hee moſt pretended,
               Like to a Serpent lurkinge vnder greene,
               To the weale publike ſeemed wholly vended:
               Zelous he was, and would haue all thinges mended,
               But by that mendment nothinge els he ment,
               But to be Kinge, to that marke was his bent.
            
            
               For had be bin playne, as hee ment in deede,
               Henry to depoſe from the royall place,
               His haſt had bin waſte, and murch worſe his ſpeede,
               The Kinge then ſtandinge in his peoples grace,
               This Duke therefore ſetforth a goodly face,
               As one that ment no quarrel for the Crowne,
               Sutch as bare rule, he onely would put downe.
            
            
               But all for nought, ſo longe as I bare ſtroke,
               Serued theſe driftes, and proued all but vayne,
               The beſt helpe then, was people to prouoke,
               To make Commotion, and Vprores a mayne:
               Which to appeaſe, the Kinge himſelfe was fayne,
               From blacke Heath in Kent, to ſend me to the Tower,
               Sutch was the ſorce of Rebelles in that Hower.
            
            
               
               The tempeſt yet therewith was not ceaſſed,
               For Yorke was bent his purpoſe to purſue,
               Who ſeeinge how ſoone I was releaſſed,
               And ill ſucceſſe of ſufferaunce to enſue:
               Then like Iudas, vnto his Lord vntrue,
               Thynkinge time loſt any lenger to defarre,
               By Warwickes ayde proclaymed open warre.
            
            
               S. Albanes towne, where both our Hoaſtes did meete,
               To crye a fielde was not an equall place,
               For we were forſt to fight within a ſtreete,
               With fewe agaynſt many, ſutch was the caſe,
               There I and Warwicke fronted face to face,
               At an Inne doore, the Caſtell was the ſigne,
               Where with a Sworde was cut my fatall lyne.
            
            
               Oft was I warned to come in Caſtle none,
               But little thought of any Common ſigne,
               I did Imagine a Caſtell built with ſtone,
               For of no Iune, I could the ſame deuine,
               In Prophetes ſkill my wits were neuer fine,
               A foole is hee that ſutch vayne dreames doth dred,
               But more Foole hee, that will by them beiled.
            
            
               My life I loſt in that vnlucky place,
               VVith many Lordes that leaned to my part,
               The Earle Percy had no better grace,
               Couragious Clifford could not eſchewe the dart,
               Buckinghams Heyre was at this mortall mart,
               Babthorp the Attorney for all his ſkill in Lawe,
               In this poynct of pleadinge appeared very rawe.
            
            
               
               So thus poore Prince diſarmed of his bandes,
               His frendes all ſlayne, wantinge good aſſiſtence,
               VVas made a Pray vnto his enemies handes,
               Priued of power and Princely reuerence,
               And as a Pupill boyde of all experience,
               Innocent playne, and ſimple witted,
               Was as a Lambe vnto the Wolfe committed.
            
            
               A Parliament than was called with ſpeede,
               A Parliament, nay a playne conſpiracy,
               VVhen agaynſt right it was decreed,
               That after the death of the ſixt Henry,
               The Duke of Yorke ſhould haue the regally,
               And in his life, the charge, and protection,
               Of Kinge and Realme at the Dukes direction.
            
            
               And thus was Yorke declared Protectour,
               Protectour ſayd I, nay Proditor playne.
               A rancke Rebell the Princes directour,
               A vaſſall to leade his Lord, and Souerayne,
               VVhat honeſt hart would not conceiue diſdayne,
               To ſee the foote ſurmount aboue the head,
               A Monſter is in ſpight of nature bred.
            
            
               Some haply heere, will moue a farther dout,
               And for Yorkes part alledge an elder right,
               O braynleſſe head, that ſo runne in and out,
               VVhan length of time a ſtate hath firmely pight,
               And good accord hath putall ſtrife to flight,
               VVere it not better ſutch titles ſtil to ſleepe,
               Than all a Realme, about the tryall weepe?
            
            
               
               From the female, came Yorke, and all his leede,
               And wee Lancaſtrians, from the Heyre Male,
               Of whom thre Kinges in order did ſucceede,
               By iuſt diſcent: this is no fayned tale.
               Who would haue thought that any ſtorme or gale
               Our ſhip could ſhake hauinge ſutch Anker hold,
               None I thincke ſure, vnleſſe that God ſo would.
            
            
               After this burle the Kinge was fayne to flee,
               Northward in poſt, for ſuccour, and releefe,
               O bleſſed God how ſtraunge it was to ſee!
               A rightfull Prince purſued as a Theefe!
               To thee O England, what can be more repreefe?
               Then to purſue thy Prince with armed hand,
               VVhat greater ſhame, may bee to any Land?
            
            
               Traytours did triumph, true men lay in the duſt,
               Reuiage, and Robbiage, toyſted euery where,
               VVill, ſtoode for ſkill, and Law obeyed luſt,
               Might, trode downe right, of Kinge there was no feare,
               The title was tryed onely by Shield, and Speare:
               All which vnhaps, that they were not foreſeene,
               Suffolke was in fault, who ruled Kinge. and Queene.
            
            
               Some here perhaps, do looke I ſhould accuſe
               My ſelfe of ſleight, or ſubtilty vniuſt,
               VVherein I ſhould my Princes Eares abuſe
               Agaynſt the Duke, to bringe him in myſtruſt,
               Some part whereof, though needes confeſſe I muſt,
               My fault onely, conſiſted in conſent
               To my Foes driftes, which I could not preuent.
            
            
               
               If I at firſt whan Brandes began to ſmoke,
               The Sparkes to quench by any way had ſought,
               Neuer had England felt this mortall ſtroke,
               Which now to late lamentinge helpeth nought
               Two poynctes of Wit to dearely haue I bought,
               The firſt that better is timely to foreſee,
               Then after ouer late, a Counſaylour to bee.
            
            
               The ſecond is, not eaſely to aſſent,
               To any aduice, agaynſt thy faythfull frend,
               But of the Speaker ponder the intent,
               The meaninge ful, the poinct, and finall ende:
               A Sainct in ſhowe, in proofe is found a Fende,
               The ſubtile man, the ſimple to abuſe,
               Mutch pleaſaunt Speach, and Eloquence doth vſe.
            
            
               And ſo was I, and other mo abuſed
               By Suffolkes ſleights, who ſought to pleaſe the Queene,
               Forecaſt we lackt, which cannot be excuſed
               Of thinges to come, as ſoone was after ſeene:
               Which gloſinge tongue, he made vs fooles to weene,
               That Humfrey did to Englandes crowne aſpyre,
               Which to preuent his death they did conſpyre.
            
            
               What ſhould I more of mine vnhaps declare,
               Whereof my death at laſt hath ma

                  e an ende?
               Not I alone was cauſe of all this care,
               Some beſydes mee there were that did offende.
               None I accuſe, nor yet my ſelfe defend,
               Faultes I confeſſe, as no man liues without,
               My chiefe fault, was folly, out of dout.
            
            
               
               Folly was chiefe, the noughty tyme was next,
               VVhich made my Fortune ſubiect to the chiefe:
               If England then with ſtrife had not bin vext.
               Glory might haue growen whereas enſued griefe,
               Yet one thinge is, my comfort, and reliefe,
               Conſtant I was in my Princes Quarell,
               To dye or lyue, and ſpared for no parel.
            
            
               What though Fortune enuious was my foe,
               A noble hart ought not the ſoner yeild,
               Nor ſhrincke a backe for any weale or woe,
               But for his Prince ly bleeding in the field:
               If priuy ſpight at any time mee belde,
               The price is payde: and greeuous is my guerdon,
               As for the reſt God (I truſt) will pardon.
            
            FINIS.

               AFter this Tragedy ended, one ſayd ſeeinge
this Duke hath ſo vehemently exclaymed
agaynſt the Duke of Yorkes practiſes, it
were well done to heare what hee can ſay for himſelfe.
For after ye firſt battayle at S. Albanes when

day of Iuly in yt yeare of grace. 1460. ſought with
them, loſt the field, and was taken himſelfe, and many
of his freendes ſlayne, as Humfrey Stafforde
Duke of Buckingham, Ihon Talbot the ſecond of
that name Earle of Shreweſbury, Ihon Vicounte
Beaumont, Thomas Lord Egremont, Syr William
Lucy, and diuers other. But ouerpaſſinge all
theſe and many mo becauſe they were honourably
ſlayne in the field, let vs come to him who was the
chiefe cauſe thereof, that is to ſay, Richard Plantagenet
Duke of York ſlayne in the battel at Wakefield
on Chriſtmas euē, and Edmond Earle of Ruflande
his yong ſonne, who was there murthered by
the Lorde Clifforde as he woulde haue fled into the
towne to haue ſaued himſelfe.
            Therefore imagine that you ſee a tall mans body
full of freſh woundes but lacking a head, holdinge
by the hande a goodly childe, whoſe breaſt was ſo
wounded that his heart might bee ſeene, hys louely
face and eyes diſfigured with droppinge teares, his
Hayre through horor ſtandinge vpright, his mercy
crauinge handes, al to be mangled, and all his
body embrued with his owne blould, out
of the Weſand pipe of which headles
body came a ſhreking voyce ſayinge
as followeth.
         
         
            
            HOW RICHARD PLANtagenet
Duke of Yorke was ſlayne
through his ouer raſh boldneſſe, and his Sonne Earle
of Rutland an Infant cruelly murdered
Anno. 1460.
            
               
                  TRuſt Fortune (quoth he) in whom was neuer truſt,
               O Beaſtes moſt brute, that haue no better grace,
               All reſt, renowne, and deedes lye in the duſt,
               Of all the ſort that ſue her ſlipper trace,
               How now? Why doſt thou Baldwin hide thy face?
               Thou needeſt not feare, although Imiſſe my head,
               See this poore Boy, whom by the hand I lead.
            
            
               The cauſe why I thus lead him in my hand,
               With bloud, and teares halinge his body ſtaynd,
               Is that thou mayeſt the better vnderſtand,
               How hardly Fortune hath for vs ordaynde
               In whom her loue and hate be whole contaynde.
               Rychard I am Plantagenet by name,
               Whilom of Yorke the Duke of worthy fame.
            
            
               For Richard Earle of Cambridge, eldeſt ſonne
               Of Duke Edmond, thirde ſonne of King Edward,
               Engendred me whereof the courſe did runne,
               Of Mortimers to be the Iſſue gard:
               For when Edmond ber brother dyed Warde,
               She was ſole heyre by due diſcent of line,
               VVhereby her Rightes, and Titles all were mine.
            
            
               
               But marke me now I pray the Baldwin marke,
               And ſee how force oft ouerbeareth right,
               Way how vſurpers tyrannouſly warke,
               To keepe by murther that they get by might,
               And note what troubles and daungers do alight,
               On ſuch as ſeeke to repoſſeſſe their owne,
               And how by might, oft right is ouerthrowne.
            
            
               Duke Henry of Hereforde called Bolenbrooke.
               Of whom Duke Mowbray told the now of late,
               Whan traytour like he had king Richard tooke:
               Kild him in priſon, vſurped his eſtate,
               Without al right, or title, ſauing hate
               Of others rule, or loue to rule alone,
               Theſe two excepted tytle had hee none.
            
            
               The Crowne by right came to Edmond Mortimer
               Whoſe Father Roger was king Richardes heire,
               Which cauſed Henry, and them of Lancaſter,
               To ſeeke all ſhiftes our houſes to appayre,
               For ſure he was to ſit beſide the chayre,
               Were wee of power to clayme our lawful right,
               And therfore thought good, to extirpe vs quight.
            
            
               His curſed ſonne enſued the fathers trade,
               And kept my coſin guiltleſſe in ſure hold,
               For whom my father ful often did perſwade,
               With his allies and conſins that they would.
               Their Kinſmans right mainteyn and vphold.
               And to depoſe by pollicy or power.
               The heyre of him that was an vſurper.
            
            
               
               Whereof when Henry of that name the fift,
               Had heard, and knew of this conſpiracye,
               He from ſir Edmond al the blame to ſhift,
               Sayd that my Father was the French kings aly,
               And hyred by him to worke this trecherye,
               For which at Hampton as it came to paſſe,
               His lyfe he loſt, and there veheaded was.
            
            
               Thus was the name of Mortimer extinct,
               Whoſe right and title deſcended vnto me,
               Being forſt to lyue, within a precinct
               For feare I would to other countries flee
               And ſo beeing at myne owne libertee,
               Might haplye moue ſedicion or ſtrife,
               For guilty hartes, can leade no quiet lyfe.
            
            
               Yet at the laſt in Henries dayes the ſixt,
               I was reſtored to my fathers landes,
               Made duke of Yorke: where through my mind I fixt,
               To get the Crowne and kingdome in my handes,
               For ayde wherein I knit aſſured bandes
               With Neuils ſtocke, whoſe daughter was my make
               Whereby great frendes I had my part to take.
            
            
               O Lord what hap had I by mariage,
               Fowre fayre Sonnes my yong wife to me bore,
               Valiaunt men and prudent for their age,
               Such brothers ſhe had and nephewes ſtil in ſtore
               As none of the kin had any time before:
               The Earle of Saliſburie, &amp; his ſonne of Warwicke,
               Were knights peereleſſe, frō Barbary to Barwick.
            
            
               
               Through helpe of whom, &amp; Fortunes frendly grace,
               I firſt began to claime my lawful right,
               And my chiefe foes with ſtoutneſſe to deface.
               I rayſed power at al pointes preſt to fight:
               Of whom the chiefe that chiefly bare me ſpight,
               Was Somerſet the Duke, whom to annoy
               Al my hole force, I dayly did employ.
            
            
               And maugre him ſo choyſe lo was my chaunce,
               Yea though the Queene was wholy on hys ſyde,
               I twiſe vare rule in Normandy and Fraunce,
               And laſt lieutenant in Ireland I did byde,
               Ful often driuen of force my head to hyde,
               Yet through the loue, my doinges there did breede,
               I had their helpe at al times in my neede.
            
            
               This doutye Duke moſt deare to King and Queene,
               With armed hoaſte, I thriſe met in the field,
               The firſt vnfought through treaty made betweene,
               The ſecond ioynde wherein the King did yelde,
               The Duke was ſlayne, the Queene her partie helde
               Farre in the North, where ouermatcht with power
               My life I loſt, in an vnlucky howre.
            
            
               Before this laſt were other battailes three,
               The firſt the Earle of Saliſburie alone,
               Fought on Bloreheath, and got the victorie,
               I at the next was preſent in perſone
               With my chiefe kin, whereas by one and one,
               Our ſouldiers falſe, withdrew away by night,
               Vnto our foes and wee put all to flight.
            
            
               
               This Boy and I in Ireland did vs ſaue,
               Mine eldeſt ſonne with Warwicke and his father,
               To Calais got, whence by the read I gaue
               They came againe to London, and did gather,
               Another hoaſt, whereof I ſpake no rather:
               And met our foes ſlew many a Lord and knight,
               And tooke the King and draue the Queene to flight.
            
            
               This doue I came to England all in haſte,
               New claime to make vnto the realme and crowne,
               And in the houſe while Parliament did laſt,
               In the Kinges ſeate, I boldly ſate me downe,
               Clayming the place, whereat the Lordes did frown,
               But what for that, I did ſo wel proceede,
               That al at laſt to my demaund agreed.
            
            
               But ſith Henry had raigned than ſo long,
               They would be ſhould continue til he dyed.
               And to thend to make my title ſtrong,
               Apparant heire of England they me cryed,
               But ſith the Queene and others this denied,
               I ſped me ſtraight Northward whereas ſhe lay,
               Meaning by force to cauſe her to obay.
            
            
               She thereof warned, prepared a ſtrong power.
               And ere my men were altogether redye
               To Sandale came, where in a diſmal houre
               I like a Beaſt, ſo raſh was, and ſo heddy
               To trie Fortune, which alwaies is vnſteddy
               With thouſands fiue, of ſouldiers to aſſayle
               The double number, in campe to their auayle.
            
            
               
               And ſo was ſlayne at firſt: and whyle my pore infant
               Scarſe twelue yere olde, ſought way himſelfe to ſaue,
               That cruel Clifford that fel bloudy tyrant,
               While the pore chyld with tears did mercy craue,
               With dagger ſharp his hart a ſunder claue.
               This don he came to the campe where I lay dead,
               Diſpoyld my corps, and cut away my head.
            
            
               And ſet a crowne of paper theruppon
               Which for a ſport he ſent vnto the Quene
               And ſhe for ſpyte commaunded it anon.
               To be had to Yorke and ſet vp to be ſene.
               In ſome ſuch place as theuis &amp; Traitors bene,
               This mocke I had of fortune for rewarde,
               After long hope that ſhe wold me regard
            
            
               Wherfore Baldwin ſee that thou ſet her forth
               With her ſlipper pranks ſo as they may be known,
               And warne all princes wel to way the worth
               Of thinges, for which the ſide of war be ſowen
               The gaine no ſurer but as of dice throwen
               No worldly good can counterpeyze the pryſe
               Of halfe the paynes that may therof aryſe.
            
            
               Better it were to loſe a peece of right,
               Then limmes and life in wreſtling for the ſame,
               It is not force, of frendſhip nor of might,
               But god aboue that kingdomes ſet in frame
               Not wit, but chance doth weild the winners game,
               Wherfore if we our follies would refrayne,
               Tyme woulde redreſſe all wronges we voyde of payne.
            
            
               
               Wherfore warne Lordes no wiſe to wade in warre
               For any cauſe, ſaue their countries defence,
               Their troublous titles are vnworthy farre
               The bloud, the life, the ſpoile of innocence,
               Of ſcendes, of foes, behold my long expence,
               And neuer the neare: beſt than to tary time,
               Low by the ground, than ouer high to clyme.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
               WIth that maiſter Ferrers ſhoke me by the
ſleeue ſaying: why how now man do you
forget your ſelfe? belike you mynde oure
matters very much. So I do in deede (ſaid I) for
I dreame of them. And whan I had rehearſed my
dreame, we had long talke concerning the nature
of dreames, which to ſtint, and to bringe vs to oure
matter agayne, thus ſayde one of them: I am glad
it was your chaunce to dreame of Duke Richarde
for it had bene pitty to haue ouerpaſſed him.
            And as concerning this Lorde Clifforde which ſo
cruelly killed his ſonne, I purpoſe to geeue you notes:
Who (as he wel deſerued) came ſhortlye after
to a ſodaine death, and yet too good for a cruell tyraunt.
For on Palmeſonday next folowing, being
the 29. Daye of March, in the yeare of Chriſte, a
Thouſand foure hundreth threeſcore and one, this
Lord Clifford with Henry Percy the thirde Earle
of Northumberlande, the Earle of Weſtmerlande,

the Lorde Dacres, the Lorde Welles &amp; other were
ſlayne at Towton in Yorkeſhyre. Wherfore as
you thought you ſawe &amp; heard the headleſſe Duke
ſpeake thorowe his necke, ſo nowe ſuppoſe you ſee
this Lord Clifford al armed ſaue his head, with his
Breaſt plate all gore bloud running from his
throate, wherein an headleſſe Arrowe
ſticketh, through which wound,
he ratleth out this Rhime.
         
         
            Howe the Lorde Clifforde for his
extreame crueltie, came to a cruel, ſtraunge, &amp; ſodaine
death. Anno. 1461.
            
               
                  OPen confeſſion aſketh open Penaunce,
               Yet wiſdome would a man his fault ſhould hide:
               But ſith pardon commeth by repentaunce,
               Playneſſe is beſt when truth is plainly tryde,
               Open or hid, al faultes at length be ſpyed.
               For couer fyer neuer ſo cloſe within,
               Yet out it will and ſo will ſecret ſynne.
            
            
               As for my ſelfe, my faultes be out ſo playne,
               Bruted and knowne abroade in euery place,
               That though I would I cannot them reteyne,
               Al care is booteleſſe in a cureleſſe caſe,
               To learne by others ſome haue had the grace,
               Wherfore Baldwin, write thou my wretched fall,
               The brief wherof I briefly vtter ſhal.
            
            
               
               Clifford I am that ſlue Duke Richards childe,
               The louely babe that craued lyfe with teares:
               Wherby my fame, moſt fouly I defiled
               Pore ſely Lambes the Lyon neuer teares,
               The feble mouſe may ly among great beares
               But wrath of man his rancoure to requyt,
               Forgets al reaſon, ruth and mercy quyte.
            
            
               I meane ſuch wrath as works parental wreke
               Surnamed a vertu (as theſe reuengers ſay)
               But little know thoſe people what they ſpeak
               Which kyndle vs, our ennemis kin 
                     •
                  o ſlay,
               To puniſhe ſinne is good, it is no nay.
               They wreke not ſinne, but merit wreke for ſinne,
               The fathers faultes that wreake vpon the kinne.
            
            
               Becauſe my father Lord Iohn Clifforde died
               Slayne at S. Albanes, in his princes ayde,
               Againſt the Duke my hart for malice fried,
               So that I could from wreke no way be ſtayde
               But to auenge my fathers death aſſayd
               Al means I might the Duke of Yorke tannoy:
               And all his kyn and frendes to kil and ſtroy.
            
            
               This cauſed me with bloudy dagger woūd
               His giltles ſonne that neuer agaynſt me ſtord:
               The fathers corps dead lying on the ground,
               The necke I cut aſunder with my ſword
               The bleding head I pight by way of borde,
               Vpon a ſpeare, with a white paper crowne
               And in great ſcorne I ſent it to Yorke towne.
            
            
               
               But cruel deedes can neuer ſcape the ſcourge
               Of open ſhame, or of ſome bloudy death,
               Repentance ſelfe that other ſinnes may pourge,
               Doth fly from this, ſo ſore the ſoule it ſlayeth,
               Deſpayre diſſolues the tyrants bluſtring breath:
               For vengeance due doth ſodaynly alight,
               On cruel deedes the miſchiefe to requite,
            
            
               This find I true, for as I lay in ſtale
               Agaynſt Coward Duke Richards eldeſt ſonne
               My death I caught not far from Dintingale
               For as I would my gorget haue vndone
               To vent out heate traueiling in the ſonne
               An headles arrowe percyd my throte boule
               Which parted ſtraight my body from the ſoule.
            
            
               Was this a chance? no ſure Gods iuſt award
               Wherin his iuſtice playnly doth appeare:
               An headles arrow payd me my reward,
               For headding Richard lying on his bere,
               And as I would his child in no wyſe heare,
               So ſodayne death bereft my tongue the power
               To aſke mercy at my laſt dying houre.
            
            
               Wherfore Baldwin perſwade the bloudy ſort.
               To leaue their wrath, and rigour to refrayne:
               Tel cruel iudges horror is the port
               To which they ſayle to ſuffer endles payne
               Hel haſeth tyrants down to death amayne.
               Was neuer yet nor ſhalbe cruel dede
               Vnquy
                     •
                  ed lefe but had as cruel meede.

               WHan this tragedy was ended, O Lord ſaid
another, how horrible a thing is diuiſion in
a Realme, to how manye miſchieues is it
the mother, what vice is not thereby kindled, what
vertue left vnquenched?
            For what was the cauſe of the Duke of Yorkes
death and of the cruelty ſhewed to his young ſonne
by this mercileſſe man, ſaue the variaunce betwene
King Henry and the houſe of Yorke: which at length
beſides millions of the Commons, brought to
deſtruction moſt part of the nobility. For Edward
the Dukes eldeſt ſonne immediatly after Richarde
his father was ſlayne, through helpe of the Neuils
gaue the kinge a battaile at Towton in Yorkeſhire,
whereat beſydes this Clifford, were ſlayne y•
Earles of Northumberlande, and Weſtmerland,
with the Lordes Dacres and Welles, beſydes mo
then 3000. men, the winning of which fyeld brought
Edward to the Crowne, and the loſſe draue K.
Henry and his wyfe into Scotland. But as fewe
raignes beginne without bloud, ſo King Edwarde
to keepe the cōmon courſe, cauſed Thomas Courtney
earle of Deuonſhyre, and Iohn Veer Earle of
Oxenford, and Awbrey Veer eldeſt ſonne to y• ſaid
Earle, with diuers other of King Henries parte, to
bee attainted and put to death. And ſhortly after
did execution vppon the Duke of Somerſet, and
the Lordes Hungerford, &amp; Roſſe, whom hee tooke
priſoners at Exham fyelde. For thyther

came thoſe Lordes with king Henry out of Scotland,
with an armye of Scots, and ſought a Battayle,
which they loſt, wherein moſt part of theym
were ſlaine. And becauſe theſe are al noble men I
wil leaue them to Baldwins diſcrecion.
            But ſeeinge the Earle of Worceſter was the chiefe
inſtrument, whom king Edward vſed aſwel in
theſe mens matters, as in like bloudye affayres,
becauſe he ſhould not be forgotten,
ye ſhal heare what
may bee noted by his
ende.
         
         
            THE INFAMOVS ENDE
of the Lord Tiptoft, Earle of VVorceſtre,
for executing his princes crueltie.
Anno. 1470.
            
               
                  THe glorious man, is not ſo loath to Wurke,
               As the infamous glad to lye vnknowen:
               Which maketh me Baldwin diſalow thy lurke,
               Where Princes faultes ſo openly be blowen,
               I ſpeake not this alonelye for mine owne
               Which were my Princes (if that they were anye)
               But for my Pieres, in number very many.
            
            
               Or might report vprightly vſe her tongue,
               It would leſſe greeue vs to augment the matter.
               But ſure I am thou ſhalt be forſt among,
               To frayne the truth, the liuing for to flatter:
               And other whiles in pointes vnknowen to ſmatter.
               For time neuer was, nor neuer I thinke ſhalbe
               That truth vnſhent, ſhould ſpeake in al things free.
            
            
               
               This doth appere (I dare ſay) by my ſtorye,
               Which diuers wryters diuerſly declare,
               But ſtory wryters ought for neither glory,
               Feare, nor fauor, truth of things to ſpare,
               But ſtil it fares as alwayes it did fare,
               Affections, feare, or doubtes that dayly brue,
               Do cauſe that ſtories alwayes be not true.
            
            
               Vnfruiteful Fabian followed the face
               Of time and dedes, but let the cauſes ſlip,
               Which Hall hath added ſome with better grace,
               For feare I thinke leſt trouble might him trip:
               For this or that (ſayth he) he felt the whip.
               This ſtory wryters leaue the cauſes out,
               Or ſhew them ſo as they were in ſome dout.
            
            
               But ſeyng cauſes are the chefeſt thinges
               That ſhould be noted of the ſtory wryters,
               That men may learne what endes al cauſes bringes,
               They be vnworthy the name of Chroniclers
               That leaue them cleane out of their regiſters,
               Or doubtfully report them for the fruite
               Of reading ſtoryes ſtandeth in the ſuite.
            
            
               Wherfore Baldwin either ſpeake thou vpryght
               Of our affaiers, or touch them not at all
               As for my ſelfe I way al thinges ſo lyght,
               That naught I paſſe, how men report my fall
               The truth wherof yet playnly ſhewe I ſhal
               That thou mayſt wryte and other therby reede,
               What thinges I did wherof they ſhould take heede.
            
            
               
               Thou haſt heard of Tiptoftes Earles of Worceſter,
               I am that Lorde that lyued in Edwardes dayes
               The fowerth, and was his frend and counſailour,
               And Butcher too, as common rumor ſayes.
               But Peoples voyce is neither ſhame nor prayſe,
               For whom they would aliue deuour to daye,
               To morow dead they wil worſhip what they may.
            
            
               But though the peoples verdite go by chaunce,
               Yet was their cauſe to call mee as they did,
               For I enforſt by meane of Gouernaunce,
               Did execute what ere my king did bid,
               From blame therein my ſelfe I cannot ryd:
               But fye vpon the wretched ſtate that muſt,
               Defame it ſelfe to ſerue the Princes luſt.
            
            
               The chiefeſt cryme wherewith men dome charge,
               Is death of the Earle of Deſmundes noble ſonnes,
               Of which the kinges charge doth me cleare diſcharge
               By ſtrait commaundement and iniunctions:
               Theffect whereof ſo rigourouſlye runnes
               That either I muſt procure to ſee them dead,
               Or for contempt as traytour looſe my head.
            
            
               What would mine enemies doe in ſuch a caſe,
               Obey the king or proper death procure?
               They may wel ſay their fancy for a face,
               But life is ſweete and loue hard to recure,
               They would haue done as I did I am ſure:
               For ſeeldom wil a wealthy man ateaſe,
               For others cauſe his Prince in ought diſpleaſe.

               How much leſſe I which was lieutenaunt than
               In the Iriſh Iſle, preferred by the king:
               But who for loue or dread of any man
               Conſentes to accompliſh any wicked thing,
               Although chiefe fault thereof from other ſpring,
               Shal not eſcape Gods vengeaunce for his deede:
               Who ſcuſeth none that dare do il for dreede.
            
            
               This in my king and mee may wel appeare,
               Which for our faultes did not eſcape the ſcourge:
               For whan we thought our ſtate moſt ſure and cleare,
               The wynde of Warwicke blew vp ſuch a ſourge,
               As from the realme and crowne, the king did vrge,
               And me alſo from office, frendes and wyfe,
               From good report, from honeſt death and life.
            
            
               The Earle of Warwicke, through mallice and grudge,
               Which to King Edward cauſeleſſe he did beare,
               Out of his Realme by force did make him trudge,
               And ſet King Henrie againe vpon his chaire,
               And than al ſuch as Edwardes louers were
               As traytaurs tane, were greuouſly oppreſt,
               But chiefelye I, becauſe I loued him beſt.
            
            
               And ſi
                     •
                  h my goods, and liuinges were not ſmal,
               Some greedy gulles did beare the world in hand
               For ten yeares ſpace that I was cauſe of all
               Murder, and miſchiefe, done within the land,
               For this did ſuch as did not vnderſtand
               Mine enmies drift, thinke all reportes were true:
               And ſo to hate me worſe then any Iewe.
            
            
               
               For ſeeldome ſhal a ruler looſe his lyfe,
               Before falſe rumours openly be ſpred,
               Whereby this prouerbe is as true as ryfe,
               That rulers rumors hunt about a head,
               Frowne Fortune once all good report is fled,
               For preſent ſhew doth make the mainy blinde,
               And ſuch as ſee dare not diſcloſe their mynde.
            
            
               Through this was I king Edwards butcher named
               And bare the ſhame of all his cruel deedes:
               I cleare me not I worthely was blamed,
               Though force was ſuch I muſt obaye him needes,
               With hieſt rulers ſeldome wel it ſpeedes,
               For they be euer neareſt to the nyp,
               And fault who ſhal, for al feele they the whyp.
            
            
               For whan I was by Parliament attainted,
               King Edwardes euils al were counted mine.
               No truth auayled ſo lies were faſt and painted,
               Which made the People at my life repine,
               Crying Crucifige kil that Butchers lyne,
               That whan I ſhould haue gone to Blockham feaſt
               I could not paſſe, ſo ſore they on me preſt.
            
            
               And had not bene the officers ſo ſtrong,
               I thinke they would haue ſwalowed me alyue,
               Howbeit hardly haled from the throng,
               I was in the Fleete faſt ſhrowded by the Shriue,
               Thus one dayes lyfe their mallice did me giue:
               Which when they knew, for ſpite the next day after,
               They kept them calme, ſo ſuffred I the ſlaughter
            
            
               
               Now tel me Baldwin what fault doeſt thou fynde
               In me, that iuſtly ſhould ſuch death deſerue?
               None ſure, except deſire of honour blinde,
               VVhich made me ſeeke in offices to ſerve:
               VVhat minde ſo good that honours make not ſwerue?
               So mayſt thou ſee it onely was myſtate
               That cauſed my Death and brought me ſo in hate.
            
            
               Warne therfore al men wiſely to beware,
               What offices they enterpriſe to beare:
               The higheſt alway moſt maligned are,
               Of Peoples grudge, and princes hate in feare,
               For Princes faultes his faultors al men teare.
               Which to auoyde, let none ſuch office take,
               Saue he that can for right his Prince forſake.

                  •
               iniſhed, but one of the company had prouided
for another, of a notable perſon Lorde
Tiptoftes chiefe Enemie, concerning whom hee
ſaid: Lord God what truſt is there in worldly chaū
               ces?
what ſtay in any proſperity? for ſee the Earle
of Warwicke which cauſed the earle of Worceſter
to be apprehended, attainted, and put to death, triumphing
with his old impriſoned &amp; new vnpriſonned
Prince K. Hēry, was by &amp; by after &amp; his brother
with him, ſlayne at Barnet field by king Edward
whom he had before time damaged diuers wayes.

As firſt by his frendes at Banbury fielde, where to
reuēge the death of his coſin Henry Neuil ſir Iohn
Coniers, and Iohn Clappā his ſeruaūtes ſlew 5.

the Earle of Pembroke, &amp; ſir Richarde Harbert his

ſir Richard Harbert was the talleſt gentlemā both
of his perſon &amp; hands that euer I read or hearde of.
At which time alſo, Robin of Ridſdale, a rebell of
therle of Warwicks rayſing, toke the earle Riuers
K. Edwards wiues father, and his ſonne Iohn, at
his mannour of Grafton, &amp; caryed them to Northhampton,
and there without cauſe or proces beheaded
them: Whiche ſpites to requite, king Edwarde
cauſed the Lorde Stafford of Southwike, one of
Warwickes chiefe 
                  ••
               indes, to be taken at Brente
march, and headed at Bridgewater.
            This cauſed yt Earle ſhortlye to rayſe his power, to
encounter the kinge which came againſt him with
an armye, beſide Warwicke at Wol
                  •
               ey, where he
wan the field, toke the king priſoner, and kept him a
while in Yorkeſhyre in Middleham caſtle: whence
(as ſom ſay) he releaſed him again, but other think
he corrupted his kepers &amp; ſo eſcaped. Then throughe
the Lords ye matter was taken vp betweene them
&amp; they broughte to talke together, but becauſe they
could not agre, y• earle araiſed a new army, wherof
he made Captaine the Lord Welles ſonne, whyche
broile king Edward minding to appeaſe by pollicy

fouly diſtained his honour committing periury for
he ſente for the Lorde Welles and his brother Syr
Thomas Dymocke, vnderſafe conduite promiſing
them vpon his fayth to keepe them harmeleſſe: But
after, becauſe yt Lord Welles ſonne would not diſſolue
his army, beheaded theim both &amp; went wt hys
power into Lincolnſhyre &amp; there fought with Sir
Robert Welles, and ſlew ten thouſand of his ſouldiers
(yet ran they a way ſo faſt, that caſting of their
clothes for yt more ſpeede, cauſed it to be called Loſe
coate fielde (and toke ſir Robert and other, and put
them to death in the ſame place.
            This miſfortune forced the Earle of Warwicke to
ſayle into Fraunce where he was entertayned of y•
kinge a while, and at laſt with ſuch pore helpe as he
procured there of Duke Rainer, and other, he came
into England agayne, and encreaſed ſutch a power
in kinge Henries name, that as the Lorde Tiptofte
ſayd in his tragedy, kinge Edward vnable to abide
him, was fayne to flie ouer the waſhes in Lincolnſhyre
to get a ſhip to ſayle out of his kingdom to his
brother in lawe the Duke of Burgoine: So was
king Henry reſtored againe to yt kingdome. Al theſe
deſpites, and troubles the Earle wroughte agaynſt
kinge Edward. But Hēry was ſo infortunate that
ere halfe a yeare was expyred, kinge Edward came
backe agayne, and empriſoned him, &amp; gaue ye Earle
a fielde, wherein he ſlewe both him, and his brother.
I haue recounted thus much before hand for ye better

opening of the ſtory, which if it ſhould haue bin
ſpoken in his Tragedy would rather haue made a
volume than a Pamphlete. For I entend onely to
ſay in ye Tragedy, what I haue noted in the Earle
of Warwickes perſon, wiſhinge that theſe other
noble men, whō I haue by the way touched, ſhould
not be forgotten.
            And therefore imagin that you ſee this Earle lyinge
wt his brother in Poules Church in his Coate
armure, with ſutch a Face, and Countenaunce as
hee beareth in Portrayture ouer ye dore in Poules
at the goinge downe to Ieſus Chapple from
the South end of the Quier ſtayres,
and ſayinge as followeth.

               The French kings daughter, whom he did forſake:
               For while with payne I brought this ſute to paſſe,
               He to a widow raſhly wedded was.
            
            
               This made the French king ſhreudly to miſtruſt,
               That all my treaties had but ill pretence,
               And when I ſaw my king ſo bent to luſt,
               That with his fayth he paſt not to diſpence,
               Which is a Princes honours chiefe defence:
               I could not reſt til I had found a meane.
               To mend his miſſe, or els to marre him cleane.
            
            
               Wherfore I me allied with his brother George,
               Encenſing him his brother to maligne
               Through many a tale I did agaynſt him forge:
               So that through power that we from Calais bringe
               And found at home we fcayd ſo the kynge,
               That he did flye to Freſeland warde amayn,
               Wherby king Henry had the crown agayne.
            
            
               
               Than put we therle of Worceſter to death
               King Edwardes frend a man lo fowle defamed
               And in the whyle came Edward into breath.
               For with the Duke of Burgoyne ſo he framed
               That with the power that he to him had named,
               Vnloked for he came to England ſtreight
               And got to Yorke and tooke the towne by ſleight.
            
            
               And after through the ſufferance of my brother,
               Which like a beaſt occaſion fouly loſt,
               He came to London ſafe with many other
               And tooke the towne to good king Henryes coſt:
               Who was through him from poſt to piller toſt,
               Til Therle of Oxeford, I and other more,
               Aſſembled power his fredome to reſtore.
            
            
               VVher of king Edward warned came with ſpede,
               And camped with his hoaſt in Barnet towne
               Where we right fearce encountered him in deede
               On Eaſter day right early on the downe:
               There many a man was ſlayne and ſtriken downe
               One either ſide and neyther part did gayne
               Til that I and my brother both were ſlayne.
            
            
               For we to hart our ouermatched men,
               Forſake out ſtedes, and in the thickeſt thronge,
               Ran preacing forth on f

                  te, and fought ſo then
               That downe we draue them wer they neuer ſo ſtrōg
               But ere this lucke had laſted very long:
               With number and force we were ſo fouly cloyed,
               And reſcue fayld, that quite we were diſtroyed,
            
            
               
               Now tell me Baldwin haſt thou hard or read
               Of any man that did as I haue done?

               Perchaunce thou thinkſt my doinges were not ſuch
               As I and other do affirme they were.
               And in thy mynd I ſe thou muſeſt much
               What meanes I vſde, that ſhould me ſo preferre:
               Wherin becauſe I wil thou ſhalt not erre
               The truth of al I wil at large recite,
               The ſhort is this: I was no hypocrite.
            
            
               I neuer did nor ſayd ſaue what I ment,
               The common weale was ſtil my chefeſt care
               To priuate gayn or glory was I neuer bent,
               I neuer paſt vpon delicious fate.
               Of nedeful foode my bord was neuer bare,

                   creditour did curſe me day by day
               I vſed playneneſſe, euer pitch and pay.
            
            
               I heard poore ſouldiers and pore workmen whyne
               Becauſe their dutyes were not truely payd.
               Agayne I ſaw how people did repyne
               At thoſe through whom their payments wer delayde
               And profe did oft aſſure (as ſcripture ſayd)
               That god doth wreke the wretched peoples greues.
               I ſaw the polles cut of from polling theues.
            
            
               
               This made mee alway iuſtly for to deale,
               VVhich whan the people plainely vnderſtoode,
               Becauſe they ſaw me minde the common weale.
               They ſtill endeuoured how to do me good,
               Ready to ſpend their ſubſtaunce, life, and bloud,
               In any cauſe whereto I did them moue:
               For ſuer they were it was for their behoue.
            
            
               And ſo it was. For whan the Realme decayed
               By ſutch as good Kinge Henry ſore abuſed,
               To mend the ſtate I gaue his Enemies ayd:
               But whan Kinge Edward ſinfull pra

                  ks ſtill vſed,
               And would not mend, I likewiſe him refuſed:
               And holpe vp Henry, better of the twayne,
               And in his Quarrell (iuſt I thinke) was ſlayne.
            
            
               And therefore Baldwin teach by proofe of mee,
               That ſutch as couet peoples loue to get,
               Muſt ſee their workes, and wordes in all agree:
               Lyue liberally, and keepe them out of det,
               On common weale let all their care be ſet:
               For vpright dealinge, debts payd, poore ſuſtayned,
               Is meane whereby all harts are throughly gayned.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
               AS ſoone as y• Earle had ended this admonition,
ſure (ſaid one) I thinke the Earle of
Warwick although hee were a glorious
man hath ſayde no more of himſelfe than
what is true. For if hee had not had notable good

vertues, or vertuous qualities, and vſed lawdable
meanes in his trade of life, the people would neuer
haue loued him, as they did: But God be wt him, &amp;
ſend his ſoule reſt, for ſure his body neuer had any.
And although he dyed, yet ciuill warres ceaſed not.
For immediatly after his deth came Queene Margaret
with a power out of Fraunce, bringing with
her, her yongue ſone Prince Edward: &amp; with ſutch
frendes as ſhe founde here, gaue Kinge Edward a
battell at Thewkeſbury, where both ſhee, and her
ſonne were taken pryſoners, with Edmond Duke
of Somerſet her chief captayne: whoſe ſonne Lord
Ihon, and the Earle of Deuonſhire were ſlayne in
fight, and the Duke himſelfe with diuers other immediatly
beheaded. Whoſe infortunes are worthy
to be remembred, chiefly Prince Edwards, whom
the King for ſpeaking truth, cruelly ſtroke with his
Gaunt
                  •
               et, &amp; his Brethren cruelly murthered. But
ſeeinge yt time ſo farre ſpent, I will paſſe them ouer,

                  •
               r beheaded
at Southampton: whoſe commotiō made
in Kent, was cauſe of ſely Henries deſtruction. And
ſeing king Henry himſelf was cauſe of the deſtruction
of many noble princes, beinge of all other moſt
vnfortunate hymſelfe, I will declare what I haue
noted in hys vnlucky lyfe: Who wounded in
Pryſon with a Dagger, may lament
his wretchedneſſe in manner
followinge.

               But God doth guide the World, and euery hap by ſkill,
               Our Wit, and willinge power are payzed by his will:
               What wit moſt wiſely wardee, and will moſt deadly vrkes,
               Though all our power would preſſe it downe, doth daſhe our wareſt wurkes.
            
            
               Than Deſteny, our ſinne, Gods will or els his wreake
               Do worke our wretched woes, for humours be to weake:

               So ſinne and they be one, both working like effect,

               The ſecond doth deſerue due puniſhment for vice:
               This witneſſeth the wrath, and that the loue of God
               The good for loue, yt bad for ſinne, God beateth with his rod.
            
            
               Although my ſundry ſynnes do place me with the worſt,
               My haps yet cauſe me hope to be among the firſt:
               The eye that ſearcheth al and ſeeth euery thought,
               Is iudge how ſore I hated ſinne, and after vertue ſoughte.
            
            
               That ſolace of my ſoule my chiefeſt pleaſure was,
               Of worldly pomp, of fame, or game, I did not paſſe:
               My kingdomes nor my crowne I pryſed not a crum,
               In heauen were my riches heapt, to which I ſoughte to com,
            
            
               
               Yet were my ſorrowes ſutch as neuer man had like,
               So diuers ſtormes at once, ſo often did mee ſtrike:
               But why, God knowes, not I, except it were for this
               To ſhewe by paterne of a Prince, how brittle honour is.
            
            
               Our kingdomes are but cares, our ſtate deuoyde of ſlaye,
               Our riches ready ſnares, to haſten our decaye:
               Our pleaſures, priuy pricks, our vices to prouoke,
               Our pōpe, a pumpe, our fame, a flame, our powre, a ſmouldrīg ſmoke.
            
            
               I ſpeake not but by proofe, and that may many rue,
               My life doth cry it out, my death doth try it true:
               VVhereof I will in briefe, rehearſe the heauy hap,
               That Baldwī in his woful warp, my wretchednes may wrap
            
            
               In Windſore borne I was: and bare my fathers name,
               VVho won by warre all Fraunce to his eternall fame:
               And left to me the crowne, to be receiu'de in peace
               Through mariage made wt Charles his heyre vpon his lifes deceaſe,
            
            
               VVhich ſhortly did enfue, yet dyed my father furſt,
               And both the Realmes were mine ere I a yeare were nurſt:
               VVhich as they fell to ſoone, ſo faded they as faſt
               For Charles, and Edward got them both or forty yeres were paſt.
            
            
               This Charles was eldeſt ſonne of Charles my father in law,
               To whom as heire of Fraūce, the Frenchmen did them draw:
               But Edward was the heyre of Richard Duke of Yorke,
               The heyre of Roger Mortimer: ſlaine by the kerne of Korke.
            
            
               
               Before I came to age Charles had recouered Fraunce,
               And kild my men of Warre, ſo lucky was his chaunce:
               And through a mad cōtract I made with Raynerds daughter
               I gaue and loſt all Normandy, the cauſe of many a ſlaughter.

               Becauſe I there by brake a better precontract:
               Than of the flattering Duke that firſt the mariage made,
               The iuſt rewarde of ſuch as dare their Princes ill perſwade.
            
            
               And I poore ſeely wretch abode the brunt of all,
               My mariage luſt ſo ſweete, was mixt with bitter Gall.
               My Wyfe was wiſe and good, had ſhe bin rightly ſought,
               But our vnlawful getting it, may make a good thing nought.
            
            
               Wherefore warne men beware, how they iuſt promiſe breake
               Leaſt proofe of paynful plagues do cauſe them waile ye wreake
               Aduiſe well ere they graunt, but what they graūt performe,
               For God wil plague al doublenes although we fele no worm.
            
            
               I falſly borne in hande, beleeued I did well,
               But all thinges be not true that learned men do tell:
               My clergy ſayd a Prince was to no promiſe bound,
               Whoſe words to be no Goſpell tho I to my griefe haue foūd
            
            
               For after mariage ioynd Queene Margaret and me,
               For one miſhap afore, I dayly met with three,
               Of Normandy, and Fraūce, Charles got away my Crowne,
               The duke of Yorke &amp; other ſought at home to put me downe.
            
            
               
               
                  Bellona rang the bel at home and al abrode,
               With whoſe miſhaps amayne fell Fortune did me lode:
               In Fraunce I loſt my forces, at home the foughten fielde,
               My kynred ſlayne, my frendes oppreſt, my ſelfe enforſt to yeld
            
            
               Duke Richard tooke me twiſe, and forſt me to reſine
               My crowne and titles due vnto my fathers line:
               And kept me as a warde did al thinges as him liſt,
               Til yt my wife through bloudy ſword had rane me frō his fiſt.
            
            
               But though we ſlewe the Duke my ſorrowes did not ſlake,
               But like to Hyders heade ſtil more and more awake:
               For Edward through the ayde of VVarwicke &amp; his brother
               From one field draue me to the Scots, &amp; toke me in another
            
            
               Then went my frends to wracke, for Edward ware y• crown
               For which for nine yeares ſpace his priſon held me down:
               Yet thence through Warwickes worke I was again releaſt,
               And Edward driuen fro y• realme to ſeke his frends by Eaſt.
            
            
               But what preuaileth payne or prouidence of man,
               To helpe him to good hap, whom deſteny doth ban?
               VVho moyleth to remoue the rocke out of the mud,
               Shall mier himſelfe and hardly ſcape the ſwelling of the find
            
            
               This al my frendes haue found, and I haue felt it ſo
               Ordaynde to be the touch of wretchednes and woe,
               For ere I had a yeare poſſeſt my ſeat agayne,
               I loſt both it and liberty, my helpers al were ſlaine.
            
            
               
               For Edward firſt by ſtealth, and ſith by gathered ſtrength,
               Arriude and got to Yorke, and London at the length:
               Tooke me and tyed me vp, yet warwicke was ſo ſtout,
               He came with power to Barnet field, in hope to helpe me out
            
            
               And there alas was ſlayne, with many a worthy knight.
               O Lord that euer ſuch lucke ſhould hap in helping right:
               Laſt came my wife and ſonne, that long lay in exile,
               Defied the king, and fought a field, I may dewaile the while.
            
            
               For there mayne onely ſonne, not thirtene yeare of age
               Was tane, and murdred ſtreight by Edward in his rage:
               And ſhortlye I my ſelfe to ſtint al further ſtrife,
               Stabbe with his brothers bloudy blade in priſon loſt my life
            
            
               Lo here the heauy 
                     •
                  aps, which hapned me by heape,
               See here the pleaſaunt fruictes, that many Princes reape,
               The paynfull plagues of thoſe yt breake their lawful bandes.
               Their mede which may &amp; wil not ſaue their frends fro bloudy handes.
            
            
               God graunt my woful haps, tao greuous to rehearſe,
               May teach al ſtates to know how diepely daungers pearce:
               How frayle al honours are, how brittle worldly bliſſe,
               That warned through my fearful fate they feare to do amiſſe
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            THis tragedy ended, another ſayd: either you
or Kinge Henry are a good Philoſopher ſo
narrowly to argue ye cauſes of miſfortunes?
but there is nothinge to experience which taught,
or might teach the kinge this leſſon.
            But to proceede in our matter: I fynde mention
here ſhortly after ye death of this king, of a Duke of
Exceſter founde deade in the ſea betwene Douer &amp;
Calais, but what hee was, or by what aduenture
he died, maiſter Fabian hath not ſhewed, and maiſter
Hall hath ouerſkipped him: ſo that excepte we
be frendlier vnto him, he is like to be double drowned,
both in ſea, and in the gulfe of forgetfulnes. About
this matter was much talke, but becauſe one
tooke vpon him to ſeeke out that ſtory, that charge
was committed to him.
            And to be occupied in ye meane while I haue foūde
the ſtory of one drowned likewiſe, and that ſo notable,
though priuily, that all the world knew of it
wherefore I ſayd: becauſe night approcheth, and y•
we will looſe no time, yee ſhall heare what I haue
noted concerning the Duke of Clarence, king
Edwards brother, who al to be waſhed
in Wyne, may bewayle his infortune
after this maner.

            HOW GEORGE PLANtagenet
thirde Sonne of the Duke of
Yorke, was by his Brother. K. Edward wrongfully impryſoned,
and by hys Brother Richarde miſerably murdered
the. 11. of Ianuary. Anno.
1448.
            
               THe Foule is fowle men ſay, that files the Neſt,
               Which makes me loth to ſpeake, now might I chuſe,

               And Fame blowne vp the blaſt of all abuſe,
               My ſilence rather might my life accuſe
               Than ſhroude our ſhame, though fayne I would it ſo
               For truth will out, although the world ſay no.
            
            
               Wherefore Baldwin with tearis I the beſeech
               To pauſe a while vpon my heauy plaint,
               And though vnneth I vtter ſpeedy ſpeach,
               No fault of wit nor folly makes mee faint:
               No heady drincks hane geuen my tongue attaynt
               Through Quaffiuge craft, yet Wine my Wits confound
               Not which I drancke, but wherein I was dround.

               Becauſe my wyne bewrayes mee by the ſmell,
               For neuer creature was louſt in Bacchus dew
               To death, but I through Fortunes rigour fell:
               Yet that thou mayſt my ſtory better tell,
               I will declare as briefely as I may,
               My wealth, my wo, and cauſers of decay.
            
            
               
               The famous houſe ſurnam'de Plantagenet,

               His Lord King Richard quite beſide the Crowne,
               Though many a day it wanted due renowne,
               God ſo preferd by prouidence, and grace,
               That lawfull Heires did neuer fayle the Race.
            
            
               For Lionell Kinge Edwards ſecond child,
               Both Eame, and Heyre to Richard iſſuleſſe,
               Begot a Daughter Philip, whom vndefylde

               VVas ſonne to Edmond Langley Duke of Yorke:
               VVhich Edmond was fift brother to the ſame,
               Duke Lionell that al this Line doth Korke:
               Of which two houſes ioyned in a Forke,
               My Father Richard Prince Plantagenet
               True Duke of Yorke, was lawfull Heyre beget.
            
            
               VVho tooke to Wyſe as yee ſhall vnderſtand
               A Mayden of a Noble houſe, and olde,

               VVhoſe Sonne Earle Richard was a Baron bolde,
               And had the right of Saliſbury in hold,
               Through mariage made with good Earle Thomas Hayre,

               The Duke my father had by this his wyfe
               Fower ſonnes, of whom the eldeſt Edward hight,
               The ſecond Edmond who in youth did loſe his life,
               At Wakefield ſlayne by Clyfford cruell Knight,
               I George am third of Clarence Duke by right,

               (VVhoſe life, and death himſelfe declared earſt)

               And wan the Crowne as Warwicke hath rehearſt:
               The pride whereof ſo deepe his ſtomacke pearſt
               That litle paſſinge on them that brought him in,
               Forgat his frendes, and ſet at naught his kin.
            
            
               VVhich made the Earle of Warwicke to maligne,
               His dealinge ingrate, and to attempt away,
               From priſon to enlarge Henry the ſely Kinge,
               Him to reſtore to Kingdome if he may,
               And knowinge me, to be the chiefeſt ſtay
               My Brother had, he did me vndermine
               To his ill practiſe the ſooner to encline.
            
            
               VVhereto I was prepared longe before,
               Becauſe the king to me was ſo vnkinde:
               No canker ſure, ſoft fleſh doth fret ſo ſore,
               As vnkinde dealinge doth a louinge mynde.
               Loues ſtrongeſt bandes vnkindnes doth vnbynde,

               Chiefe frendes to foes, and brethren to debate.
            
            
               
               And though the Earle of Warwicke ſubtile ſire,
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                   I bare a grudge againſt my brother,
               Yet towarde his feate to ſet me more on fire,
               He kindled vp one firebrand with another:
               For knowinge Fancy was the forcinge rother
               VVhich ſtirreth youth to any kinde of ſtrife,
               Hee offred me his daughter to my Wife.
            
            
               VVhere through, and with his crafty filed tongue,
               He ſtale my heart that earſt vnſteady was:
               For I was witleſſe, wanton, fond, and yongue,
               VVhole bent to pleaſure, brittle as the glaſſe:
               I cannot lye, In vino veritas.
               
               I did eſteeme the bewty of my Bride
               Aboue my ſelfe, and all the world beſide.
            
            
               Theſe fond affections ioynd with lacke of ſkill,
               (Which trap the heart, and blinde the eyes of youth,
               And prickt the minde to practiſe any ill)
               So tickled me that voyde of kindely truth:
               (Which if it want all wretchedneſſe enſueth)
               I ſtinted not to perſecute my brother,
               Till time he left his kingdome to another.
            
            
               Thus carnall loue did quench the loue of kinde,
               Tyll luſt were loſt through fancy fully fed:
               But whan at length I came vnto my minde
               I ſaw how lewdly lightneſſe had me led,
               To ſeeke with payne the perill of my hed:
               For had Kinge Henry once bene ſetled, ſure,
               I was aſſuer'd my dayes could not endure.
            
            
               
               And therfor, though I bound my ſelfe with oth
               To help king Henry all that euer I might,
               Yet at the treaty of my Brethren both,
               VVhich reaſon graunted to require but right,
               I left his part whereby be periſht quite:
               And reconcil'de me to my Brethren twayne,
               And ſo came Edward to the Crowne agayne.
            
            
               This made my Father in law to treat, and fume,
               To ſtamp, and ſtare, and cal'de me falſe forſworne,
               And at the length with all his power preſume,
               To help Kinge Henry vtterly foriorne.
               Our frendly Profers ſtill he tooke in ſcorne,
               Refuſed peace, and came to Barnet field,
               And there was ki
                     •
                  'de becauſe he would not yeeld.
            
            
               Hys Brother alſo there with him was ſlayne,
               VVhereby decay'de the Keyes of Chiualry.
               For neuer liued the matches of them twayne,
               In Manhood, Power, and Martiall pollicy,
               In vertous thewes, and frendly conſtancy,

               But what ſhalbe, ſhalbe: there is no choyſe,
               Thinges needes muſt driue as deſteny decreeth,
               For which ought in all out haps reioyſe,
               Becauſe the eye eterne, all thing foreſeeth
               VVhich to no ill at any tyme agreeth,

               The wounded man which muſt abide the ſmart,
               Of ſtitchinge vp, or ſearinge of his ſore,
               As thinge to had, reproues the Surgeons art
               VVhich notwithſtandinge doth his health reſtore,
               The childe likewiſe to Science plied ſore,
               Countes knowledge ill, his Teacher to be woode,
               Yet Surgery, and Sciences be good.
            
            
               But as the Pacients griefe, and Scholers payne,
               Cauſe them dreame bad ſutch thinges as ſure be beſt,
               So want of Wiſedome cauſeth vs complayne,

               Yet for our good, God worketh euery thinge:
               For through the death of theſe two noble Peeres
               My Brother liued, and raygned a quiet Kinge,
               VVho had they liued perchaunce in courſe of Yeares
               VVould haue deliuered Henry fro the Breres,
               Or holy his Sonne t'enioy the carefull crowne,
               VVhereby our Ligne ſhould haue bene quite put downe.
            
            
               A carefull Crowne it may be iuſtly named,
               Not for the cares which thereto bene annext,
               To ſee the Subiect well and duely framed,
               VVith which good care few Kinges are greatly vext
               But for the dread wherewith they are perplext,
               Of looſinge Lordſhip, Liberty, or Lyfe:
               VVhich wofull wracks in Kingdoms happen rife.
            
            
               
               The which to ſhun while ſome to ſore haue ſought.
               They haue not ſparde all perſons to ſuſpect:
               And to deſtroy ſutch as they guilty thought,
               Though no apparaunce proued them infect,
               Take me for one of this wronge puniſht ſect,
               Impriſoned firſt, accuſed without cauſe,
               And done to death no proceſſe had by lawes.
            
            
               VVherein I note how vengeaunce doth acquite
               Like ill, for ill, how vices vertue quell:
               For as my mariage loue did mee excite
               Agaynſt the Kinge my Brother to rebell,
               So loue to haue his children proſper well,
               Prouoked him againſt both lawe, and right,
               To murther me, his Brother, and his Knight.
            
            
               For by his Queene two Prince like Sonnes he had,
               Borne to bee puniſht for their Parentes ſinne:
               Whoſe Fortunes kalked made the father ſad,
               Sutch wofull haps were found to be therein:
               VVhich to auouch, writ in a rotten Skin,
               A propheſy was found which ſayd a G.
               Of Edwards children ſhould deſtruction be.
            
            
               Hee to bee G. becauſe my name was George,
               My brother thought, and therefore did me hate,
               But wo bee to that wicked heades that forge
               Sutch doubtfull dreames to breede vnkynde debate:
               For God, a Gleue, a Gibbet, Grate, or Gate,
               A Gray, a Griffeth, or a Gregory,
               As well as George are written with a G.
            
            
               
               Sutch doubtfull riddles are no prophecies.
               For prophecies, in writinge though obſcure,
               Are playne in ſence, the darke be very lies:
               VVhat God foreſheweth is euident, and pure,
               Truth is no Harold, nor no Sophiſt ſure:
               Shee noteth not mens Names, their Shieldes, nor Creaſts,
               Though ſhe compare them vnto Byrds, and Beaſts.
            
            
               But whom ſhe doth foreſhewe ſhall rayne by force,
               She tearms a Wolfe, a Dragon, or a Beare:
               A wilfull Prince a raynleſſe raging horſe.
               A Bore, a Lyon: a Coward mutch in feare
               A Hare, or Hart: a crafty, pricked Eare:
               A Letcherous, a Bull, a Goate, a Foale:
               An vndermyner, a Moldwarpe, or a Mole.
            
            
               By knowen beaſts thus truth doth playne declare
               VVhat men they be of whom ſhe ſpeakes before.
               And who ſo can mens properties compare
               And make what beaſt they do reſemble more,
               Shall ſoone diſcerne who is the grieſly bore.

               To know, and vtter Princes Actes to come,

               And euery broyle ſo throughly quenched was,
               That the Kinge my Brother quietly did raygne,
               I, reconſiled to his loue agayne,
               In proſperous health did leade a quiet life,
               For fiue yeares ſpace with honours laden rife.

                   I had bewayled a yeare,
               The Duke of Burgoyns wife dame Margaret
               My louinge ſiſter willinge me to cheare,
               To mary agayne did kindly me intreate:
               And wiſht me matched with a mayden neate,
               A ſtep daughter of hers, Duke Charles Heyre,
               A noble damſell, yonge, diſcreate, and Fayre.
            
            
               To whoſe deſire becauſe I did encline,
               The Kinge my brother doubtinge my degree
               Through Prophecies, agaynſt vs did repine:
               And at no hand would to our wils agree,
               For which ſutch rancour pearſt both him, and mee,
               That face to we fell at flat defiaunce,
               But were appeaſed by frendes of our aliaunce.
            
            
               Howbeit my mariage vtterly was daſht:
               VVherein becauſe my ſeruaunt ſayd his minde,
               A meane was ſought whereby he mought he laſht.
               And for they could no crime againſt him finde,
               They forg'de a fault, the peoples eyes to blinde,
               And tolde he ſhould by ſorceryes pretend,
               To bringe the Kinge vnto a ſpeedy end.
            
            
               Of all which poynctes, he was as innocent,
               As is the babe that lacketh kindly breath:
               And yet condemned by the Kinges aſſent,
               Moſt cruelly put to a ſhamefull death.
               This fyerd my heart, as foulder doth the heath:
               So that I could not but exclame, and cry,
               Agaynſt ſo great, and open Iniury.
            
            
               
               For this I was commaundedd to the Tower,
               The Kinge my Brother was ſo cruel harted:
               And whan my Brother Richard ſaw the hower
               VVas come, for which his heart ſo ſore had ſmarted,
               Hee thought it beſt take the time before it parted.
               For he endeuoured to attayne the Crowne,
               From which my life muſt needes haue held him downe.
            
            
               For though the Kinge within a while had dyed,
               As needes hee muſt, hee Surfayted ſo oft,
               I muſt haue had his Children in my guide
               So Richard ſhould beſide the Crowne haue coft:
               This made him ply, the while the Waxe was ſoft,
               To finde a meane to bringe mee to an ende,
               For Realme Rape ſpareth neyther Kin, nor freende.
            
            
               And whan hee ſaw how reaſon can aſſwage

               For all the worlde did know mine Innocence,
               Yet they agreed to charge me with offence.
            
            
               And couertly, within the Tower they cal'de
               A Queſt, to geue ſutch verdite as they ſhould:
               VVho what with feare, and what with fauour thral'de,
               Durſt not proudunce, but as my Brethren would.
               And though my falſe accuſers neuer could

               Bereue my lyfe by any common way,
               But like a Wolfe the Tiraunt Richard came,
               (My Brother, nay Butcher I may rightly ſay)
               Vnto the Tower, commaundinge all away,
               Saue ſutch as were prouided for the Feate,
               VVho, in this wiſe did ſtraungely mee entreate.
            
            
               His purpoſe was with a prepared ſtringe
               To ſtrangle mee: but I

               VVhich cauſed him that purpoſe to forgo.
               How beit they bound whether I would or no.
               And in a But of Malmeſy ſtandinge by,
               New chriſtened me becauſe I ſhould not cry.
            
            
               Thus dround I was yet for no due deſert,
               Except the zeale of Iuſtice be a crime:
               Falſe Prophecies Bewitcht Kinge Edwards hart.
               My Brother Richard to the Crowne would clime.
               Note theſe three cauſes in thy rufull rime:
               And boldly ſay they did procure my fall,
               And Death of Deaths moſt ſtraunge, and hard of all.
            
            
               And warne Princes Prophecies to eſchue,
               That are to darke, and doubtfull to be knowen
               VVhat God hath ſayd, that cannot but enſue,
               Though all the World would haue it ouer throwen.

               VVill Princes therefore not to thincke by murther,

Anuo. 1485
            
               
                  
                     MIſeremini mei ye that be my frends,
               This world hath formed me down to fall:
               How may I endure when that euery thing endes?
               VVhat creature is borne to be eternall?
               Now there is no more but pray for me all.
               Thus ſay I Edward that late was your king,
               And yeres xxii. bare Scepter ryall,
               Some vnto pleaſure and ſome to no lyking:
               Mercy I aſke of my miſdoing,
               VVhat auayleth it frendes to be my foe?
               Sith I cannot reſiſt, nor amend your complayning,
               Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio.
            
            
               I ſiepe now in mould as it is naturall,
               As earth vnto earth hath his reuerture:
               VVhat ordaynd God in the world uniuerſall,
               VVithout recourſe to the earth by nature,
               VVho to liue euer may himſelfe aſſure?
               VVhat is it to truſt to mutability,
               Sith that in this world nothing may endure?
               For now am I gone that was late in proſperity.
               To preſume therupon it is but vanity,
               Not certayn but as a chery fayre ful of wo,
               Rayned not I of late in great felicity,
               Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio
            
            
               
               VVhere was in my lyfe ſuch a one as I,
               VVhile Lady Fortune with me had continuance:
               Graunted not ſhe me to haue victory,
               In England to raygn and to contribute Fraunce,
               She toke me by the hand and led me adaunce,
               And with her ſugred lips on me ſhe ſmyled,
               But what for diſſembled countenaunce,
               I could not be ware til I was beguiled.
               Now from this world ſhe hath me exiled,
               VVhan I was lotheſt henſe for to go,
               And am in age who ſayth but a child,

               I had enough I held me not content,
               VVithout remembraunce that I ſhould dye:
               And moreouer to encroch ready was I bent,
               I knew not how long I ſhould it occupy,
               I made the tower ſtrong I wiſt not why,
               I knew not to whom I purchaſed Tater ſall.
               I mended Douer on the mountayne hye.
               And London I prouoked to fortify the wall,
               I made Notingham a place full royall.
               Windſore, Eltam, and many other mo,
               Yet at the laſt I went from them all.
               Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio.
            
            
               Where is now my conqueſt and victory?
               Where is my riches and royal aray?
               Wher be my courſers and my horſes hye?
               VVher is my mirth, my ſolace, and my play?
               As vanity to nought els is withred away:
               O Lady Bes long for me may you call,
            
            
               
               For I am departed vntil, domes day:
               But loue you that Lord that is ſouerayn of all.
               Where be my Caſtels and buildings royal?
               But Wyndſore alone now haue I no moe,
               And of Eton the prayers perpetuall,
               Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio.

               Saying a man is but a ſacke of ſtercory,

               Or els of ſtrong Sampſon, who can tell,
               Were not wormes ordaynd their fleſh to freate?
               And of Salamon that was of wit the wel,
               Abſolon profered his heere for to ſel,
               Yet for his bewty wormes eate him alſo
               And I but late in honours did excell,

               I haue playd my pageant, now am I paſt,

            HOVV SIR ANTHONY WOD
vile Lord Riuers and Scales, gouernour

               To ſhew theyr prince the meaning of the mynd
               That long haue bought their brokers ye as &amp; naies

               Which tyme attayned by attending al the yeare,
               The weried prince wil then no ſuters heare:
            
            
               
               My cauſe was ſuch not many dayes a goe,
               For after brute had blazed al abroade
               That one Baldwin by help of other moe,
               Of fame or ſhame fallen princes would vnloade,
               Out from our graues we ſtert without abode,
               And pre
                     •
                  ced forth among the ruful rout
               That ſought to haue their doings voulted out.
            
            
               But when I had long tended for my turne
               To tel my tale as dyuers other did:
               In hope I ſhould no lenger while ſoiourne
               But from my ſutes haue ſpedely bene rid,
               VVhan courſe and place both orderly had hid
               Me ſhew my mynd, &amp; I prepard to ſay
               The hearers pauſed aroſe and went their way.
            
            
               Theſe doubtful doings draue me to my dumps,
               Vncertayne what ſhoulde moue them ſo to do:
               I feared leſt affections lothly lumps,
               Or inward grudge, had moued them therto.
               Whoſe wicked ſtinges al ſtoryes truth vndo.
               Oft cauſing good to be reported ill,
               Or dround in ſuds of Laethes muddy ſwill.
            
            
               For hitherto ſly wryters wily wits
               VVhich haue engroſſed princes chiefe affayrs,
               Haue bene like horſes ſnaffled with the bittes
               Of fancy, feare, or doubtes ful dipe diſpayres,
               Whoſe rains enchayned to the chefeſt chayrs,

               That truth was forſt to chew or els to choke.
            
            
               
               This cauſed ſuch as lothed lowd to lye,
               To paſſe with ſilence ſundry prynces liues,
               Leſſe fault it is to leaue then lead awrye:
               And better draund then euer bound in gyues,
               For fatal fraud this world ſo fondly dryues.
               That what ſoeuer wryters braynes may brue
               Be it neuer ſo falſe, at length is cane for true.
            
            
               What harme may hap by helpe of lying pens,
               How written lies may lewdly be maintaynde,
               The lothly rytes, the deuiliſh idoll dens:
               VVith giltles bloud of vertuous men beſlainde,
               Is ſuch a profe as all good hartes haue plainde.
               The taly grounds of ſtoryes throughly 
                     •
                  ryes,
               The death of Martirs vengeance on it cryes.
            
            
               Far better therfore not to wryte at all,
               Then ſtayne the truth for any manner cauſe,
               For this they meane to let my ſtory fall:
               (Thought I and ere my tyme my volume clauſe,
               But after I knew it onely was a pauſe
               Made purpoſely, moſt for the readers eaſe
               Aſſure thee Baldwin, highly it did me pleaſe.
            
            
               For freſheſt wits I know wil ſone be weary,
               In reading long what euer booke it be,
               Except it be vayn matter ſtraunge or mery,
               Wel ſauſt with lyes and glared al with glee
               With which becauſe no graue truth may agree,
               The cloſeſt ſtile for ſtoryes is the meteſt,
               In rufull moads the ſhorteſt fourme is ſweteſt,
            
            
               
               And ſith the playntes already by thee pende,
               Are briefe enough, the number alſo ſmall,
               The tediouſnes I thinke doth none offend,
               Saue ſuch as haue no luſt to learn at all,
               Regard none ſuch: no matter what they brall.
               VVarne thou the wary leſt they hap to ſtumble,
               As for the careleſſe, care not what they mumble.
            
            
               My lyfe is ſuch as (if thou note it wel)
               May cauſe the wiſe, and welthy to beware.
               For their ſakes therfore playnly wil I tel,
               How falſe and combrous worldy honours are,
               How can
                     •
                  cred foes, bring carles folke to care
               How tyrantes ſuffered and not queld in tyme
               Do cut their throtes that ſuffer them to clyme.
            
            
               Neither wil I hyde the chefeſt poynt of all
               Which wiſeſt rulers leaſt of all regarde.
               That was and wil becauſe of many a fall,
               This cannot be to earneſtly declarde▪
               
               Becauſe it is ſo ſeeld and ſlackly heard.
               The abuſe and ſcorning of Gods ordinaunces,
               Is chefeſt cauſe of care and woful chaunces.
            
            
               Gods holy orders highly are abuſed,
               Whan men do chaunge their ends for ſtraunge reſpectes:
               They ſcorned are, when they be clean refuſed
               For that they cannot ſerue out fond affectes,
               The one our ſhame the other our ſinne detectes.
               It is a ſhame for Chriſtians to abuſe them,
               But deadly ſinne for ſcorners to refuſe them
            
            
               
               I meane not this al onely of degrees,
               Ordaynd by God for peoples preſeruation,
               But of his law, good orders, and decrees,
               Prouyded his creatures conſeruation
               And ſpecially the ſtate of procreation
               VVherin we▪ here the number of them encreaſe
               Which ſhal in heauen enioy eternal peace.
            
            
               The onely end why God ordained this,
               Was for the encreaſing of that bleſſed number
               For whom he hath prepard eternal bliſſe,
               They that refuſe it for the care or cumber
               Being apt therto are in a ſinful ſlumber:
               No fonde reſpect, no vayne deuyſed vowes
               Can quit or bar what God in charge allowes.
            
            
               It is not good for man to liue alone
               Sayd God: and therfore made he him a make:
               Sole life ſayd Chryſt is graunted few or none,
               All ſeede ſheders are bounde like wife to take:
               Yet not for luſt, for landes or riches ſake,
               But to beget and foſter ſo their fruite
               That heauen and earth be ſtored with the ſuit.
            
            
               But as this ſtate is damnable refuſed
               Of Many apt aud able thereunto,
               So is it likewyſe wickedly abuſed
               Of al that vſe it as they ſhould not doe:
               Wher̄in are gylty al the gredye who
               For gayne, for frendſhip, land, or honours wed,
               And theſe pollute the vndefyled bed.
            
            
               
               And therfore God through Iuſtice cannot ceaſe
               To plague theſe faultes with ſundry ſorts of whips:
               As diſagrement, healths or wealths decreaſe.
               Or lothing ſore the neuer liked lips,
               Diſdayne alſo with rigour ſometyme nyps
               Preſuming mates vnequally that match:
               Some bitter leauen ſowers the muſty batch.
            
            
               We worldly folke accompt him very wyſe
               That hath the wit moſt welthily to wed.
               By al means therfore alwayſe we deuyſe
               To ſee out iſſue rich in ſpouſals ſped.
               VVe buy and ſell rich orphanes: babes ſcant bred
               Muſt mary ere they know what mariage meanes.
               Boyes marry old trots, old fooles wed yong queans
            
            
               We call this wedding which in any wyſe
               Can be no mariage but pollucion playne.
               A new found trade of humain marchandiſe,
               The deuils net a filthy fleſhly gayne:
               Of kynd and nature an vnnatural ſtayne:
               A foule abuſe of gods moſt holy order
               And yet alloud almoſt in euery border.
            
            
               Would god I wer the laſt yt ſhal haue cauſe
               Agaynſt this creping cankar to complayne,
               That mē wold ſo regard their makers laws
               That al wold leaue ye lewdnes of their brain
               That holy orders holy might remayne.
               That our reſpects in weddīg ſhuld not choke
               The end &amp; fruit of gods moſt holy yoke.
            
            
               
               The ſage king Solon after that he ſaw,
               What miſchifs folow miſſought mariages,
               To barre al baits, eſtabliſhed this law.
               No frend nor father ſhal geue heritages,

               By any meane on pain of banning bale.
            
            
               Had this good lawe in Englād bene in force,
               My father had not ſo cruelly bene ſlayne.
               My brother had not cauſeles loſt his corps.
               Our mariage had not bred vs ſuch diſdain,
               My ſelf had lackt great part of greuous pain
               We wedded wyues for dignitye and lands
               And left our liues in enmies bloudy handes.

               Eſpouſde the Duches of Bedforde, &amp; by her
               Had iſſue males my brother Iohn, and mee

               Vs farre aboue the ſtate wherin we were.
               For he eſpouſed our ſiſter Elizabeth
               Whom Sir Iohn Gray made widow by his death:
            
            
               How glad were we think you of this aliance
               So nerely coupled with ſo noble a king,
               Who durſt with any of vs bene at defiance.
               Thus made of might the mightieſt to wring
               But ſie what cares do higheſt honors bring,

               Becauſe the kinge had made our ſiſter Quene
               It was his honoure to preferre hir kin.
               And ſith the redieſt way, as wyſeſt weene,
               Was firſt by wedding welthy heirs to win,

               Lord Bonuiles heyre: by whom he was poſſeſt
               In all the rytes wher through that houſe was bleſt
            
            
               The honours that my father atteind were diuers
               Firſt Chamberlayne, then conſtable he was,
               I do omit the gaynfulleſt Earle Riuers,
               Thus gliſtred we in glory cleare as glaſſe
               Such miracles can princes bring to paſſe
               Amonge their lieges whom they mynd to heaue
               To honors falſe, who al their geſtes deceiue
            
            
               Honors are like that cruel king of Thrace,
               With new com geſtes that fed his hungry horſes
               Or lyke the tyrant Buſiris whoſe grace
               Offred his gods al ſtraungers ſtrangled corſes.
               To forreiners ſo hard falſe honors force is
               That all her bourdens, ſtrangers either geaſtes.
               She ſpoyles to feede her Gods and gredy beaſtes
            
            
               
               Her Gods be thoſe whom God by law or lot.
               Or kynd by byrth, doth place in higheſt rowmes
               Her beaſtes be ſuch as gredely haue got
               Office or charge to guyde the ſely gromes.
               Theſe officers in law or charge are bromes,
               That ſwepe away the ſwete from ſymple wretches,
               And ſpoyle the enryched by their crafty fetches.
            
            
               Theſe plucke downe thoſe whom princes ſet aloft,
               By wreſtyng lawes, and falſe conſpiracies
               Yey kynges themſelues by theſe are ſpoyled oft,
               When wilful princes carleſly deſpyſe
               To heare thoppreſſed peoples heauy cryes.
               Nor wil correct their pollinge theues then god,
               Doth make thoſe reues the retchles princes rod.
            
            
               The ſecond Richard is a profe of this
               Whom crafty Lawyers by their lawes depoſed.
               An other patern good king Henry is
               Whoſe right by them haue diuerſly bene gloſed,
               Good whyle he grew, 
                     •
                  ad when he was vnroſed,
               And as the foadred theſe and diuers other
               With like deceit they vſed the kyng my brother.
            
            
               While he preuayled they ſayd he owed the crown,
               Al lawes and rightes agreed with the ſame
               But when by dryftes he ſemed to be downe.
               Al lawes and right extremely did him blame
               Nought ſaue vſurpinge traylour was his name.
               So conſtantly the Iudges conſtrue lawes,
               That all agre ſtil with the ſtronger cauſe.
            
            
               
               Theſe as I ſayd, and other like in charge
               Are honors horſes whom ſhe fedes with geſts,
               For al whom princes franckly do inlarge
               VVith dignityes theſe barke at in their breaſtes:
               Their ſpight, their might, their falſhode neuer reſts.
               Till they deuour them: ſparing neither bloud,
               Ne limme, ne life, and al to get their good.
            
            
               The Earle of warwicke was a praunſing courſer
               The hauty hart of his could beare no mate:
               Our welth through him waxt many a tyme y• worſer
               So cankardly he had our kin in hate.
               He troubled oft the kings vnſtedy ſtate
               And that becauſe he would not be his warde
               To wed and worke as he ſhould liſt a ward.
            
            
               He ſpyted vs becauſe we were preferd
               By mariage to dignities ſo great,
               But craftely his mallice be deferd
               Till traiterouſly be found meanes to entreat
               Our brother of Clarence to aſſiſt his feate:
               VVhom when he had by mariage to him bounde,
               Then wrought he ſtraight our linage to confound.
            
            
               Through ſlaunderous brutes he brued many a broyle
               Throughout the realme, againſt the king my brother
               And rayſed traiterours rebels thirſting ſpoyle
               To murder men: of whom among all other
               One Ro
                     •
                  in of Riddeſdale many a ſoule did ſmother
               His raſcall table at my father wroth
               Tooke ſier and ſonne, and quicke beheaded both.
            
            
               
               This haynous act although the king beteſted,
               Yet was he faine to pardon for the route
               Of rebelles all the realme ſo ſore infeſted,
               That every way aſſayld he ſtode in doubt:
               And though he were of courage bighe and ſtout,
               Yet he aſſayd by fayre meane to aſſwage
               His enemyes ire, reueyld by rebels rage.
            
            
               But VVarwicke was not pacifyed thus,
               His conſtant rancoure cauſeles was extreme
               No meane could ſerue my quarel to diſcus,
               Til he had driuen the king out of the realme.
               Neither would he then be awaked from his dreame.
               For when my brother was come and placed agayne,
               He ſtinted not til he was ſtoutly ſlayne.
            
            
               Than grew the king and Realme to quiet reſt,
               Our ſtocke and frends ſtil flying higher and higher,
               The Quene with children fruitefully was bleſt
               I gouernd them, it was the kinges deſire.
               This ſet their vncles furiouſly on fyer,
               That we the Quenes bloud wer aſſignde to gouerne
               The prince, not they, y• kings own bloud &amp; brethern.
            
            
               This cauſed the Duke of Clarence ſo to chafe
               That with the king hee braynles fel at bate:
               The counſayle warely for to kepe him ſafe
               From rayſing tumultes as he did of late,
               Impriſoned him: wher through his brothers hate
               He was condemnde, and murdred in ſuch ſort
               As he himſelfe hath truely made report,
            
            
               
               Was none abhorred theſe miſchiefs more then I
               Yet could I not be therwith diſcontented,
               Conſidering that his rancour touched me ny,
               Els would my conſcience neuer haue conſented.
               To wiſh him harme, could be haue bene contented.
               But feare of hurt, for ſauegard of our ſtate
               Doth cauſe more miſchiefe then deſert or hate.
            
            
               Such is the ſtate that many wiſh to beare,
               That either we muſt with others bloud be ſtaynd
               Or leade our lyues continually in feare,
               You mounting myndes behold here what is gaynd
               By combrous honour painfully attaynd:
               A damned ſoule for murdring them that hate you,
               Or doubtful lyfe in daunger leſt they mate you,
            
            
               The cauſe (I thinke) why ſome of high degree
               Do deadly hate all ſekers to aſſend,
               Is this: The cloyne contented cannot be
               With any ſtate til tyme he apprehend
               The higheſt top: for therto clymers tende.
               Which ſeldome is attaind without the wracke
               Of thoſe betwene, that ſtay and bare him backe.
            
            
               To ſaue themſelues they therfore are compeld
               To hate ſuch clymers, and with wit and power
               To compas means where through they may be queld
               Ere they aſſend their honours to deuour.
               This cauſde the Duke of Clarence frowne and lowre
               At me and other, whom the king promoted
               To dignityes: wherin he madly doted.
            
            
               
               For ſeeinge we were his dere allied frendes,
               Our furderaunce ſhould rather haue made him glad
               Than Enmy like to wyſhe our wofull endes.
               VVee were the neareſt Kinſfolke that he had.
               VVee ioyed with him his ſorrow made vs ſad:
               But he eſteemed ſo mutch his paynted ſheath
               That he diſdayn'de the loue of all beneath.
            
            
               But ſee how ſharply God reuengeth ſinne:
               As hee maligned mee, and many other
               His faythfull Frendes, and kindeſt of his kin,
               So Richard Duke of Gloceſter, his very Brother,
               Maligned him, and beaſtly did him Smouther.
               A Deuiliſh deede, a moſt vnkindly part,
               Yet iuſt reuenge for his vnnaturall hart.
            
            
               Although this Brother Queller, Tyrant fell
               Enuied our State, as mutch, and more than he:
               Yet did his cloakinge Flattery ſo excell
               To all our Frendes ward, chiefly vnto me,
               That he appeard, our truſty ſtay to bee:
               For outwardly he wrought, our State to furder,
               VVhere inwardly he minde nought ſaue murder.
            
            
               Thus in appearaunce who but I was bleſt?
               The chiefeſt honours heaped on my head:
               Beloued of all, enioying quiet reſt,
               The froward Prince by me alone was led,
               A Noble Impe, to all good vertues bred:
               The Kinge my Liege without my counſayle knowne,
               Agreed nought: though wiſeſt were his owne.
            
            
               
               But quiet bliſſe in no ſtate laſteth longe
               Aſſayled ſtill by miſchiefe many wayes:
               Whoſe ſpoylinge battry glowinge hote, and ſtronge,
               No flowinge wealth, no force nor Wiſedome ſtaies
               Her ſmoakeleſſe Poulder beaten Souldiers ſtaies.
               By open force, foule miſchiefe oft preuayls,
               By ſecert ſleight, ſhe ſeeld her purpoſe fayls.
            
            
               The Kinge was bent to mutch to fooliſh pleaſure,
               In banquetinge he had ſo great delight:
               This made him grow in groſneſſe out of meaſure,
               Which, as it kindleth carnall appetite,
               So quencheth it the liuelyneſſe of the ſpirite.
               Whereof enſue ſutch Sickneſſe, and diſeaſes
               As none can cure ſaue death that all diſpleaſes.
            
            
               Through this fault furdered by his Brothers fraud
               (Now God forgeue mee if I Iudge amiſſe)
               Or through that beaſt his ribald or his Baud
               That larded ſtill theſe ſinfull luſts of his,
               He ſodaynly forſooke all worldly bliſſe.
               That loathed leach, that neuer welcome death,
               Through Spaſmous humours ſtopped vp his breath.
            
            
               That tyme lay I at Ludloe, Wales his border,
               For with the Prince the Kinge had ſent me thyther
               To ſtay the Robberies, Spoyle, and foule diſorder,
               Of diuers Outlawes gathered there together:
               Whole bandinge tend
                     •
                  d no man wiſt well whither
               VVhan theſe by wiſdome ſafly were ſuppreſſed,
               Came woful newes, our Soueraigne was deceaſſed.
            
            
               
               The griefe whereof when reaſon was aſſwaged,
               Becauſe the Prince remayned in my guide,
               For his defence great ſtore of men I waged,
               Doubtinge the ſtormes which at ſutch tyme betide.
               But while I there thus warely did prouide,
               Commaundement came to ſend them home agayne
               And bringe the Kinge thence with his houſhold trayn
                     •
                  .
            
            
               This charge ſent from the Counſayle, and the Queene,
               Though mutch agaynſt my minde I beaſt obayed:
               The deuill himſelfe wrought all the drift I weene,
               Becauſe he would haue Innocentes betrayed:
               For ere the Kinge were halfe his way conueyed,
               A ſort of Traytours falſely him betrapt
               A caught afore, and cloſe in Priſon clapt.
            
            
               The Duke of Gloceſter that incarnate deuill
               Confedred with the Duke of Buckingham,
               With the Lord Haſtings, haſty both to euill
               To meete the Kinge in mourninge habite came,
               (A cruell Wolfe though clothed like a Lambe)
               And at Northampton, where as than I bayted
               They tooke their Inne as they one mee had wayted.
            
            
               The Kinge that night at Stonyſtratford lay,
               A towne to ſmall to harbour all his Trayne:
               This was the cauſe why he was gone away
               VVhile I with other did behinde remayne.
               But will you ſee how falſely frends can fayne?
               Not Sinon ſly, whoſe fraude beſt Fame rebukes,
               VVas halfe ſo ſubtle as theſe double Dukes.
            
            
               
               Firſt to myne Inne, commeth in my brother falſe
               Embraceth mee: well met good Brother Scales,
               And weepes withall: the other me enhalſe
               VVhich welcome Cooſin, now welcome out of Wales
               O happy day, for now all ſtormy gales
               Of ſtrife, and Rancour vtterly are ſwaged,
               And wee our own to liue, or dye vnwaged,
            
            
               This proferd ſeruice, Sauſt wich Salutacions
               Immoderate, might cauſe mee to ſuſpect:
               For commonly in all Diſſimulations
               Th'exces of glaueringe doth the guile derect:
               Reaſon refuſeth falſehoode to dyrect,
               The will therefore for feare of beinge ſpyde,
               Exceedeth meane, becauſe it wanteth guyde.
            
            
               This is the cauſe why ſutch as fayne to weepe
               Do howle outright, or waylinge cry ah,
               Teringe them ſelues, &amp; ſtrayninge Sighes moſt deepe.
               VVhy ſutch Diſſemblers as would ſeeme to laugh

               For commonly all that do counterfayte
               In any thinge, exceede the naturall meane,
               And that for feare of faylinge in their feate.
               But theſe Conſpirers couched all ſo cleane,
               Through cloſe demeanour, that their wiles did weane
               My heart from doubtes, ſo many a falſe deuice
               They forged freſh, to hyde their enterpriſe.

               Our banquet done when they ſhould go their wayes
               They tooke their leaue, oft withinge mee good Night
               As haertely as any Creature might.
            
            
               A noble heart they ſay is Lyon lyke,
               It cannot couche, diſſemble, crouch, nor fayne,
               How Villanous were theſe, and how vnlike?
               Of noble Stocke the moſt Ignoble ſtayne.
               Their Woluiſh hearts. their Trayterous Foxly brayne
               Eyther proue them baſe, of raſcall race engendred
               Or from hault Lynage Baſtardlike degendred.
            
            
               Sutch polling heads as prayſe for prudent pollicy
               Falſe Practiſes. I wiſhe were pact on Poales.
               I meane the Baſtard ſaw broode, which can molify
               All kinde of cauſes in their crafty nolles.
               Theſe vndermine all vertue, blynde as molles,
               They bloſter wronge, they racke, and ſtraiue the right
               And prayſe for Law, both Malice, Fraud, and Might.
            
            
               Theſe quench the worthy Flames of noble kinde,
               Prouokinge beſt borne to the baſeſt vices,
               Through crafts they make the bouldeſt Courage blinde,
               Diſlikinge highly valiant enterpriſes:
               And prayſinge vily, villanous deuices.
               Theſe make the Bore a Hog, the Bull an Oxe,
               The Swan a Gooſe, the Lyon a Wolfe, or Foxe.
            
            
               
               The Lawyer Cateſby and his crafty feers
               A rout that neuer did good in any Realme,
               Are they that had tranſformed theſe noble Peers:
               They turn'de their bloud to melancholicke fleume.
               Their courage hault to cowardiſe extreame
               Their Force, and Manhoode, into Fraud, and Malice,
               Their Wit to wiles: ſtout Hector into Paris.
               
            
            
               Theſe Glauerers gone, my ſelfe to reſt I layde,
               And doubtinge nothinge, ſoundly fell a ſleepe:
               But ſodainly my ſeruants ſore afraide
               A waked me: and drawinge ſighes full deepe,
               Alas (quoth one) my Lord we are hetraide.
               How ſo (quoth I) the Dukes are gone their waies,
               They haue barred the Gates, and borne away the Keyes.
            
            
               VVhile he thus ſpake, there came into my mynde
               This fearefull dreame, whereout I waked was:
               I ſawe a Riuer ſtopt with ſtormes of winde
               VVhere through a Swan, a Bull, &amp; Bore did paſſe.
               Fraunchinge the fiſh, and fry, with teath of braſſe,
               The Riuer dried vp ſaue a litle ſtreame
               VVhich at the laſt did water all the Realme.
            
            
               Me thought this ſtreame did drowne the cruell Bore,
               In little ſpace, it grew ſo deepe, and brode:
               But he had kil'de the Bull, and Swan before.
               Beſides all this I ſawe an oughly Tode
               Crall toward me, on which me thought I trode:
               But what became of her, or what of me
               My ſodayne wakinge would not let me ſee.
            
            
               
               Theſe dreames conſidered with this ſodayne newes
               So diuers from their doings ouer night,
               Did cauſe me not a litle for to muſe,
               I bleſt me, and ryſe in all the haſt I might,
               By this, Aurora ſpred abroade the light.
               Which fro the endes of Phoebus beams ſhe tooke
               Who than the Bulls chiefe Gallery forſooke.
            
            
               VVhen I had opened the window to looke out
               There might I ſee the ſtreates ech where beſet,
               My Inne on ech ſide compaſſed about
               With armed watchmen, all eſcapes to let
               Thus had theſe Neroes caught me in their Net.
               But to what ende, I could not throughly geſſe,
               Sutch was my playnneſſe, ſutch their doubleneſſe.
            
            
               My Conſcience was ſo clere I could not doubt
               Their deadly drift, which leſſe apparant lay,
               Becauſe they cauſ'de their men retourne the rout
               That yode toward Stoniſtratford as they ſay,
               Becauſe the Dukes will firſt be there to day:
               For this (thought I) they hinder me in ieaſt,
               For guiltleſſe mindes do eaſely deeme the beſt.
            
            
               By this the Dukes were come into mine Inne
               For they were lodged in another by,
               I got me to them thinking it a ſinne
               VVithin my Chamber cowardly to lye.
               And merely I aſked my brother why
               He vſed me ſo? he ſterne in euill ſadneſſe
               Cried out: I arreſt the Traytour for thy badneſſe,
            
            
               
               How ſo (quoth I) whence riſeth your ſuſpition?
               Thou art a Traitour (quoth he) I the arreſt
               Arreſt (quoth I) why? where is your Commiſſion?
               He drew his Weapon, ſo did all the reſt
               Cryinge: yelde thee Traytour. I ſo ſore diſtreſt
               Made no reſiſtaunce: but was ſent to warde:
               None ſaue their ſeruauntes aſſigned to my garde.
            
            
               This done they ſped them to the Kinge in poſte,
               And after their humble reuerence to him done,
               They traiterouſly began to rule the roſte,
               They picked a quarel to my ſiſter ſonne
               Lord Richard Gray: the Kinge would not be wonne
               To agree to them, yet they agaynſt all reaſon,
               Arreſted him they ſayd for haynous Treaſon.
            
            
               Sir Thomas Vaughan, and Sir Richard Haule
               Two worthy Knightes were likewiſe apprehended,
               Theſe all were guilty in one kinde of fault,
               They would not like the practiſe then pretended:
               And ſeeinge the Kinge was herewith ſore offended,
               Backe to Northampton they brought him agayne
               And thence diſcharged moſt part of his Trayne.
            
            
               There lo! Duke Richard made himſelfe Protector
               Of Kinge, and Realme by open Proclamation,
               Though neyther Kinge nor Queene were his Elector,
               Thus he preſumed by lawleſſe vſurpation.
               But will you ſee his deepe diſſimulation?
               Hee ſent me a diſh of Deinties from his Borde
               That day, and with it this falſe frendly word.
            
            
               
               Commend me to him all things ſhalbe well,
               I am his frend, bid him be of good cheare:
               Theſe newes I prayed the Meſſenger go tell
               My Nephue Richard, whom I loued full deare.
               But what he ment by well, now ſhall you heare:
               He thought it well to haue vs quickly murdered,
               Which not longe after thorowly he furdered.
            
            
               For ſtrait from thence we cloſely were conuayed
               From Iayle to Iayle Northward we wiſt not whither:
               Where after we had a while in ſunder ſtrayed,
               At laſt we met at Pomfret all together.
               Syr Richard Ratcliffe had vs welbome thyther,
               Who openly, all law, and right contemned
               Beheaded vs before we were condemned.
            
            
               My Cooſin Richard could not be content
               To leaue his life, becauſe he wiſt not why.
               Good Gentleman that neuer harme had ment,
               Therefore hee aſked wherefore hee ſhould dye:
               The Prieſt his ghoſtly Father did replye
               With weepinge eyes: I know one wofull cauſe,
               The Realme hath neyther righteous Lordes, nor lawes.
            
            
               Sir Thomas Vaughan chaſinge cryed ſtill:
               This Tyraunt Gloceſter is the graceleſſe G.
               That will his Brothers Children beaſtly kill.
               And leaſt the people through his talke might ſee
               The miſchiefs toward, and thereto not agree
               Our Tormentour that falſe periured Knight
               Bad ſtop our mouthes, with wordes of high diſpight.
            
            
               
               Thus dyed we guiltleſſe proceſſe heard we none,
               No cauſe alleagde, no Iudge, nor yet accuſer,
               No queſt empaneld paſſed vs vppon.
               That murdrer Ratcliffe, Law, and Rights refuſer,
               Did all to flatter Richard his abuſer.
               Vnhappy both that euer they were borne,
               Through guiltleſſe bloud that haue their ſoules forlorne.
            
            
               In part I graunt, I well deſerued this,
               Becauſe I cauſed not ſpeedy execution
               Be done on Richard for that murder of his,
               VVhen firſt he wrought Kinge Henries cloſe confuſion.
               Not for his Brothers hatefull perſecution.
               Theſe cruell murders paynefull death deſerued
               VVhich had be ſuffred, many had bin preſerued.
            
            
               VVarne therefore all that charge, or office beare
               To ſee all murdrers ſpeedely executed:
               And ſpare them not for fauour or for feare:
               By guiltleſſe bloud the earth remaynes polluted.
               For lacke of Iuſtice kingdomes are tranſmuted.
               They that ſaue murdrers from deſerued payne,
               Shall through thoſe murdrers, miſerably be ſlayne.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            
               WHā I had read this, they liked it very wel,
one wiſhed yt the combat which hee fought
with the Baſtard of Burgoyne, and the
Honour which he wan wt both ſpeare &amp; Axe ſhould
not be forgotten. Another moued a queſtion about
a great matter, and yt is the variaunce of the Chronicles
about the Lord Thomas Graye Marquiſe
Dorcet: whō Fabian euery wher calleth ye queenes
brother: ſir Thomas Moore and Hal, call him the
Queenes ſonne as hee was in very deede. Fabian
ſaith he was gouernour of yt Prince, and had ye conueiaunce
of him frō Ludlo towards Londō. The
other (whom we follow) ſay he was than at London
wt the Queene prouiding for the kinges coronation,
and toke Sanctuary with her as ſone as hee
heard of the apprehending of his vncle. This diſagreing
of wryters is a great hindraunce of ye truth,
and no ſmal combraunce to ſuch as be diligent readers,
beſides the harme that may happen in ſucceſſion
of heritages. It were therefore a worthye and
good deede for the nobility, to cauſe all the recordes
to be ſought, and a true and perfect Chronicle there
out to be written Vnto which we refer ye deciding
of this &amp; of all other like controuerſies, geuinge this
to vnderſtand in the meane time, that no man ſhall
thincke his title eyther better or worſe by any thing
that is written in any part of this treatiſe. For the
onely thing which is purpoſed herein, is by example
of others miſeries, to diſſwade al men frō al ſinnes

and vices. If by the way we touch any thinge concerninge
titles, we follow therein Halles Chronicle.
And were wee ſeeme to ſwarue from hys reaſons
and cauſes of diuers doinges, there wee gather vppon
cōiecture ſutch things as ſeeme moſt probable,
or at the leaſt moſt conuenient for the furderaunce
of our purpoſe. Whan the reader would haue proceeded
in the Chronicle which ſtraighte intreateth
of the villanous deſtruction of the Lord Haſtings,
I willed him to ſurceas, becauſe I had there hys
Tragedy very learnedly penned. For the better vnderſtandinge
whereof, you muſt imagine yt you ſee

               Lo! none I hurt but furdred euery man.
               My Chamber England was, my ſtaffe the law:
               VVhere by ſaunce rigour, all I held in awe.
               So louinge to all, ſo beloued of all,
               As, (what enſued vpon my bloudy fall
               Though I ne felt) yet ſurely this I thincke.
               Full many a tricklinge teare their mouths did drincke.

               Of God himſelfe: to maſſy a charge for ſprits.
               But then, my Lords, conſider, he delights
               To vayle his grace to vs poore earthly wants,
               To ſimpleſt Shrubs, and to the Dunghill plants.
               Expreſſe him then, in might ,and mercies meane.
               So ſhall yee winne, as now yee rule the realme.
            
            
               But all to longe I feare do delaye
               The many meanes, whereby I did be wray
               My Zealous will, to earne my Princes grace.

               Now farewel Baldwin, ſhield my torne name,

               Thus ended Haſtinges both his life and tale,
               Contayning al his worldly bliſſe and bale.
               Happye he liued, to happie but for ſinne,
               Happie hee dyed whom right his death did bring.
               Thus euer happie. For there is no meane
               Twixt bliſſeful liues and mortal deathes extreame.
               Yet feared not his foes to ſtaine his name.
               And by theſe ſclaunders to procure his ſhame.

               Which was ſo curious, and ſo clerkely pend,
               So long withal: that when ſome did attend
               His death ſo young: they ſaw that long before
               The ſhroude was ſhaped, then babe to dye was bore.
               So wonteth God to blinde the worldly wiſe,
               That not to ſee, that al the world eſpies.
            
            
               One hearing it cried out. A goodly caſt,
               And wel contriued, fowle caſt away for haſt.
               Whereto another gan in ſcoffe replie,
               Firſt pend it was by enſpiring prophecie.
               So can God reape vp ſecret miſchiefes wrought,
               To the confuſion of the workers thought.
               My Lords, the tub, that dround the Clarence Duke,
               Dround not his death, nor yet his deathes rebuke.

               WHen I had read this, one ſayd the admonition
geuen in the hiſtory was profitable
for the auoyding of the vices conteyned in

the reader: The next here whome I fynde miſerable,
are king Edwardes two ſonnes, cruelly murdred
in the Tower of London: Haue you theyr tragedy?
No ſurely (ſaide I) The Lord Vaulx vndertoke
to penne it, but what hee hath done therein I am
not certayne, &amp; therfore I let it paſſe, til I knowe

            I haue heare the Duke of Buckingham, kinge Richards

with a good wil (quoth I) But firſt you ſhal heare
his preface or induction. Hath hee made a preface
(ſaide one) what meaneth he therby, ſeing none other
hath vſed the like order? I wil tel you the cauſe
thereof (ſaide I) which is this: After that hee vnderſtoode
that ſome of the counſail would not ſuffer
the booke to be printed in ſuche order as we had
agreed and determined, he purpoſed to haue gotten
at my hands, all the tragedies that were before the
Duke of Buckinghams, which he would haue preſerued
in one volume. And from y• time backwarde
euen to the time of William the Conquerour, hee
determined to continue and perfecte all the ſtorye

himſelfe, in ſuch order as Lydgate (folowing Bochas
had already vſed. And therefore to make a
meete Induction into the matter, hee deuiſed this
po
                  •
               ſie: which in my iudgement is ſo well penned,
that I woulde not haue anye Verſe thereof, left
out of our volume. Nowe that you knowe
the cauſe and meaning of his doing, you
ſhall heare alſo what hee hath done
His Induction beginneth
thus.

               Hawthorne had loſt his motley lyuerye,

               Ech thing (me thought) with weeping eye me told
               The cruel ſeaſon, bidding me withhold
               My ſelfe within for I was gotten out
               Into the fieldes whereas I walkt about.
            
            
               When lo the night with miſtie mantles ſpred
               Gan darke the day, and dim the azure ſkies,

               And Virgo hyding her diſdainful breſt

               And ſorrowing I to ſee the Sommer flowers,

               The Sommers beautie yeldes to winters blaſt.
            
            
               Then looking vpward to the heauens leames
               With nights ſtars thicke powdred euery where,

               And ſtrait foorth ſtalking with redoubled pace
               For that I ſaw the night drew on ſo faſt,
               In blacke al clad there fel before my face
               A piteous might, whom wo had al forewaſt,
               Forth on her eyes the chriſtal teares foorth braſt.
               And ſighing ſore her handes ſhe wrong and fold,
               Tare al her hayre, that ruth was to behold.
            
            
               Her body ſmal forewichred and foreſpent,
               As is the ſtalke that Sommers drought oppreſt,

               In woe and plaint repoſed was her reſt.
               And as the ſtone that drops of water weares,
               So dented were her cheekes with fall of teareſſ.
            
            
               Her eyes ſwollen with flowing ſtreames a flote,

               And with that word of ſorow al forfaint

               Fel downe, and all to baſht her ſelfe for wo.
               The cold pale dread my lims gan ouer goe,
               And I ſo ſorowed at her ſorowes eft,
               That what with griefe and feare my wits were reft.

               And rearing her with anguiſh al foredone,
               My ſpirites returnde▪ and then I thus begone.
            
            
               O Sorow alas ſith ſorow is thy name,
               And that to thee this dreere doth wel pertaine.
               In vayne it were to ſeeke to ceaſe the ſame:
               But as a man himſelfe with ſorow ſlaine,
               So I alas do comfort thee in payne,

               I had no ſooner ſpoken of a ſtike
               But that the ſtorme ſo rumbled in her breaſt,
               As E

                     lus could neuer roare the like,
               And ſhowers downe rayned from her eyes ſo faſt.
               That al bedreint the place, til at the laſt
               VVell eaſed they the dolour of her minde.
               As rage of rayne doth ſwage the ſtormie winde.
            
            
               For forth ſhe paced in her feareful tale:
               Come, come, (quoth ſhee) and ſee what I ſhall ſhowe,
               Come heare the playning and the bitter bale
               Of worthy men, by Fortune ouerthrow.
               Come thou and ſee them rewing al in rowe.
               They were but ſhades that earſt in mynde thou rold.
               Come, come with me, thyne eyes ſhal them behold.
            
            
               
               What could theſe wordes but make me more agaſt?
               To heare her tel whereon I muſde while ere,
               So was I mazde therewith: til at the laſt,
               Muſing vpon her wordes, and what they were,
               Al ſodenlye wel leſſened was my feare:
               For to my minde retourned how ſhe teld
               Both what ſhe was, and where her won ſhe held.
            
            
               Whereby I knew that ſhee a Goddeſſe was,
               And therewithal reſorted to my minde
               My thought, that late preſented me the glas
               Of brittle ſtate, of cares that here we finde.
               Of thouſand woes, to ſeely men aſſinde:
               And how ſhe now bid me come and beholde
               To ſee with eye that earſt in thought I rolde.
            
            
               Flat downe I fel, and with al reuerence
               Adored her, perceiuing now that ſhee
               A Goddeſſe ſent by godlye prouidence,
               In earthly ſhape thus ſhowd her ſelfe to me,
               To wayle and rue this worlds certaintye:
               And while I honourd thus her Godheads might,
               With playning voyce theſe wordes to me ſhe ſhright
            
            
               I ſhal the guide firſt to the grieſlye lake,
               And thence vnto the bliſful place of reſt.
               Where thou ſhalt ſee and heare ye plaint they make.
               That whilom here bare ſwinge among the beſt.
               This ſhalt thou ſee, but great is the vnreſt
               That thou muſt byde before thou canſt attaine
               Vnto the dreadful place where theſe remaine.
            
            
               
               And with theſe wordes as I vprayſed ſtode,
               And gan to folow her, that ſtraight forth paſte,
               Ere I was ware, into a deſert woode
               We now were come: where hand in hand embraſte,
               She led the way, and through the thicke ſo traſte,
               As but I had bene guided by her might,
               It was no way for any mortal wight.
            
            
               But loe, while thus amid the deſert darke,
               We paſſed on with ſteps and pace vnmeete:
               A rumbling roare confuſde with howle and harke
               Of Dogs, ſhoke al the ground vnder our feete,
               And ſtroke the din within our eares ſo diepe,
               As halfe diſtraught vnto the ground I fel,
               Beſought returne, and not to viſite Hel.
            
            
               But ſhe forthwith vplifting me a pace
               Remoued my dread, and with a ſtedfaſt mynde
               Bid me come on, for here now was the place,
               The place where we our trauaile end ſhould finde.
               Wherewith I roſe, and to the place aſſinde
               Aſtoinde I ſtalke, when ſtraight we approached nere
               The dreadful place, that you wil dread to here.
            
            
               An hydeous hole al vaſte, withouten ſhape,
               Of endleſſe depth, orewhelmde with ragged ſtone,
               With ouglye mouth, and grieſlye iawes doth gape,
               And to our ſight confounds it ſelfe in one.
               Here entred wee, and yeding forth, anone
               An horrible lothly lake we might diſcerne
               As blacke as pitch, that cleped is Auern:
               
            
            
               
               A deadly gulfe where nought but rubbiſh grows,
               With fowle blacke ſwelth in thickned lumps yt lies,
               VVhich vp in thayre ſuch ſtinking vapors throwes
               That ouer there, may flie no foule but dyes,
               Choakt with the peſtlent ſauours that ariſe.
               Hyther we come, whence foorth we ſtil did pace.
               In dreadful feare amid the dreadful place.
            
            
               And firſt within the porch and iawes of Hel
               Sate diepe Remorſe of conſcience, al beſprent
               With teares: And to her ſelfe oft would ſhe tell
               Her wretchedneſſe, and curſing neuer ſtent
               To ſob and ſighe: but euer thus lament,
               VVith thoughtful care, as ſhe that al in vayne
               Would weare and waſt continually in paine.
            
            
               Ier eyes vnſtedfaſt rolling here and there,
               Whurld on ech place, as place yt vengeance brought,
               So was her minde continually in feare,
               Toſſed and tormented with tedious thought
               Of thoſe deteſted crimes which ſhe had wrought:

                  oynd and amazde at his owne ſhade for dread,
               And fearing greater daungers then was neede.
            
            
               
               And next within the entry of this lake
               Sate fell Reuenge gnaſhinge her teeth for ire,
               Deuiſinge meanes how ſhee may vengeaunce take,
               Neuer in reſt till ſhe haue her deſire:
               But frets within ſo farforth with the fier
               Of wreakinge flames, that now determine ſhse,
               To dye by death, or vengde by death to bee.
            
            
               When fell Reuenge with bloudy foule pretence

               With tremblinge Limmes wee ſoftly parted thence,
               Till in our eyes another ſight wee met:
               When fro my hart a ſigh forthwith I fet
               Rewing alas vpon the wofull plight

               His face was leaue, and ſomedeale pyned away,
               And eke his hande conſumed to the bone,
               But what his body was I cannot ſay,
               For on his Carkas rayment had he none
               Saue Clouts, and Patches peeced one by one.
               With ſtaffe in hand, and Scrip on ſhoulder caſt,

               Whoſe wretched ſtate when wee had well beheld
               With tender ruth on him, and on his ſeres,

               And by and by, another ſhape apperes

               Of high renowne, but as a lyuinge death,
               So dead aliue, of life hee drew the breath.

               VVithout reſpect eſteeminge equally

               And next in order ſad Olde age wee founde

               VVith droupinge cheare ſtill poringe on the ground,

               There heard wee him with broke, and hollow playnt

               VVyth ſweete remembraunce of his pleaſures paſt,

               But and the cruell fates ſo fixed bee
               That time forepaſt cannot retourne agayne,
               This one requeſt of Ioue yet prayed hee:
               That in ſutch withred plight, and wretched payne,
               As elde (accompanied with his lothſome trayne)
               Had brought on him, all were it woe, and griefe.
               Hee might a while yet linger forth his lief.
            
            
               And not ſo ſoone deſcend into the pit:
               VVhere death, when hee the mortall corps hath ſlayne,

               But who had ſeene him ſobbinge, how he ſtoode
               Vnto himſelfe, and how he would beemone
               His youth forepaſt, as thought it wrought him good
               To talke of youth, all were his youth foregone,
               He would haue muſed, and maruayled mutch whereon
               This wretched age ſhould life deſire ſo fayne,
               And knowes full well life doth but lenghth his payne.
            
            
               Crokebackt hee was, toothſhaken, and blere Eyed,
               Went on three feete, and ſomtime crept on foure,
               With olde lame Bones, that ratled by his ſyde,

               For briefe the ſhape, and Meſſenger of death.
            
            
               And faſt by him pale malady was plaſte,
               Sore ſicke in Bed, her coulour all foregone,
               Bereft of Stomacke, Sauour, and of Taſte.
               Ne could the Brooke no meate but Broths alone,
               Her Breath corrupt, her Keepers euery one
               Abborringe her, her Sickneſſe paſt recure,
               Deteſtinge Phiſicke, and all Phiſicks Cure.
            
            
               But oh the dolefull ſight that than wee ſee,
               Wee tourn'de our look, and on the other ſide
               A griefly ſhape of Famine mought wee ſee,
               With greedy lookes, and gapinge mouth that cryed,
               And roarde for meate, as ſhe ſhould there haue dyed,
               Her body ruinne, and bare as any Bone,
               Whereto was left nought but the caſe alone.
            
            
               
               And that alas was gnawen on euery where,
               All full of Holes, that I ne mought refraine
               From teares to ſee how ſhee her armes could teare
               And with her teeth gnaſh on the bones in vayne:
               When all for nought ſhee fayne would ſo ſuſtayne
               Her ſtaruen Corps, that rather ſeemde a ſhade,
               Then any ſubſtaunce of a creature made.
            
            
               Great was her force whom Stonewall could not ſtay,
               Her tearinge nayles ſnatchinge at all ſhee ſawe:
               With gapinge Iawes that by ne meanes ymay
               Bee ſatiſfyed from hunger of her Mawe,
               But eates herſelfe as ſhee that hath no Lawe:
               Gnawinge alas her Carkas all in vayne,
               Where you may countech Sinow, Bone, and Vaine.
            
            
               On her while wee thus firmely fixt our Eyes,
               That bled for ruth of ſutch a drery ſight,
               Loe! ſodainly ſhee ſhright in ſo huge wiſe,
               As made Hell gates to ſhiuer with the might.
               VVherewith a Dart wee ſawe how it did light.
               Right on her breſt, and therewithall pale death
               Enthrillinge it to reue her of her breath.
            
            
               And by and by a dumme dead Corps wee ſawe,
               Heauy and cold, the ſhape of death a right,
               That dauntes all earthly creatures to his lawe:
               Agaynſt whoſe Force in vayne it is to fight

               His dart anon out of his corps he toke,
               And in his hand (a dreadful ſight to ſee)
               With great triumphe eftſones the ſame he ſhoke,
               That moſt of al my feares affrayed mee:

               VVyth Vyſage grim, Sterne lookes, and Blackly hewed
               In his right Hand a naked Sword hee had,

               And in his left (that Kinge, and Kingdomes rewed)
               Famine, and Fyer hee helde, and therewithall

               And Ioues vnmoued ſentence and foredoome

               I could not lin, but I muſt there lament.
            
            
               And that the more ſith deſteny was ſo ſterne
               As force perforce, there might no force auayle,
               But ſhee muſt fall: and by her fall wee learne,
               That Citties, Towers, Wealth, World, and all ſhall quayle.
               No Manhoode, Might, nor nothinge mought preuayle,
               All were there Preſt, full many a Prince, and Peere

               Nor worthy Hector worthieſt of them all,
               Her Hope, her Ioy, his Force is now for naught.
               O Troy, Troy, there is no boote but bale,
               The hugy Horſe within thy Wales is brought:
               Thy Turrets fall, thy Knights that whilome fought
               In Arms amid the Field, are ſlayne in Bed,
               Thy Gods defilde, and all thy honour dead.
            
            
               The flames vpriſinge, and cruelly they creepe
               From Wale to Roofe, till all to Cinders waſte,

               Some ruſh in heere, ſome run in there as faſt.
               In euery where, or Sworde, or Fyre they caſte.

                  Caſſandra yet there ſawe I how they baled
               From Pallas Houſe, with ſparcled treſſe vndone,

               And Priam eke in vayne how hee did ronne
               To Arms, whom Pyrrhus with diſpight hath done
               To cruell Death, and Bath'de him in the Bayne
               Of his Sonnes bloud before the Aulter ſlayne.
            
            
               But how can I deſcriue the dolefull ſight,
               That in the ſhield ſo liuely fayre did ſhyne?
               Sith in this world I thinke was neuer wight

               I can no more but tel how there is ſeene
               Faire Ilium fall, in burninge red gledes downe,
               And from the ſoyle great Troy Neptunus Towne.

               That Boyles and Bubs vp ſwelth as blacke as Hell.
               Where griefly Charon at their fixed tyde
               Still ferries Ghoſts vnto the farder ſide.
            
            
               The aged God no ſooner Sorrow ſpied,
               But haſting ſtrait vnto the banke apace
               With hollow call vnto the Rout hee cried,
               To ſwarue apart and geue the Goddeſſe place,
               Strait it was done, when to the ſhoare we pace,
               Where hand in hand as we than linked faſt,
               Within the Boote wee are together plaſte.
            
            
               
               And forth wee launch, full Fraughted to the Brincke,
               Whan with the vnwonted waight, the ruſty Keele
               Began to cracke as if the ſame ſhould ſinke.
               Wee hoyſe vp Maſt and Sayle, that in a while
               Wee fet the ſhore, were ſcarcely wee had while
               For to ariue, but that wee hearde anone
               A three ſound barke confounded all in one.
            
            
               Wee had not longe forth paſt, but that wee ſawe,
               Blacke Cerberus the hideous Hound of Hell,
               VVyth Briſtles reard, and with a three mouthed Iawe,
               Fore dinninge the Ayre with his horrible yelle.
               Out of the deepe darke Caue where hee did dwell,
               The Goddeſſe ſtraite hee knewe, and by and by
               Hee peaſt, and couched, whils that wee paſſed by.
            
            
               Thence come wee to the horrour, and the Hell,
               The large great Kingdomes, and the dreadfull raygne
               Of Pluto in his Trone where hee did dwell,
               The wide waſte places, and the hugy Playne:
               The Waylinges, ſhrikes, and ſundry forces of payne,
               The Sighes, the Sobs, the deepe, and deadly groane,

               Here pewed the Babes, and heere the Maydes Vnwed
               With folded hands their ſory chaunce bewayl'd,
               Here wept the guiltleſſe ſlayne, and Louers dead,

               With Sighes, and Teares, Sobs, Shrikes, and all yfere,

               Wee ſtayed vs ſtrait, and wyth a rufull feare,
               Behelde this heauy ſight, while from mine eyes,
               The vapored teares downe ſtilled here, and there,
               And Sorrow eke in farre more wofull wiſe.
               Tooke on with plaint, vpheauinge to the Skies
               Her wretched hands, that with her cry the Rout

               Loe! here (quoth Sorrowe) Princes of Renowne,
               That whilom late on top of Fortunes wheele

               Recompt the ſame to Kezar, Kinge, and Peere.
            
            
               Then firſt came Henry Duke of Buckingham,
               His Cloake of blacke, al pilde, and quite forworne,
               Wringinge his hands, and Fortune oft doth blame,
               Which of a Duke hath made him now her ſcorne,
               With gaſtly lookes as one in maner lorne,

               My heart ſo molte to ſee his greefe ſo great,
               As feelingly mee thought it dropt away:
               His eyes they whurlde about withouten ſlaye,

               Thriſe hee began to tell his dolefull Tale,
               And thriſe the Sighes did ſwallow vp his Voyce,
               At ech of which hee ſhriked ſo withall
               As though the Heauens riued with the noyſe:
               Till at the laſt recoueringe his Voyce,
               Suppinge the teares that all his breſt beraynde

               Till by his death hee voucht that Quarrell good,
               In which his Sire, and Graundſire ſpilt their bloud.
            
            
               And ſutch was erſt my Fathers cruell chaunce,
               Of Stafford Earle by name that Humfrey hight
               Who euer Preſt did Henryes part Auaunce,
               And neuer ceaſt till at Saynct Albones fight

               But what may boote to ſtay the Siſters three?
               When Atropos perforce will cut the Thred:
               The dolefull day was come when you might ſee
               Northampton Field, with Armed men Oreſpred,
               Where Fate would algates haue my Graundſire dead:
               So ruſhinge forth amids the fierceſt fight,
               Hee liued, and died there in his Maiſters right.
            
            
               
               In place of whom as it befell my lot,

               Enioyinge there but wofully God wot,
               As hee that had a ſlender part to play:
               To teach thereby, in earth no ſtate may ſtay,
               But as our partes abridge or lengtht our age
               So paſſe wee all while others fill the ſtage.
            
            
               For of my ſelfe the drery fate to plaine.

               To compaſſe that which I haue bought ſo deare:
               I bare the ſwinge, I and that wretched wight,
               The Duke of Gloceſter that Richard hight.
            
            
               For when the fates had reft that Royall Prince
               Edward the fourth, chiefe mirrour of that name,
               The Duke, and I faſt ioyned euer ſince,
               In faythfull loue, our ſecret driftes to frame:
               VVhat hee thought beſt, to mee ſo ſeem'de the ſame,

               VVhoſe reſtleſſe minde ſore thirſtinge after rule,
               VVhen that hee ſawe his nephewes both to bene
               Through tender yeares as yet vnfit to rule,
               And rather ruled by their Mothers Kin,
               There ſought hee firſt his miſchiefe to begin,
               To plucke from them their Mothers frends aſſinde,
               For well he wiſt they would withſtand his mynde.
            
            
               
               To follow which hee ran ſo headlonge ſwift,

               That bent thereto with mounts of miſchiefe fraught
               Hee knew their liues would be ſo ſore his let,
               That in their deaths his onely help hee ſet.

               Loe! Marke the fine that did this Prince be fall:
               Marke not this one, but marke the ende of all.

               And in his armes how oft doth he embrace
               His murdred frend: and kiſſing him in vayne,

               And he thereat with heapes of griefe for done.
               Hateth him ſelfe, wiſhing his later daye.
               Now he likewiſe perceiued in like ſtaye,
               As is the wilde beaſt in the deſert bred,
               Both dreading others and himſelfe abred.

               The worthy Prince deemed in his regarde,
               That death for death could be but iuſt rewarde:
            
            
               Yet wee that were ſo drowned in the depth
               Of deepe deſire to drinke the guiltleſſe bloud,

               So wee delighted in the State wee ſtoode,
               Blinded ſo farre in all our blinded Trayne
               That blinde wee ſawe not our deſtruction playne.
            
            
               Wee ſpared none whoſe life could ought for let

               My heart euen bleedes to tell you all and ſome,
               And how Lord Haſtings when hee feared leaſt,
               Diſpiteouſly was murdred, and oppreſt.

               The Nephewes ſtrait depoſ'de were by the Eame.
               And wee aduaunſt to that wee bought full deere,

               Thus hauinge wonne our longe deſired Pray,

               In hope that nowe ſtint was all furder ſtrife.
               Sith hee was Kinge, and I chiefe ſtroke did beare.
               Who ioyed but wee, yet who more cauſe to feare?
            
            
               The guiltleſſe bloud which wee vniuſtly ſhed,
               The Royall Babes deueſted from their Trons,
               And wee like Traytours raigninge in their ſted,
               Theſe heauy Burdens paſſed vs vpon,
               Tormentinge vs ſo by our ſelues alone,
               Mutch like the Felon that purſued by night,
               Starts at ech Buſh, as his Foe were in ſight.

               Now ſtart in Dreames through dread of murdrers knyfe,
               As though euen then reuengement were aſſinde.
               With reſtleſſe thought ſo is the guilty minde
               Turmoylde, and neuer feeleth eaſe, or ſtay,
               But liues in feare of that which followes aye.
            
            
               
               Well gaue that Iudge his dome vpon the death
               Of Titus Glelius that in Bed was ſlayne:
               Whan euery wight the cruell murder leyth
               To his two Sonnes that in his Chamber layne,
               That Iudge that by the proofe perceiueth playne,
               That they were founde faſt ſleepinge in their Bed,
               Hath deem'de them guiltleſſe of this bloud yſhed.
            
            
               He thought it could not be, that they which brake
               The lawes of God and man in ſutch outrage
               Could ſo forthwith themſelues to ſleepe betake:
               He rather thought the horrour, and the rage
               Of ſutch an haynous gilt, could neuer ſwage.
               Nor neuer ſuffer them to ſleepe, or reſt,
               Or dreadles breath one breath out of their breſt.
            
            
               So gnawes the greife of conſcience euermore
               And in the heart it is ſo deepely graue,
               That they may neyther ſleepe nor reſt therefore,
               Ne thinke one thought, but on the dread they haue.
               Still to the death for toſſed with the waue
               Of reſtleſſe woe, in terrour, and diſpeire.
               They leade a life continually in feare.
            
            
               Lyke to the Deare that ſtriken with the Dart,
               With drawes himſelfe into ſome ſecrete place,
               And feelinge greene the wounde about his hart,
               Startleſſe with pangs till hee fall on the graſſe,
               And in great feare lies gaſpinge there a ſpace,
               Forth brayinge Sigbes as though ech pange had brought
               The preſent death which hee doth dread ſo oft:
            
            
               
               So wee diepe wovnded with the bloudy thought,
               And gnawing worme that grieued our conſciens ſo,
               Neuer tooke eaſe, but as our hart outhrought
               The ſtayned ſighes in witneſſe of our woe,
               Such reſtleſſe cares our fault did wel beknowe:
               Wherewith of our deſerued fal the feares
               In euery place rang death within our eares.
            
            
               And as il grayne is neuer wel ykept,
               So fared it by vs within a while:
               That which ſo long with ſuch vnreſt we reapt,
               In dread and daunger by al wit and wyle,
               Loe ſee the fyne, when once it felt the wheele
               Of ſ
                     •
                  ipper fortune, ſtay it mought no ſtowne,
               The wheele whurls vp, but ſtrait it whurleth down.
            
            
               For hauing rule and riches in our hand,
               Who durſt gainſay the thing that we auerde?
               Will was wiſedome, our luſt for lawe did ſtand,
               In ſort ſo ſtraunge that who was not afeard
               When he the ſound but of king Richard heard?
               So hateful waxt the hearing of his name
               That you may deeme the reſidue of the ſame.
            
            
               But what auaild the terrour and the feare,
               Wherewith he kept his lieges vnder awe?
               It rather wan him hatred euery where.
               And fayned faces forſt by feare of lawe:
               That but while Fortune doth with fauour blaw
               Flatter through feare: for in their harte lurkes aye
               A ſecrete hate that hopeth for a daye.
            
            
               
               Recordeth Dionyſius the Kynge,
               That with his Rigour ſo his Realme oppreſt,
               As that he thought by cruel feare to bringe
               His Subiects vnder, as him liked beſt:
               But loe! the dread where with himſelfe was ſtreſt,
               And you ſhall ſee the fine of forced feare,
               Moſt myrrour like in this proude Prince appeare.
            
            
               All were his Head with Crowne of Golde yſprad,
               And in his Hand the Royall Scepter ſet:
               And hee with Princely Purple richly clad,
               Yet was his heart with wretched cares orefret:
               And in wardly with deadly feare beſet,
               Of thoſe whom hee by Rigour kept in awe,
               And ſore oppreſt with might of Tyraunts Lawe.
            
            
               Agaynſt whoſe feare, no heapes of Golde, and glie,
               No ſtrength of gard, nor all his hired power,
               Ne proude high Towers that preaced to the Skie,
               His cruell heart of ſafty could aſſure:
               But dreadinge them whom hee ſhould deeme moſt ſure,
               Himſelfe his Beard with burninge Brand would ceare,
               Of death deſeru'de ſo vexed him the feare.
            
            
               This might ſuffiſe to repreſent the fine
               Of Tyraunts force, their feares, and their vnreſt,
               But heare this one, although my heart repine
               To let the ſound once ſincke within my breſt:
               Of fell Phereus, that aboue the reſt,
               Sutch lothſome cruelty on his people wrought▪
               
               As (oh alas) I tremble with the thought.
            
            
               
               Some hee encaſed in the Coates of Bears,
               Amonge Wilde beaſts deuoured ſo to bee:
               And ſome for Pray vnto the Hunters Speares,
               Like Sauage Beaſts withouten ruth to dye.
               Sometime to encreaſe his horrible cruelty,
               The quicke with face to face engraued hee,
               Ech others death that ech mought liuinge ſee.
            
            
               Loe! what more cruell horrour mought bee found,
               To purchaſe feare, if feare could ſtay his raygne?
               It

                  ooted not, it rather ſtrake the wounde
               Of feare in him to feare the like agayne.
               And ſo he did full oft, and not in vayne:
               And in his life his cares could witneſſe well▪
               
               But moſt of all his wretched ende doth tell.
            
            
               His owne deare Wyfe whom as his life hee loued,
               Hee durſt not truſt, nor proch vnto her Bed,
               But cauſinge firſt his Slaue with naked Sworde
               To go before, himſelfe with tremblinge dread
               Strayt followeth faſt, and whurlinge in his head
               His rollinge eyen, hee ſearcheth heere, and there
               The deepe daunger that hee ſo ſore did feare.
            
            
               For not in vayne it ran ſtill in his Breaſt,
               Some wretched hap ſhould hale him to his ende.
               And therefore alway by his pillow preſt
               Had hee a Sword, and with that Sword bee wende,
               In vayne (God wote) all perils to defende.
               For loe! his Wife foreyrked of his Raygne,

               The cruell Rout? or of their wretched fall?
               I can no more, but in my name aduert
               All earthly powers beware of Tyrants heart.

               And there as cloſe and couert as I might,

               But too much truſting brought me to my bane.
            
            
               
               For while I now had Fortune at my becke

               Vnwares alas leaſt looking for a checke,
               She mated me in tourning of a ball:
               When leaſt I feared, the neareſt was my fall.

               I had vpraiſde a mighty hand of men,
               And marched foorth in order of array.
               Leading my power amid the foreſt Dene,
               Againſt the tyraunt banner to diſplaye:
               But lo my Souldiers cowardly ſhranke awaye,
               For ſuch is Fortune when ſhe liſt to frowne,
               Who ſeemes moſt ſure, him ſoneſt whurls ſhe down

               Nor hope in faith of giddie peoples minde,
               But let al noble men take heede by mee,

               Lo, where is truth or truſt? or what could binde
               The vayne people, but they wil ſwerue and ſwaye,

               The ſtate of Rome, that dyinge he did fynde,
               Of his owne ſtate is now alas depriued,

               And fortune eke her mutabilitie.

               What more vnworthye than this his exile?
               More iuſt than this the woful plaint he wrote?
               Or who could ſhew a playner proofe the while,
               Of moſt falſe faith, than they thus forgot
               His great deſertes? that ſo deſerued not?

                  Melciades, O happy hadſt thou bee,
               And well rewarded of thy Country men,
               If in the Field when thou hadſt forſt to flye
               By thy proweſſe, three hundred thouſand men,
               Content they had bin to Exile thee then:
               And not to caſt thee into Priſon ſo,
               Laden with Gyues to ende thy life in woe.
            
            
               Alas how hard, and Steely hearts had they
               That not contented there to haue thee dye,
               VVyth fettred Gyues in Priſon where thou lay,
               Increaſt ſo farre in hatefull Cruelty,
               That burial to thy Corps, they eke deny:
               Ne will they graunt the ſame, till thy Sonne haue
               Put on thy Gyues, to purchaſe thee a Graue.
            
            
               Loe! Hanniball as longe as fixed fate,
               And brittle Fortune had ordayned ſo,
               Who euermore aduaunſt his Countrey ſtate
               Then thou that liuedſt for her, and for no moe?
               But when the ſtormy Waues began to growe,
               VVithout reſpect of thy deſerts ere while,
               Art by thy Countrey throwen into Exile.
            
            
               Vnfrendly Fortune ſhall I thee now blame?
               Or ſhall I fault the ſates that ſo ordayne?
               Or art thou Ioue the cauſer of the ſame?
               Or cruelty her ſelfe doth ſhee conſtrayne?
               Or on whom els alas ſhall I complayne?
               O truſtleſſe world I can accuſen none,
               But fickle fayth of Commonty alone.

               Are hot ſo ful of vayne and fickle chaunge
               As is this falſe vnſtedfaſt commontie.
               Loe I alas with mine aduerſitie
               Haue tried it true, for they are fled and gone
               And of an hoaſt, there is not left me one.
            
            
               That I alas in this calamitie
               Alone was left, and to my ſelfe mought plaine
               This treaſon, and this wretched cowardye,
               And eke with teares be weepen and complaine

               Wandring in woe, and to the Gods on hye
               Cleaping for vengeaunce of this treachery.
            
            
               And as the Turtle that hath loſt her mate,
               Whom griping ſorow doth ſo ſore attaint,

               Mourning her loſſe filles al the groue with plaint,

               And being thus alone and al forſake,
               Amid the chick, forewandred in deſpaire,
               As one diſmaid ne wiſt what way to take,
               Vntil at laſt gan to my minde repayre,
               A man of mine called Humfrey Bauaſtaier:
               Wherewith me feeling much recomforted,
               In hope of ſuccour to his houſe I fled.
            
            
               
               Who beeing one whom erſt I had vp brought
               Eeuen from his youth aud loued and liked beſt,
               To gentry ſtate aduauncing him from nought,
               And had in ſecret truſt aboue the reſt.
               Of ſpecial truſt now beeing thus diſtreſt
               Ful ſecretely to him I me conueyed
               Not doubting there but I ſhould fynde ſome ayde,

               When that this caytife once an inkling hard,
               How that King Richard had proclaimde that hee
               Which me deſcried ſhould haue for his rewarde

               His truth ſo turnde to treaſon, al diſtainde
               That fayth quite fled, and I by truſt was trainde.
            
            
               For by this wretch I beeing ſtrait betraied,
               To one Iohn Mitton ſhyriffe of Shropſhire then,
               Al ſodenlye was taken and couayed
               To Saliſburie, with rout of harneſt men,
               Vnto King Richard there encamped then:
               Faſt by the cittie with a mighty hoaſt
               Withouten dome where head and life I loſt:
            
            
               And with theſe wordes as if the axe euen there
               Diſmembred had his head and corps apart,
               Dead fel he downe and wee in woful feare
               Stoode mazed when he would to life reuert:
               But deadly griefe ſtil grew about his hart,

               And with a ſighe becomming dead againe,
            
            
               
               Midnight was come, when euery vital thing
               With ſweete ſound ſleepe their weary lims did reſt,

               The waters calme, the cruel ſeas did ceaſe,
               The woods, the fieldes, &amp; al thinges held their peace
            
            
               The golden ſtars were whirld amid their race,
               And on the earth old laugh with twinckling light,
               When ech thing neſtled in his reſting place,
               Forgat dayes payne with pleaſure of the night:
               The hare had not the greedy boundes in ſight,
               The fearful Deare of death ſtoode not in doubt,
               The Partridge drept not of the Falcons foote.
            
            
               The ouglye Beare now minded not the ſtake,
               Nor how the cruel maſtiues do him teare,
               The ſtag lay ſtil vnrouſed from the brake,
               The fomye bore fearde not the hunters ſpeate:
               Al thing was ſtil in deſert buſh and breare.
               With quiet hart now from their trauayles reſt.
               Soundly they ſlept in midſt of al their reſt.

               So twitching were the panges that he aſſaied,
               And he ſo ſore with ruful rage diſtraught.
               To thinke vpon the wretch that him betraied

               With bloud red eyen he ſtareth here and there,
               Frothing at mouth, with face as pale as clout:

               As halfe a foote, that ſuch hard loſſe of lyfe,
               So cruelly chaunſt, may be the greater griefe.

               This pray I Ioue, and with this later breath,
               Vengeaunce I aſke vpon my cruel death.
            
            
               
               This ſayd he flong his rechles armes abroade,
               And groueling flat vpon the ground he lay,
               Which with his teeth he al to gnaſht and gnawde:
               Deepe groanes he fet, as he that would away,
               But loe in vayne he did the death aſſaye:
               Although I thinke was neuer man that knew,
               Such deadly paynes, where death did not enſue.
            
            
               So ſtroue he thus awhile as with the death,
               Now pale as lead and cold as any ſtone.
               Now ſtil as calme, now ſtorming forth a breath.
               Of ſmoakie ſighes, as breath and al were gone:
               But euery thing hath end: ſo he anone
               Came to himſelfe when with a ſigh outbrayed,
               With woful cheare, theſe woful wordes he ſayd.
            
            
               Ah, where am I, what thing, or whence is this?
               Who reft my wits? or how do I thus lye?
               My lims do quake, my thought agaſted is,
               Why ſigh I ſo? or whereunto do I
               Thus grawle on the ground? and by and by
               Vpraiſde he ſtoode, and with a ſighe hath ſtaide,
               When to himſelfe returned thus he ſayde.
            
            
               Suffiſeth now this plaint and this regreete,
               Whereof my hart his boccome hath vnfraught:
               And of my death let Pieres and princes weete
               The Worlds vntruſt, that they there by be taught.
               And in her wealth, ſith that ſuch chaunge is wrought,
               Hope not too much, but in the midſt of al
               Thinke on my death, and what may them befall.
            
            
               
               So long as Fortune would permit the ſame,
               I liued in rule and riches with the beſt:
               And paſt my time in honour and in fame.
               That of Miſhap no feare was in my breaſt:
               But falſe Fortune when I ſuſpected leaſt,
               Did tourne the wheele, and wich a doleful fall
               Hath me bereft of honour life and all.
            
            
               Loe what auayles in ryches flouds that flowes?

               Euen kinges and Keſars biden Fortunes throwes,
               And ſimple ſore muſt beare it as it is.
               Take heede by me that blithde in baleful bliſſe:
               My rule, my ryches, royal bloud and al,
               When Fortune fround, the feller made my fall.

               To ſwing the ſway in Court among the reſt,
               Dame Fortune me her rule moſt largely lent:
               And kinde courage ſo my corps had blent,
               That loe on whom but me did ſhe moſt ſmyle?
               And whom but me loe, did ſhe moſt beguile?
            
            
               
               Now haſt thou hard the whole of my miſhap
               My chaunce, my chaunge, the cauſe of al my care:

               Bid kinges, bid Keſars, did al ſtates beware,
               And tel them this from mee that tryed it true.

               HOw like you this my maiſters (quoth I)
very wel ſayd one: the tragedy excelleth: ye
inuention alſo of the Induction, and yt deſcriptions,
are notable. But whereas he fayneth to
talke with the Princes in Hel, that I am ſure wyl
be miſliked, becauſe it is moſt certaine, that ſome of
their ſoules be in heauen. And although he herein,
do folow allowed Poets, in their deſcription of hel,
yet it ſauoreth ſo much of Purgatorie, whiche the
Papiſtes haue digged thereout, that the ignoraunt
may thereby bee deceiued. Not a whit I warrant
you ſayd one: for hee meaneth not by his hel y• place
either of damned ſoules, or of ſuche as lye for their
fees, but rather the graue, wherin ye dead bodies of
al ſortes of people do reſt til time of the reſurrectiō.
And in this ſence is Hell taken often in the Scriptures,
and in the writinges of learned Chriſtians, &amp;
ſo wold haue it taken. Tuſh (quoth another) what
ſtand we hereupon? it is a Poeſy and no deuinitye,

and it is lawful for Poetes to fayne what they lyſt

it paſſe euen in ſuch ſort as you haue read it. Wyth
a good wil (quoth I) But whereas you ſay a Poet
may ſayne what he liſt: in dede me thinke it ſhould
be ſo, &amp; ought to be wel taken of the hearers: But
it hath not at al times bene ſo allowed: ye ſay troth
quoth the Reader: For here foloweth in the ſtorye
that after the death of this duke, one called Colling
bourne, was cruellye put to death for makinge of a

               They racke the wordes til time their ſinowes burſt,
               In doubtful ſences, ſtrayning ſtil the worſt.
            
            
               
               A painful proofe taught me the truth of this,
               Through tyrauntes rage, and Fortunes cruel tourne:
               They murdred me, for meetring thinges amiſſe.
               For wotſt thou what? I am that Colling bourne
               Which made the ryme, whereof I wel may mourne.
               The Cat, the Rat, and Louel our Dog,
               Do rule al England vnder a Hog,
            
            
               Whereof the meaning was ſo plaine and true,
               That euery foole perceiued it at furſt:
               Moſt liked it, for moſt that moſt thinges knewe,
               In hugger mugger, muttred what they durſt.
               The tyraunt prince of moſt was held accurſt,
               Both for his owne and for his counſels faultes,
               Of whom was three the naughtieſt of al naughts.
            
            
               Cateſbye was one whome I called a Cat,
               A craftie lawyer catching all be could.
               The ſecond Ratcliffe, whom I named a Rat,
               A cruel beaſt to gnaw on whom

               Lord Louel barckt and bye whom Richard would,
               Whom I therfore did rightly terme our Dog,
               Wherewith to ryme, I cald the king a Hog.
            
            
               Til he the crowne had caught he gaue the Bore,
               In which eſtate would God he had deceaſed,
               Then had the realme not ruined ſo ſore.
               His Nephues raigne ſhould not ſo ſone haue ceaſſed,
               The noble bloud had not bene ſo decreaſed.
               His Rat, his Cat, and Bloudhound had not noyed
               Such liegemen true, as after they deſtroyed.
            
            
               
               Their lawleſſe actes, good ſubiectes did lament,
               And ſo did I, and therfore made the rimes
               To ſhow my wit how wel I could inuent,
               To warne withal the careleſſe of their crimes,
               I thought the freedome of the auncient times
               Stoode ſtil in force. Ridentem dicere verum
               
               Quis veta

                  ? Nay nay, Veritas eſt peſſimarerum.
            
            
               Belike no tyrauntes were in Horace dayes,
               And therefore Poets freely blamed vice,
               VVitneſſe their Satyres ſharpe, and tragicke plaies,
               VVith chiefeſt Princes chieflye had in price.
               They name no man they mixe their gall with ſpice,
               No more doe I▪ I name no man out right,
               But riddle wiſe, I meane them as I might.
            
            
               VVhen brute had brought this to their guiltie eares,
               VVhoſe right ſurnames were noted in the ryme,
               They al conſpyred like moſt greedy

               To charge me ſtraight with this moſt greuous crime:
               And dampned me the Galow tree to clime,
               And then ſtrangled, in quarters to be cut,
               VVhich ſhoud on high ouer London Gates be put.
            
            
               This iudgement geeuen ſo vehement and ſo ſore
               Made me exclaime againſt their tyrannye.
               VVhere with encenſt, to make my payne the more,
               They practiſed a ſhameful vylanie:
               They cut me downe aliue and cruelly,
               Ript vp my paunch and bulke to make me ſmart,
               And lingered long ere they tooke out my hart.
            
            
               
               Here tyraunt Richard plaied the eager Hog,
               His graſhing tuſkes my tender griſtles ſhore:
               His bloud bound Louel playde the rauening Dog,
               His muluiſh teeth, my guiltleſſe carkaſſe tore:
               His Rat, and Cat, did what they might, and more,

                  cliffe gnawed mee to the hart.
            
            
               If Iewes had kild the iuſteſt king aliue,
               If Turkes had burnt vp Churches, Gods, and al,
               What greater payne could cruel hartes contriue,
               Than that I ſuffred, for this treſpaſſe ſmall?
               I was no Prince nor Pier, but yet my fal
               Is worthy to be thought vpon for this,
               To ſee how cankard tyrantes mallice is.
            
            
               To teach alſo al ſubiecte to take heede
               They meddle not with magiſtrates affaires,
               But pray to God to mend them if they neede:

               And whan they touch that they would wiſh amended,
               To ſauſe them ſo, that ſewe nede be offended.
            
            
               And ſo to mixe their ſharpe rebukes with mirth,
               That they may pearce, not cauſing any paine,
               Saue ſuch as foloweth euerye kindely birth,

               No bit nor reine his tender iawes may twight.

               Like Pegaſus a Poet muſt haue winges,
               To flie to heauen or where him liketh beſt:
               He muſt haue knowledge of eternal thinges,
               Almighty Ioue muſt harbour in his breaſt,
               With worldly cares he may not be oppreſt,
               The winges of wit and ſkil muſt heaue him hier.
               With great delight to ſatiſfye deſier.
            
            
               He muſt alſo be luſtye, free, and ſwift
               To trauail far to view the trades of men.
               Great knowledge often is gotten by the ſhift:
               Thinges that impart he muſt be quicke to pen,
               Reprouing vices ſharpely now and then.
               He muſt be ſwift when touched tyrauntes chafe,
               To gallop thence to keepe his carkas ſafe.
            
            
               If I had wel theſe qualities conſidered,
               Eſpecially that which I touched laſt,
               With ſpeedy flight my feete ſhould haue deliuered
               My feeble bodye from a moſt boyſtrous blaſt,
               They ſhould haue caught me ere I had bene caſt,
               But too much truſt vnto a tyrauntes grace,
               I neuer ſhroake, nor chaunged port or place.
            
            
               I thought the Poets auncient liberties
               For pleas had bene allowed at the barre,
               I had forgot how new found tyrannies
               VVith truth and freedome were at open warre,
               That luſt was lawe, that might did make and mar,
               That among tyrauntes this is, and euer was
               Sic volo, ſic iubeo, ſtet pro ratione voluntas.
            
            
               
               VVhere luſt is lawe it booteth not to pleade,
               No Priuiledge nor liberties auayle.
               But with the learn'de whom Lawe, and Wiſedome leade,
               Although through raſhneſſe Poets 
                     •
                  ap to rayle,
               A plea of dotage may all Quarels quayle:
               Their olde licence their Writinges to expounde,
               Doth quit them clere from faults by Momus found.
            
            
               This freedome olde ought not to be debard
               From any wight that ſpeaketh ought, or writeth.
               The authors meaninge ſhould of right bee herd,
               Hee knoweth beſt to what ende hee enditeth:
               Woros ſometime beare more then the heart behiteth.
               Admit therefore the authors expoſicion,
               If playne for truth: if forſt, for his ſubmiſſion.
            
            
               In caſe of ſclaunder the lawes require no more
               Saue to amende that ſeemed not well ſayde:
               Or to vnſay the ſlaunders ſayd afore,
               And aſke forgeueneſſe for the haſty brayde:
               To Heretickes no grater payne is layde
               Then to recant their errours or retract:
               And worſe than theſe can bee no writers acte.
            
            
               Yes (quoth the Cat) thy raylinge wordes bee treaſon,
               And treaſon is farre worſe then Hereſy.
               Then muſt it follow by this auckwarde reaſon,
               That Kinges bee more than God in maieſty,
               And ſoules be leſſe then bodies in degree.
               For Heretikes both ſoules and God offend,
               Traytours but ſeeke to bring mans life to end.
            
            
               
               I ſpeake not this to abaſe the haynous fault,
               Of trayterous Acts abhorde by God, and man,
               But to make playne their iudgement to bee naught
               That Hereſie for leſſer ſinne do ban,
               I curſe them both as deepe as any can,
               And alway did: yet through my fooliſh rime,
               They ſtayned mee with that moſt hatefull crime.
            
            
               I neuer ment the Kinge, or counſayle harme,
               Vnleſſe to wiſhe them ſafety were offence,
               Agaynſt their power I neuer lifted Arme,
               Neyther Pen, nor Tongue for any ill Pretence.
               The Rime I made, though Rude, was ſound in Sence,
               For they therein whom I ſo fondly named,
               So ruled all that they were fowle defamed.
            
            
               This was no Treaſon but the very troth,
               They ruled all, none could deny the ſame:
               What was the cauſe then, why they were ſo wroth?
               What? is it treaſon in a riminge frame
               To clip, to ſtretch, to adde, or chaunge a name?
               And this reſerued, there is no rime nor reaſon.
               That any craft can clout to ſeeme a treaſon.
            
            
               For where I ment the Kinge by name of Hog,
               I onely alluded to his Badge the Bore:
               To Louels name I added more our Dog,
               Becauſe moſt Dogs haue borne that name of yore:
               Theſe Metaphors I vſe with other more,
               As Cat, and Rat, the halfe names of the reſt,
               To hyde the Sence which they ſo wrongly wreſt.
            
            
               
               I maye you nowe what treaſon finde you heere
               Enough: you rubbed the guil
                     •
                  y on the Gaule,
               Both Sence, and names do note them very neere.
               I graunt that was the chiefe cauſe of my faule,
               Yet can you finde therein no treaſon at all:
               There is no worde agaynſt the Prince, or State,
               No harme to them whom all the Realme did hate.
            
            
               But ſith the guilty alwaies are ſuſpicious,
               And dread the ruine that muſt ſue by reaſon,
               They cannot choſe but count their counſayle vicious
               That note their faults, and therefore call it treaſon:
               All grace, and goodneſſe with the lewde is geaſon.
               This is the cauſe why they good thinges do wreſt
               Where as the good take ill thinges to the beſt.
            
            
               And therefore Baldwin boldly to the good
               Rebuke their fault, ſo ſhalt thou purchaſe thankes
               As for the bad, thou ſhalt but moue their moode,
               Thoughe pleaſauntly thou touch their naughty prankes:
               Warne Poets all, no wiſe to paſſe the bankes
               Of Hellicon, but keepe within the bound:
               So ſhall their Freedome, vnto no harme redound.

            HOW RICHARD PLANtagenet
Duke of Gloceſter, murdered
his Brothers Children vſurpinge the Crowne, and in the.iij.
yeare of his Raygne, was moſt worthely depriued of life, &amp;
Kingdome in Boſworth Playne, by Henry Earle of Richmond,
after called Kinge Henry the ſeuenth,
the.22. of Auguſt. 1485.
            
               
                  WHat heart ſo hard, but doth abhorre to heare
               The rufull raygne of mee the third Richard?
               Kinge vnkindly cald though I y• Crown did weare.
               Who entred by rigour, but right did not regard,
               By tyranny proceedinge in killinge Kinge Edward,
               Fift of that name, right Heyre vnto the Crowne,
               With Richard his Brother, Princes of Renowne,
            
            
               
               Of truſt they were committed vnto my Gouernaunce,
               But truſt turned to treaſon to truly it was tried,
               Both agayuſt Nature, Duety, and Allegiaunce,
               For through my procurement moſt ſhamefully they dyed
               Deſire of a Kingdome forgetteth all Kinred,
               As after by diſcourſe it ſhalbe ſhewed here,
               Howe cruelly theſe Innocents in Priſon murdred were.
            
            
               The Lords, and Commons all with one aſſent,
               Protectour made mee both of Land, and Kinge,
               But I therewith alas was not content:
               For mindinge miſchiefe I ment another thinge,
               Which to confuſion in ſhort time did mee bringe,
               For I deſirous to Rule, and Raigne alone,
               Sought Crowne, and Kingdome, yet title had I none.
            
            
               To all Peeres, and Princes, a Preſident I may bee.
               The like to beware how they do enterpriſe,
               And learne their wretched falles by my Facte to foreſee,
               Which ruful ſtand bewaylinge my chaunce before their eyes,
               As one cleane bereft of all felicities:
               For right through might, I cruelly defaced,
               But might, helped right, and mee agayne diſplaced.
            
            
               Alas that euer Prince ſhould thus his honour ſtayne
               With the bloud of Innocents moſt ſhamefull to bee tolde
               For theeſe two Noble Imps I cauſed to bee ſlayne,
               Of yeares not full ripe as yet to rule, and raygne.
               For which I was abhorred both of yongue, and olde,
               But as the deede was Odious in Sight of God, and man,
               So ſhame, and Deſtruction in the ende I wan.
            
            
               
               Both God, Nature, Duty, Allegiaunce all forgot,
               This vile, and haynous Acte vnnaturally conſpired:
               Which Horrible deede done, alas, alas, God wot
               Sutch Terrours mee tormented, and ſo my Sprites fired,
               As vnto ſurch a murder, and ſhamefull deede required,
               Sutch broyle dayly felt I, breedinge in my breſt,
               Whereby more, and more, increaſed myne vnreſt.
            
            
               My Brothers Children were right Heyres to the Crowne
               VVhom Nature rather bound to defend than deſtroy,
               But I not regardinge their Right, nor my Renowne
               My whole care, and ſtudy to this ende did employ,
               The Crowne to obtayne, and them both to put downe:
               VVherein I God offended, prouokinge iuſt his ire,
               For this my attempt, and moſt wicked deſire.
            
            
               To curſed Cain compare my carefull caſe,
               VVhich did vniuſtly ſlay his Brother iuſt Abell,
               
               And did not I in rage make run that rufull race
               My Brother Duke of Clarence, whoſe death I ſhame to tell
               For that ſo ſtraunge it was, as it was horrible?
               For ſure hee drenched was, and yet no Water neare,
               VVhych ſtraunge is to bee tolde to all that ſhall it heare.
            
            
               The But hee was not whereat I did ſhoote,
               But yet hee ſtoode betweene the Marke, and mee,
               For had hee liued, for mee it was no boote
               To attempt the thinge that by no meanes could bee,
               For I third was then of my Brethren three:
               But yet I thought the Elder beinge gone,
               Then needes muſt I beare the ſtroke alone.
            
            
               
               Deſire of Rule made mee alas to rewe,
               My fatall fall I could it not foreſee,
               Puft vp in Pride, to Hauty then I grewe,
               That none my Peere I thought now could bee,
               Diſdayninge ſutch as were of high degree:
               Thus dayly ryſinge, and pullinge other downe,
               At laſt I ſhot how to win the Crowne.
            
            
               And dayly deuiſinge which was the beſt way
               And meane how I might my Nephues both deuour
               I ſecretely then ſent without further delay
               To Brackinbury then Lieutenaunt of the Tower,
               Requeſtinge him by letters to helpe vnto his power,
               For to accompliſhe this my deſyre, and will,
               And that hee would ſecretly my Brothers Children kill.
            
            
               Hee aunſwered playnely with a flat nay,
               Sayinge that to dye hee would not do that deede:
               But findinge then a proffer to my pray,
               Well worth a freende (quoth I) yet in time of neede.
               Iames Tyrrill hight his name, whom with all ſpeede,
               I ſent agayne to Brackinbury, as you heard before,
               Commaundinge him deliuer the Keyes of euery Dore.
            
            
               The Keyes hee rendered but Partaker would not bee
               Of that flagitious Fact. O happy man I ſay!
               As you haue heard before, hee rather choſe to dye
               Then on thoſe ſeely Lambes his violent handes to lay.
               His Conſcience him pricked, his Prince to betray:
               O conſtant minde! that wouldeſt not condiſcend
               Thee may I prayſe, and my ſelfe diſcommend.
            
            
               
               VVhat though heee refuſed, yet bee ſure you may,
               That other were as ready to take in hand that thinge,
               VVhich watched, and wayted as duly for their Pray,
               As euer did the Cat for the Mouſe takinge,
               And how they might their purpoſe beſt to paſſe bringe:
               VVhere Tyrrell hee thought good to haue no bloud ſhed,
               Becaſt them to kill by Smotheringe in their Bed.
            
            
               The Wolues at hande were ready to deuour
               The ſeely Lambes in Bed whereas they laye
               Abidinge deat
                     •
                  , and lookinge for the Hower,
               For well they wiſt, they could not ſcape away,
               Ah woe is mee, that did them thus betray,
               In aſſigninge this vile deede to bee done,
               By Myles Forreſt, and wicked Ihon Dighton.
            
            
               VVho priuely into their Chamber ſtale,
               In ſecret wiſe ſomewhat before Midnight,
               And gan the Bed together Tug, and hale,
               Be wrappinge them alas in wofull plight,
               Keepinge them downe, by force, by power, and might,
               With Halinge, Tugginge, Turmoylinge, Turnde, &amp; Toſt,
               Till they of force were Forced yeelde the Ghoſt.
            
            
               VVhych when I heard, my hart I felt was eaſed
               Of grudge, of greefe, of inward deadly payne,
               But with this deede the Nobles were diſpleaſed,
               And ſayd: O God, ſhall ſuch a Tyraunt raygne,
               That hath ſo cruelly his Brothers Children ſlayne?
               Which Brute once blowen in the Peoples Eares,
               Their dolour was ſutch, that they braſt out in Teares.
            
            
               
               But what thinge may ſuffiſe vnto the greedy man,
               The more bee bathes in bloud, the bloudier hee is alway:
               By proofe I do this ſpeake, which beſt declare it can,
               Which onely was the cauſe of this Princes decaye.
               The Wolfe was neuer greedier than I was of my Pray,
               But who ſo vſeth murther full well affirme I dare,
               With murther ſhall be quit, ere hee thereof beware.
            
            
               And marke the ſequell of this begon miſchiefr
               Which ſhortly after was cauſe of my decay,
               For high, and lowe conceyued ſutch a griefe
               And hate agaynſt mee, which ſought day by day,
               All wayes, and meanes that poſſiblye they may,
               On mee to bee reuenged for this ſinne,
               For cruell murderinge vnnaturally my kinne.
            
            
               Not onely kin, but Kinge the truth to ſaye
               VVhom vnkindly of Kingdome I bereft,
               His life from him I alſo raught awaye,
               With his Brathers, which to my charge was left.
               Of ambicion behold the worke, and weft,
               Prouokinge mee to do this haynous Treaſon,
               And murther them againſt all right and reaſon.
            
            
               After whoſe death thus wrought by violence,
               The Lords not ſykinge this vnnaturall deede,
               Began on mee to haue greate diffidence,
               Sutch brunninge hate gan in their hearts to breede,
               VVhich made me doubt, and ſore my daunger drede:
               VVhich doubt, and dreade proued not in vayne,
               By that enſued alas vnto my payne.
            
            
               
               For I ſuppoſinge all thinges were as I wiſhed,
               VVhen I had brought theſe ſeely Babes to bane,
               But yet in that my purpoſe far I miſſed:
               For as the Moone doth chaunge after the Wane,
               So chaunged the hearts of ſutch as I had tane
               To bee moſt true, to Troubles did mee turne,
               Sutch rage, and rancour in boylinge Breaſts do burne.
            
            
               And ſodaynly a brute abroade was blowen,
               That Buckingham the Duke both ſterne, and ſtout,
               In field was ready, with diuers to mee knowen,
               To geue mee Battayle if I durſt come out:
               VVhich daunted mee, and put mee in great doubt,
               For that I had no Army then prepared,
               But after that I little for it cared.
            
            
               But yet remembringe, that oft a little ſparke
               Suffered doth grow vnto a great flame,
               I thought it wiſedome wiſely for to warke,
               Muſtered then men in euery place I came.
               And marchinge forward dayly with the ſame,
               Directly towardes the Towne of Saliſbury,
               VVhere I gat knowledge of the Dukes Army.
            
            
               And as I paſſed ouer Saliſbury downe,
               The Rumour ran the Duke was fled, and gone,
               His Hoaſt diſperſed beſides Shreweſbury Towne,
               And hee diſmayed was left there poſt alone,
               Bewaylinge his chaunce, and makinge great mo
                     •
                  ne:
               Towards whom I haſted withall expedition,
               Makinge due ſearch, and dilligent inquiſition.
            
            
               
               But at the firſt I could not of him heare,
               For hee was ſcaped by ſecret Bywayes,
               Vnto the Houſe of Humfrey Banaſtar,
               Whom hee had mutch preferred in his Dayes,
               And was good Lord to him in all aſſayes:
               Which hee full euill requited in the ende,
               When hee was driuen to ſeeke a truſty freende.
            
            
               For it ſo happened to his miſhap, alas,
               When I no knowledge of the Duke could heare
               A Proclamation by my Commaundement was
               Publiſhed, and Cryed throughout euery Shyre,
               That who ſo could tell where the Duke were,
               A Thouſand marke ſhould haue for his payne.
               What thinge ſo hard but Money can obtayne?
            
            
               But were it for Money, Meede, or Dreede,
               That Banaſtar thus Betrayed his Gheſt,
               Diuers haue diuerſly deuined of this deede,
               Some deeme the worſt, and ſome Iudge the beſt,
               The doubt not diſſolued, nor playnely expreſt,
               But of the Dukes death hee doubtleſſe was cauſe,
               Which dyed without iudgement or order of Lawes.
            
            
               Loe! this Noble Duke I brought thus vnto bane,
               Whoſe doinges I doubted, and had in great dred,
               At Banaſtars houſe I made him to bee tane,
               And without iudgement bee ſhortned by the head,
               By the Shriffe of Shropſhire to Saliſbury led.
               In the Market place vpon the Scaffolde newe,
               Where all the Beholders did mutch his death rewe.
            
            
               
               And after this done I brake vp the hoaſte,
               Great y applauded with this heauy hap,
               And forthwith I ſent to euery Sea coaſte
               To fore ſee all miſchieues, and ſtop euery gap,
               Before they ſhould chaunce, or light in my lap,
               Geuinge them in charge to haue good regarde,
               The Sea coaſt to keept with good watch and warde,
            
            
               Directinge my letters vnto euery Shriue,
               VVith ſtrait Commaundement vnder our name,
               To ſuffer no man in their partes to ariue
               Nor to paſſe forth out of the ſame,
               As they tendered our fauour, and vodye would our blame,
               Doinge therein their payne, and induſtry,
               VVith diligent care, and vigilant Eye.
            
            
               And thus ſettinge thinges in order as you heare:
               To preuent miſchieues that might then betide,
               I thought my ſelfe ſure, and out of all feare,
               And for other thinges began to prouide:
               To Notingham Caſtle ſtrait did I ride,
               VVhere I was not very longe ſpace,
               Straunge tydinges came which did me fore amaze.
            
            
               Reported it was, and that for certaynty,
               Th' Earle of Richmonde landed was in Wales
               At Milforde Hauen with an huge Army,
               Diſmiſſinge his Nauy which were many Sayles:
               VVhich at the firſt I thought flyinge Tales.
               But in the ende did otherwiſe proue,
               VVhich not a little did mee vexe, and moue.
            
            
               
               Thus fawninge Fortune gan on mee to frowne,
               And caſt on mee her ſcoruefull lowringe looke:
               Then gan I feare the fall of my Renowne,
               My heart it faynted, my Sinowes ſore they ſhooke,
               This heauy hap a ſcourge for ſinne I tooke,
               Yet did I not then vtterly diſpayre,
               Hopinge Storms paſt the whether ſhould bee fayre.
            
            
               And then with all ſpeede poſſible I might,
               I cauſed them muſter throughout euery Shyre,
               Determininge with the Earle ſpeedely to fight,
               Before that his power mutch encreaſed were,
               By ſutch as to him great fauour did beare:
               VVhich were no ſmal number by true report made,
               Dayly repayringe him for to ayde.
            
            
               Directinge my letters to diuers Noble men,
               VVith earneſt requeſt their power to prepare,
               To Notingham Caſtle whereas I lay then.
               To ayde and aſſiſt mee in this waighty affayre:
               VVhere ſtrayt to my preſence did then repayre,
               Thou Duke of Northfolke, his Eldeſt Sonne alſo,
               Wyth th' Earle of Northumberland, and many other mo.
            
            
               And thus beinge furniſht with men, and munition,
               Forward wee marched in order of Battayle ray,
               Makinge by Scouts euery way inquiſition,
               In what place the Earle with his Campe ſay:
               Towards whom directly wee tooke then our way,
               Euermore mindinge to ſeeke our moſt auayle,
               In place conuenient to geue to him Battayle.
            
            
               
               So longe wee laboured, at laſt our Armies met
               On Boſworth playne beſides Leceſter towne,
               Where ſure I thought the Garland for to get,
               And purchaſe peace, or elſe to loſe my Crowne.
               But ſickle Fortune alas on me did frowne,
               For when I was Encamped in the Fielde,
               Where moſt I truſted, I ſooneſt was be guilde.
            
            
               The Brand of mallice thus kindlinge in my breſt
               Of deadly hate which I to him did beare,
               Pricked mee forwarde, and bad mee not deſiſt,
               But boldly fight, and take at all no feare,
               To win the field, and the Earle to conquere:
               Thus hopinge glory great to gayne, and get,
               Mine Army then in order did I ſet.
            
            
               Be tyde mee life or death I deſperately ran,
               And ioyned me in Battayle with this Earle ſo ſtoute,
               But Fortune ſo him ſauoured that hee the Battayle wan
               With force and great power I was beſet about.
               Which when I did behold, in mids of the whole route
               With deut of Sword I caſt m

                  e on him to be reuenged,
               Where in the midſt of them my wretched life I ended.
            
            
               My body was hurried, and Tugged like a Dog,
               On horſebacke all naked, and bare as I was borne.
               My head, hands, and feete, downe hanginge like a Hog,
               Wyth Dirt, and bloud heſprent, my Corps all to torne,
               Curſnge the day that euer I was borne,
               With greeuous wounds bee mangled moſt horrible to ſee,
               So ſore they did abhorre this my vile cruelty.
            
            
               
               Loe! heere you may behold the due, and iuſt rewarde
               Of tyranny, and treaſon which God doth moſt deteſt,
               For if vnto my duety I had taken regarde,
               I might haue liued ſtill in honour with the beſt,
               And had I not attempt the thinge that I ought leſte.
               But deſire to rule alas did mee ſo blinde,
               VVhich cauſed mee to do againſt nature, and kinde.
            
            
               Ah cruſed Caytiue, why did I climbe ſo hye,
               VVhich was the cauſe of th's my balefull thrall.
               For ſtill I thirſted for the Regall Dignity,

               And ſeeke not right by wronge to ſuppreſſe,
               For God hath promiſt ech wronge to redreſſe.
            
            
               See here the fine, and fall of mee,

               WHen I had read this, wee had muche talke
aboute it. For it was thought not vehement
enough for ſo violent a man as king
Rychard had bene. The matter was wel enough
liked of ſome, but the meetre was miſliked almoſt
of all.
            And when diuers therfore woulde not allow it,
what (quoth one) You know not whereupon you
ſticke: els you would not ſo much miſlike this beecauſe
of the vncertayne meetre. The cumelyneſſe
called by the Rhetoricians Decorum, is ſpecially to
be obſerued in al thinges. Seeing than that king
Richard neuer kept meaſure in any of his doinges,
ſeeing alſo he ſpeaketh in Hel, wheras is no order: it
were againſt the Decorum of his perſonage to vſe
eyther good meeter or order.
            And therfore if his Oration were far worſe, in my
opinion it were more fytt for him. Mars and the
Muſes did neuer agree. Neither is to bee ſuffered
that their myld ſacred Arte ſhould ſeeme to procede
from ſo cruel and prophane a mouth as his: ſeinge
they themſelues do abhorre it.
            And although we reade of Nero, that hee was excellent
both in Muſicke, &amp; in verſifyinge, yet do not
I remember that euer I ſaw any ſong or Verſe of
his making: Minerau iuſtly prouiding that no monument
ſhould remaine of any ſuch vniuſt vſurpaton.
And therfore let this paſſe euen as it is which

the writer I knowe both could and would amend
in many places, ſaue for keepinge the Decorū
                whych
hee purpoſely hath oblerued heerein.
            In deede (quoth I) as you ſay: It is not meete yt
ſo diſorderly, and vnnaturall a man as Kynge Rychard
was, ſhould obſerue any metrycall order in
his talke: which notwithſtandinge in many places
of his Oration is very wel kept: it ſhal paſſe therefore
euen as it is, though to good for ſo euill a perſon.
Then they willed me to reade ye blacke Smith,
With a good will (quoth I) but firſt you muſt Imagin
that you ſee him ſtandinge on a Ladder
ouerſhrined wyth the Tybourne a meete
Stage for all ſutch Rebels, &amp; Traytours:
&amp; there ſtoutly ſaying as
followeth.

               But now behold he doth bewayle the ſame:
               Thus after wits their raſhneſſe do depraue,
               Behold diſmaid he dare not ſpeake for ſhame,
               He lookes like one that late came from the graue,
               Or one that came foorth of Trophonius caue,
               For that in wy the had ſo little pith,
               As hee a Lord to ſerue a traytout Smith.
            
            
               Such is the courage of the noble hart,
               Which doth deſpiſe the vile and baſer ſort,
               He may not touch that ſauours of the cart,
               Him liſteth not with ech Iacke

                  out to ſport,

               The courtly ſilkes match ſeeld with homely frees.
            
            
               
               But ſurely Baldwin if I were allowd
               To ſay the truth, I could ſomwhat declare:
               But clarkes wil ſay, this Smyth doth waxe to proud,
               Thus in precepts of wiſedome to compare,
               But Smithes muſt ſpeake that clarkes for feare ne dare
               It is a thing that all men may lament,
               When clarkes keepe cloſe the truth leaſt they be ſhent.
            
            
               The Hoſtler, Barber, Myller, and the Smyth,
               Heare of the ſawes of ſuch as wiſedome ken,
               And learne ſome wit although they want the pith,
               The clarkes pretend and yet both now and then,
               The greateſt clarkes proue not the wiſeſt men:
               It is not right that men forbid ſhould bee:
               To ſpeake the truth al were he bond or free.
            
            
               And for becauſe I haue vſed to fret and fome,
               Not paſſing greatly whom I ſhould diſpleaſe,
               I dare be bold awhile to play the mome,
               Out of my ſacke ſome others faultes to leaſe,
               And let mine owne behinde my backe to peyſe,
               For' hee that hath his owne before his eye,
               Shal not ſo quicke anothers fault eſpie
            
            
               I ſay was neuer no ſuch woful caſe,
               As is when honour doth it ſelfe abuſe:
               The noble man that vertue doth embrace,
               Repreſſeth pride, and humbleneſſe doth vſe,
               By wiſdome workes, and raſhneſſe doth refuſe
               His wanton wil and luſt that bridle can,
               In deede is gentle both to God and man.
            
            
               
               But where the nobles want both wit and grace,
               Regard no reede, care not but for their luſt,
               Oppreſſe the Poore, ſet will in reaſons place,
               And in their words, and domes bee founde vniuſt,
               Wealth goeth to wracke till all lye in the duſt:
               There Fortune frownes, and ſpite beginneth to growe,
               Till high, and lowe, and all bee ouerthrow.
            
            
               Then ſith that vertue hath ſo good reward,
               And after vice ſo duelye wayteth ſhame,
               How hapth that Princes haue no more regard,
               Their tender youth with vertue to enflame?
               For lacke whereof the wit and will is lame,
               Infect with folly, prone to luſt, and pride,
               Not knowinge howe them ſelues or theirs to guide.
            
            
               VVhereby it happeneth to the wanton wight,
               As to a Ship vpon the ſtormy Seas,
               VVhich lackinge ſterne to guide it ſelfe a right,
               From Shore, to Shore the Winde, and Tide do teeſe,
               Findinge no place to reſt and take his eaſe,
               Till at the laſt it ſinke vpon the Sande:
               So fare they all that haue not vertue cand.
            
            
               The Plowman firſt his Lande doth dreſſe, and tourne,
               And makes it apt or ere the Seede bee ſowe,
               VVhereby hee is full like to reape good Corne.
               VVhere otherwiſe no ſeede but weede would growe:
               By which enſample men may eaſely knowe,
               VVhen youth haue wealth before they can well vſe it
               It is no wonder though they do abuſe it.
            
            
               
               How can hee rule well in a common wealth,
               VVhich knoweth not himſelfe in rule to frayne?
               How ſhould hee rule himſelfe in ghoſtly health,
               VVhich neuer learnde one leſſon for the ſame:
               If ſutch catch harme their Parentes are to blame:
               For needes muſt they bee blynde, and blindly led.
               Where no good leſſon can bee taught or read.
            
            
               Some thinke their youth diſcreet, and wiſely taught,
               That brag, and boaſt, and weare their Feather braue,
               Can royſt, and rout, both lowre, and looke a loft,
               Can ſwere, and ſtare, and call their felowes Knaue,
               Can pyll, and poll, and catch before they craue,
               Can Carde, and Dyce, both Cog, and Foyſt at fare,
               Play on vnthrifty, till their Purſe bee bare.
            
            
               Some teach their youth to pipe, to ſinge, and daunce,
               To Hauke, to Hunt, to chooſe and kill the game,
               To wynde their horne, and with their horſe to praunce,
               To play at Tenis, ſet the Lute in frame,
               Run at the Ringe and vſe ſutch other game:
               Which feates although they bee not all vnfit,
               Yet cannot they the marke of vertue hit.
            
            
               For noble youth, there is nothinge ſo meete
               As learninge is, to knowe the good from ill:
               To knowe the Tongues, and perfectly endyte,
               And of the lawes to haue a perfect ſkill,
               Things to reforme as right, and iuſtice will:
               For honour is ordeyned for no cauſe,
               But ſee right mayntayned by the Lawes,
            
            
               
               It ſpites my heart to heare when Noble men
               Cannot dicloſe their ſecrets to their frend,
               In ſauegarde ſure with Paper, Inke, and Pen,
               But firſt they muſt a ſecretary finde,
               To whom they ſhow the bottome of their minde:
               And bee hee falſe, or true, a Blab, or cloſe,
               To him they muſt their counſayle needes diſcloſe.
            
            
               And where they rule that haue of Lawe no ſkill,
               There is no boote, they needes muſt ſeeke for ayde:
               Then ruled are they, and rule as others will:
               As hee that on a Stage his part hath playde:
               But hee was taught nought hath hee done, or ſayde.
               Sutch youth therefore ſ
                     •
                  eke Science of the Sage,
               As thinke to Rule when that yee come to age.
            
            
               Where youth is brought vp in feare, and Obedience,
               Kept from ill company, brydeled of their luſt,
               Do ſerue God duely, and know their allegiauuce,
               Learne godly wiſedome which time nor age can ruſt:
               There Prince, People, and Peeres needes proſper muſt,
               For happy are the People, and bleſſed is that Land,
               Where Truth, and Vertue haue got the ouer hand.
            
            
               I ſpeake this Baldwyn of this rufull Lorde,
               Whom I perforce do heere preſent to thee,
               Hee faynts ſo ſore hee may not ſpeake a worde,
               I pleade his cauſe without rewarde, or Fee,
               And am inforſt to ſpeake for him, and mee.
               If in his youth hee had beene wiſely tought,
               Hee ſhould not now his Wit ſo deere haue bought.
            
            
               
               For what is hee that hath but halfe a Wit,
               But may well know that Rebelles cannot ſpeede,
               Marke well my Tale, and take good heede to it,
               Recount it well and take it for good reede,
               If it proue vutrue I will not truſt my creede.
               Was neuer Rebell before the World, nor ſince,
               That could or ſhall preuayle againſt his Prince.
            
            
               For ere the Subiect beginneth to rebell,
               Within himſelfe let him conſider well,
               Foreſee the daunger, and beat well in his Brayne,
               How hard it is his purpoſe to obtayne,
               For if hee once bee entred to the Brears,
               Hee hath a raginge Wolfe faſt by the Ears.
            
            
               And when hee is once entred to rule the beaſtly rout,
               Although hee would hee can no way get out.
               Hee may bee ſure noue will to him reſorte,
               But ſutch as are the vile, and raſcall ſorte.
               All honeſt men as well the moſt as leſt,
               To taſt of treaſon will vtterly deteſt.
            
            
               Then let him way how longe hee can bee ſure,
               VVhere fayth, nor Frendſhip may no while endure:
               Hee whom hee truſteth moſt, to gayne a groate
               VVyll fall him from, and aſſay to cut his throate,
               Amonge the Knaues, and ſlaues where vice is rooted,
               There is no other Freendſhip to bee looked.
            
            
               With Slaſhers, Slaues,' &amp; Snuffers ſo falſhoode is in price
               The ſimple fayth is deadly ſinne, and vertue counted vice.
               And where the Quarrell is ſo vile, and bad,
            
            
               
               That hope of ayde then is there to bee had?
               Thyncks hee that Men will run at this, or that,
               To do a thinge they knowe not hew, or what?
            
            
               Nor yet what daunger may thereof betide,
               VVhere Wyſedome woulde they ſhould at home abide,
               Rather then ſeeke, and knowe not what to finde.
               Wyſemen will firſt debate this in their minde:
               Full ſure they are if that they go to wrecke,
               Without all grace they looſe both head, and necke.
            
            
               They looſe their Lands, and Goods, their Childe, and Wyfe
               With Sorrow, and Shame ſhall leade a wofull Lyfe,
               If hee bee ſlayne in field hee dieth accurſt,
               Which of all wrecks wee ſhould attempt the worſt:
               And hee that dieth defendinge his liege Lord,
               Is bliſt, and bliſt againe by Gods owne Worde.
            
            
               And where the Souldiers wages is vnpayde,
               There is the Captayne ſlenderly obayde,
               And where the Souldier is out of feare, and dreede,
               Hee will bee lacke when that there is moſt neede,
               And priuately hee ſeekes his eaſe, and leaſure,
               And will bee ruled but at his will, and pleaſure.
            
            
               And where ſome drawe forth, and other do draw backe,
               There in the ende muſt needes hee woe, and wracke:
               To hope for ayde of Lordes it is but vayne,
               VVhoſe fore taught wit of treaſon knoweth the payne,
               They knowe what power a Prince hath in his Land,
               And what it is with Rebelles for to ſtand.
            
            
               
               They know by treaſon honour is defaced,
               Their ofſpring and their progenie diſgraced,
               They know to honour is not ſo worthy a thing,
               As to be true and faithful to their king,
               Aboue cogniſaunce or armes, or pedigrew far,
               An vnſpotted cote is like a blazing ſtar:
            
            
               Therfore the rebel is accurſt and mad,
               That hopeth for that which rebel neuer had:
               Who truſting ſtil to dales doth hang in hope,
               Til at the laſt he hang faſt by the rope,
               For though ſuch tales be told that hope might feede,
               Such fooliſh hope hath ſtil vnhappie ſpeede.
            
            
               It is a cuſtome that neuer wil be broken,
               In broyles the bag of lies is euer open,
               Such lying newes men daylye wil inuent,
               As can the hearers fancy beſt content,
               And as the newes do runne and neuer ceaſe,
               So more and more they dayly do encreaſe,
            
            
               And as they encreaſe they multiplie as faſt,
               That ten is ten hundred, ten thouſand at the laſt.
               And though the rebel had once got the 
                     •
                  elo,
               Thinkes he thereby to make his prince to yeild?
               A princes power within his owne region,
               Is not ſo ſoone brought vnto confuſion.
            
            
               For Kinges by God are ſtronge, and ſtoutly harted,
               That they of Subiects will not bee ſubuerted:
               If Kinges would yeld, yet God would them reſtrain,
            
            
               
               Of whom the Prince hath grace, and power to raygne:
               VVho ſtraytly chargeth vs aboue all thinge,
               That no man ſhould reſiſt agaynſt his Kinge.
            
            
               VVho that reſiſteth his dread Soueraygne Lorde,
               Doth dampne his ſoule by Gods owne very worde.
               A Chriſtian Subiect ſhould with honour due,
               Obey his Soueraygne though hee were a Iewe:
               
               VVhereby aſſured when Subiects do rebell,
               Gods wrath is kindled, and threatneth fyre, and hell.
            
            
               It is ſoone knowen when Gods wrath is kyndled,
               How they ſhall ſpeede with whom hee is offended:
               If God gaue victory to whom hee liketh beſt,
               Why looke they for it whom God doth moſt deteſt?
               For treaſon is hatefull, and abhord in Gods ſight,
               Example of Iudas that moſt wicked Wight:
            
            
               VVhich is the chiefe cauſe no treaſon preuayles,
               For ill muſt hee ſpeede, whom Gods wrath aſſayles:
               Let Traytors, and Rebels looke to ſpeede then,
               VVhen Gods mighty power is ſubiect to men.
               Mutch might bee ſayde that goeth more neere the Pith,
               But this ſuffiſeth for a rurall Smith.
            
            
               Baldwin when thou heareſt my reaſon in this caſe,
               Belike thou thinkeſt I was not very wyſe,
               And that I was accurſt, or elſe lacked grace,
               VVhich knowinge the ende of my fond Enterpriſe,
               VVould thus preſume agaynſt my Prince to ryſe:
               But as there is a cauſe that moueth euery woe,
               Somewhat there was whereof this ſore did growe.
            
            
               
               And to be plaine and ſimple in this caſe,
               The cauſe why I ſuch matter tooke in hand,
               Was nothing els but pryde and lacke of grace,
               Vayne hope of helpe, and tales both falſe and fond:
               By meanes whereof I did my prince withſtand,
               Denied the taxe aſſeſt by conuocation
               To mainteine warre againſt the Scottiſh Nation.
            
            
               Whereat the Corniſh men did much repine,
               For they of Gold and Siluer were ful bare,
               And liued hardly digging in the Myne,
               They ſaid they had no money for to ſpare:
               Began firſt to grudge, and then to ſweare and ſtare,
               Forgot their due obeyſaunce, and raſhly fel to rauing,
               And ſaid they would not beare ſuc polling and ſuch ſhauing.
            
            
               They firſt accuſde the king as authour of their griefe,
               And then the byſhop Moreton. and ſir Reinold Bray,
               For they then were about the king moſt chiefe,
               Becauſe they thought the hole fault in them lay:
               They did proteſt to ryd them out of the way.
               Such thanke haue they that rule about a prince,
               They beare the blame of other mens offence.
            
            
               When I perceiued the commons in a rore,
               Then I and Flamocke conſulted both together,
               To whom the people reſorted more and more,
               Lamenting and crying, helpe vs now or neuer,
               Breake this yoake of bondage then are we free for euer:
               Whereat we enflamed in hope to haue a fame,
               To be their captaines tooke on vs the name.
            
            
               
               Then might you heare the people make a ſhout,
               And crye, God ſaue the Captaines, &amp; ſende vs al good ſpeede,
               Then hee that fainted was counted but a lout,
               The ruffians ran abroade to ſowe ſedicious ſeede:
               To call for company then there was no neede
               For euerye man laboured another to entice,
               To be partaker of his wicked vice.
            
            
               Then al ſuch newes as made for our auaile,
               Was brought to me, but ſuch as ſounded ill,
               Was none ſo bold to ſpeake or yet bewayle:
               Euerich was ſo wedded vnto his wyll,
               That foorth they cryed with bowes, ſword and byll.
               And what the ruffler ſpake, the lout toake for a verdite
               For there the beſt was worſt, the worſt was beſt regarded.
            
            
               For when men goe a madding, there ſtil the vyler part
               Conſpire together and wil haue al the ſwaye,
               And bee it wel or il, they muſt haue al the port,
               As they wil doe, the reſt muſt needes obay,
               They prattle and prate as doth the Popingaye:
               They crye and commaund the reſt to keepe tharray,
               Whiles they may raunge and rob for ſpoyle and pray.
            
            
               And when we had prepared euery thing,
               We went to Tawnton with al our prouiſion,
               And there we ſlue the Prouoſ
                     •
                   of Pentyn,
               For that on the Subſedie hee ſate in commiſſion:
               He was not wiſe, nor yet of great diſcretion,
               That durſt approach his enemies in their rage,
               When wit nor reaſon could their yre aſſwage.
            
            
               
               From thence we went to Welles, where wee were receiued
               Of this Lord Awdley, as of our chiefe captaine,
               And ſo had the name, but yet he was deceiued,
               For I in deede did rule the clubbiſh trayne,

               And if they hap their purpoſe to obtaint,
               Their wealth is woe, their honour care and paine.

               IT is pity (quoth one) that the metre is
no better ſeeing ye matter is ſo good: you
may do very wel to helpe it, and a little
fyling would make it formal.
            The authour himſelfe (quoth I) coulde
haue done that, but he would not, and hath deſyred
me that it maye paſſe in ſuche rude, ſort as you
haue hearde it: for hee obſerueth therein a double
decorum both of the Smith, and of himſelfe: for he
thinketh it not meete for the Smyth to ſpeake nor
for himſelfe to wryte in any exacte kinde of meeter
Welſayd another: the matter is notable to teache
al people aſwel officers as ſubiects to cōſyder their
eſtates and to lyue in loue &amp; obedience to the higheſt
powers. what ſo euer they bee, whom God eyther
by byrth, law, ſucceſſion, or vniuerſal election,
doth or ſhall aucthoriſe in his owne rowme to execute
his lawes and iuſtice, among any people or nation:
for by all theſe meanes God placeth his deputies,
and in my iudgemēt there is no meane ſo good
either for the cōmon quiet of the people, or for gods
free choiſe, as the natural order of enheritaunce by
lyneal diſcent for ſo it is left in Gods hands, to create
in the wombe what prince hee thinketh meeteſt
for his purpoſes: the people alſo know their princes
and therfore the more gladly and willinglie receiue

their Male thinking it not meete for the fyminine
ſexe to beare the royal office: yet if they conſyder all

circumſtaunces, and the chiefeſt vſes of a prince in
a realme, they ſhal ſee howe they are deceiued. For
princes are Gods lieutenauntes or deputies, to ſee
gods lawes executed among their ſubiects, not to
rule accordinge to their owne luſtes or deuiſes, but
by the preſcript of Gods lawes: ſo that the chiefeſt
point of a princes office cōſiſteth in obediēce to god
and to his ordinaunces, &amp; what ſhould let but that
a woman may be as obediente vnto God as a mā?
The ſecond point of a princes office is to prouide for
the impotent, nedy, and helpeleſſe, as widowes, orphanes,
lame, and decrepite perſons: &amp; ſeeing women
are by nature tender harted, milde, and pitiful
who may better than they diſcharge this dutie?
Yea but a woman lacketh courage, boldneſſe, and
ſtomacke, to withſtand the aduerſarie, and ſo are
her ſubiects an open ſpoile to their enemies. Debora,
Iael, Iudith. Thomiris, and other do proue the contrarie.
But graunt it were ſo: what harme were that
ſeeing victorie conſiſteth not in wyt or for

doth his dutie in obaying God, and cauſing Iuſtice
to be miniſtred according to Gods lawes, ſhal not
onely lacke warre (be he man, woman or child) but
alſo be a terrour to al other princes. And if God ſuffer
any at any time to be aſſayled it is for ye deſtruction
of the aſſayler, whether he be

lighteninges from the ayre and ſkies. Moe warres
haue bene ſought throughe the wilfull &amp; hauty courages
of kinges and greater deſtructions hapned
to realme thereby, than by any other meanes. And
as for wiſedome and pollicye, ſeeing it conſiſteth in
folowing the counſel of many godly, learned, &amp; long
experienced heades, it were better to haue a Woman,
who conſideringe her owne weakenes and
inabilitie, ſhould be ruled thereby, than a man which
preſuming vpon his owne fond brayne, will heare
no aduiſe ſaue his owne. You muſe peraduenture

ranke traytour and rebel, and ſhalbe ſure to proſper

againſt Gods law, made by common conſet for

the wealth of the realme, and commaunded to bee

ſuch duties, as by conſent of the high court of Parliament,
are appointe to the Prince for the defence
and preſeruation of the realme. You haue ſayd very
truly herein (quoth I) and I truſt this terrible
example of the Blacke Smyth, will put all men in
mynde of their duties and teach them to be obediēt
to al good lawes, and lawful contributions. The
ſcriptures do forbid vs to rebel, or forciblie to withſtand

               Whoſe beauty ſhone like Phoebus in the ayre.

                  pe ſome ſayd was ſeemely to ech ſight,
               My countenaunce did ſhow a ſober grace,
               Myne eyes in lookes were neuer proued light,
               My tongue in wordes was chaſt in euery caſe,
               Myne eares were deafe and would no louers place,
               Saue that (alas) a prince did blot my brow.
               Loe, there the ſtrong did make the weake to bow.
            
            
               
               The maieſtie that kinges to people beare,
               The ſtately port, the awful cheare they ſhow,
               Doth make the meane to ſhrinke &amp; couch for fea

               Like as the hound, that doth his maiſter knowe:
               What then, ſince I was made vnto the bow:
               There is no cloake, can ſerue to hyde my fault,
               For I agreed the fort he ſhould aſſault.
            
            
               The Eagles forte ſubdues ech bird that flies.
               What mettal may reſiſt the flaming fire?
               Doth not the Sunne, daſtll the cleareſt eyes,
               And melt the yſe, and make the froſt retire?
               Who can withſtand a puiſſaunt kinges deſire?
               The ſtiffeſt ſtones are perced through with tooles,
               The wiſeſt are, with princes made but fooles.
            
            
               If kinde had wrought my forme in common frames,
               And ſet me forth in colours blacke and browne,
               Or beautye had beene parchd in Phoebus flames,
               Of ſhame faſt wayes had pluct my fethers downe,
               Then had I kept my fame and good renowne:
               For natures giftes was cauſe of al my griefe.
               A pleaſaunt pray entiſeth many a thiefe.
            
            
               Thus wo to thee that wrought my peacockes pride,
               By cloathing me with natures tapiſtrie,
               Wo worth the hue wherein my face was dyde,
               Which made me thinke I pleaſed euery eye:
               Like as the ſterres make men behold the ſkie,
               So beauties ſhow doth make the wiſe ful fond.
               And bringes free hartes ful of to endieſſe bond.
            
            
               
               But cleare from blame my frendes cannot be found
               Before my time my youth they did abuſe:
               In mariage, a prentiſe was I bound,
               Then that meere loue I knew not how to vſe.
               But wel away. that cannot me excuſe,
               The harme is mine though they deuiſed my care,
               And I muſt ſmart and ſit in ſlaunderous ſnare.
            
            
               Yet geue me leaue to pleade my cauſe at large,
               If that the horſe de runne beyond his race,
               Or any thing that keepers haue in charge,
               Do breake their courſe, where rulers may take place:
               Or meate be ſet before the hungries face,
               Who is in fault thoffender yes or no,
               Or they that are the cauſe of al this woe?
            
            
               Note wel what ſtrife this forced mariage makes,
               What loathed liues do come where loue doth lacke.
               What ſcratching breers do grow vpon ſuch brakes,
               What common weales by it are brought to wracke,
               What beauye loade is put on pacientes backe,
               What ſtraunge delightes this br

                  unch of vice doth breede
               And marke what graine ſpringes out of ſuch a ſeede.
            
            
               Compel the hanke to ſit that is vnmand,
               Or make the hound vntaught to drawe the Deere,
               Or bring the free againſt his wil in hand,
               Or moue the ſad a pleaſaunt tale to heare,
               Your time is loſt and you are neuer the neere:
               So loue ne learnes of force the knot to knit,
               She ſerues but thoſe that feele ſweete fancies fit.
            
            
               
               The leſſe defame redoundes to my diſpraiſe,
               I was entiſte by traynes, and trapt by truſt:
               Though in my power remained yeas and nayes,
               Vnto my frendes yet needes conſent I muſt,
               In euery thing, ye lawful or vniuſt.
               They brake the bowes and ſhakt the tree by ſleight,
               And bent the wand y• mought haue grown ful ſtreite.
            
            
               VVhat helpe is this, the pale thus broken downe,
               The deere muſt needes in daunger runne aſtray:
               At me therfore why ſhould the world ſo frowne,
               My weakeneſſe made my youth a Princes pray.
               Though wiſedome ſhould the courſe of nature ſtay,
               Yet trye my caſe who liſt, and they ſhall proue,
               The rypeſt wits are ſooneſt thralles to loue.
            
            
               VVhat nede I more to cleare my ſelfe to much?
               A King me wan, and had me at his call:
               His royal ſtate his Princely grace was ſuch,
               The hope of will (that women ſeeke for all,)
               The eaſe, the wealth, the gyfts which were not ſmal,
               Beſieged me ſo ſtronglye round about,
               My power was weake I could not hold him out.
            
            
               Duke Hannibal in al his conqueſt great,
               Or Caeſar yet, whoſe triumphes did excede,
               Of al their ſpoyles which made them toyle and ſweate,
               VVere not ſo glad to haue ſo rich a meede,
               As was this Prince when I to him agreed.
               And yelded me a priſoner willinglye,
               As one that knew no way away to flye.
            
            
               
               The Nightingale for al his merye voyce
               Nor yet the Larke that yet delightes to ſing,
               Did neuer make the hearers ſo reioyce,
               As I with wordes haue made this worthy king:
               I neuer iarde, in tune was euery ſtring,
               I c

                  mpered ſo my tongue to pleaſe his eare,
               That what I ſaid was currant euery where.
            
            
               I ioynde my talke, my ieſtures, and my grace
               In wictie frames that long might laſt and ſtand,
               So that I brought the King in ſuch a caſe,
               That to his death I was his chiefeſt hand,
               I gouerned him that ruled al this land:
               I bare the ſword though he did weare the crowne,
               I ſtrake the ſtroke that threw the mightie downe:
            
            
               If Iuſtice ſaid that iudgement was but death,
               VVith my ſweete woordes I could the king perſwade,
               And make him pauſe and take therein a breath,
               Til I with ſuite the fautors peace had made:
               I knew what waye to vſe him in his trade,
               I had the arte to make the Lyon meeke.
               There was no point wherein I was to ſeeke.
            
            
               If I did frowne, who then did looke awrie:
               If I did ſmyle, who would not laugh outright?
               If I but ſpake, who durſt my wordes denie?
               If I purſued, who would forſake the flight?
               I meant my power was knowen to euery wight,
               On ſuch a height good hap had built my bower,
               As though my ſweete ſhould neuer haue turnd to ſower.
            
            
               
               My huſband then as one that knew his good,

                  ing the end and miſchief as it ſtoode,
               Againſt the King did neuer much repine,
               He ſaw the grape whereof he dranke the wine,
               Though inward thought his hart did ſtil torment.
               Yet outwardlye he ſeemde he was content.
            
            
               To purchaſe praiſe and win the peoples zeale,
               Yea rather bent of kinde to do ſome good,
               I euer did vphold the common weale,
               I had delight to ſaue the guiltleſſe bloud:
               Ech ſuters cauſe when that I vnderſtood,
               I did prefer as it had beene mine owne,
               And helpe them vp that might haue bene orethrowne.
            
            
               My power was preſt to right the pooremans wrong,
               My handes were free to geeue where nede required,
               To watch for grace I neuer thought it long,
               To doe men good I nede not be deſired.
               Nor yet with giftes my hart was neuer hyred.
               But when the Ball was at my foote to guide,
               I plaied to thoſe that Fortune did abide.
            
            
               My want was wealth, my woe was eaſe at wil,

               My Fortune thou was far about my ſkil,
               My ſtate was great, my glaſſe did euer runne,
               My fatal 
                     ••
                  reede ſo happely was ſponne,
               That then I ſate in earthly pleaſurs clad,
               And for the time a goodeſſe place I had.
            
            
               
               But I had not ſo ſone this life poſſeſt,
               But my good hap began to ſlip aſyde.
               And Fortune then did me ſo ſore moleſt,
               That vnto plaintes was turned al my Pride,
               It booted not to rowe againſt the tide:
               Myne dares were weake my hart and ſtrength did fayle,
               The winde was rough I durſt not beare a ſayle,
            
            
               VVhat ſteps of ſtrife belong to high eſtate?
               The climing vp is doubtful to endure,
               The ſeate it ſelfe doth purchaſe priuie hate,

               Ind cannot laſt they are ſo vayne a thing.
            
            
               VVe count no care to catch that we do wiſh,
               But what we win is long to vs vnknowne,

               The ſetled mynde is free from Fortunes power,
               They neede not feare who looke not vp aloft,
               But they that clyme are careful euery hower,
               For when they fal they light not very ſoft:

               To bringe to paſſe his lewde, and falſe entent,
               To ſntch miſchiefe this Tyrants heart was bent:
               To God ne man hee neuer ſtoode in awe,

               And many moe, that were to longe to name:
               But moſt of all and in moſt wofull wyſe
               I had good cauſe this wretched man to blame,

                  ffered open ſhame,
               VVhere people were as thicke as is the Sande,
               I Penaunce tooke with Taper in my Hand.
            
            
               Ech Eye did ſtare, and looke mee in the Face,
               As I paſt by the Rumours on mee ran,
               But Patience then had lent mee ſutch a Grace,
               My quiet Lookes were prayſed of euery man:
               The Shamefaſte bloud brought mee ſutch coulour then
               That Thouſands ſayd, which ſawe my Sober cheere,
               It is great ruth to ſee this Woman heere.
            
            
               But what preuaylde the peoples pitty there?
               This raginge Wolfe would ſpare no guiltleſſe bloud.
               Oh wicked Wombe that ſutch ill fruict did beare,
               Oh curſed Earth that yeldeth forth ſutch Mud,
               The Hell conſume all thiuges that did thee good,
               The Heauens ſhut their Gates againſt thy Sprite,
               The World tread downe thy Glory vnder Feete.
            
            
               I aſke of God a vengeaunce on thy Bones,
               Thy ſtinkinge Corps corrups the Ayre I know:
               Thy ſhamefull death no earthly Wight bemoanes,
               For in thy Lyfe thy workes were hated ſo,
               That euery man did wiſhe thy ouerthrowe:
               VVherefore I may, though parciall now I am,
               Curſe euery cauſe whereof thy body came.
            
            
               
               VVo worth the man that fathered ſutch a childe:
               VVo worth the Hower wherein thou waſt begate,
               VVo worth the Breſts that haue the world begilde,
               To nouriſh thee that all the World did hate,
               VVo worth the Gods that gaue thee ſutch a face,
               To liue ſo longe, that death deſerude ſo ofte.
               VVo worth the chaunce that ſet thee vp a loft.
            
            
               Yee Princes all, and Rulers euerychone,
               In puniſhment beware of hatreds ire.
               Before yee ſcourge, take heede, looke well thereon:
               In wrothes ill will if malice kindle fire,
               Your heartes will burne in ſutch a bote deſire,
               That in thoſe flames the Smoake ſhall dimme your ſight,
               Yee ſhall forget to ioyne your Iuſtice right.
            
            
               You ſhould not iudge till thinges bee well diſcernde,
               Your charge is ſtill to maintayne vpright lawes,
               In conſcience rules yee ſhould bee throughly learnde,
               VVhere clemency bids wrath, and raſhneſſe pauſe,
               And further ſayth: Strike not without a cauſe,
               And when yee ſmite do it for Iuſtice ſake,
               Then in good part ech man your Scourge will take.

               To make my plague a warrant for the reſt,

               But by ill will. and power I was oppreſt.
               Hee ſpoyled my goods, and left mee bare, and Poore,
               And cauſed mee to begge from Doore, to Doore.

               VVhere I was wont the golden Chaynes to weare,
               A paire of Beades about my Necke was wound,
