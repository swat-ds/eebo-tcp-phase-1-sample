            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                     Paid them their wages, of despaire and horrour;

                     Fri:
                     Now worthy Gentlemen, haue I not followed
                     My vndertakings with successe? Heeres entrance
                     Into a certaintie aboue a hope.
                  
                  
                     Heron.
                     Hopes are but hopes, I was ever confident, when I traded but in remnants, that my starres had reserv'd me to the title of a Viscount at least, honor is honor though cut out of any stuffes.
                  
                  
                     
                     Sket:
                     My brother Heron, hath right wisely delivered his opinion: for he that threeds his needle with the sharpe eyes of industrie, shall in time goe through-stitch, with the new suite of preferment.
                  
                  
                     Astley.
                     Spoken to the purpose my fine witted brother Sketon, for as no Indenture, but has its counterpawne; no Noverint but his Condition, or Defeysance; so no right, but may haue claime, no claime but may haue possession, any act of Parlament to the Contrary notwithstanding.
                  
                  
                     Frion.
                     You are all read in mysteries of State,
                     And quicke of apprehension, deepe in judgement,
                     Actiue in resolution; and tis pittie
                     Such counsaile should lye buryed in obscuritie.
                     But why in such a time and cause of triumph,
                     Stands the judicious Major of Corke so silent?
                     Beleeue it Sir, as ENGLISH RICHARD prospers,
                     You must not misse imployment of high nature.
                  
                  
                     Major.
                     If men may be credited in their mortalitie, which I dare not peremptorily averre, but they may, or not be; presumptions by this marriage are then (in sooth) of fruitfull expectation. Or else I must not justifie other mens beliefe, more then other should relie on mine.

                     But noble Counsellers, since now the present,
                     Requires in poynt of honor (pray mistake not)

                     Every man knowes what is best, as it happens: for my owne part, I beleeue it is true, if I be not deceived, that Kings must be Kings, and Subjects, Subjects. But which is which; you shall pardon me for that; whether we speake or hold our peace, all are mortall, no man knowes his end.
