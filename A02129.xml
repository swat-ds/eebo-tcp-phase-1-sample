            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the right honourable his very good
Lorde and Maister, Lorde Darcie of the North,
Robert Greene wisheth long life, prosperous successe,
with all increase of honour and vertue.
            
               EMilius Macedonicus (Right
honorable) thinking to gratifie
Alexander the great with some
curious peece of workmāship,
waded so far in the depth of his
art, as strayning curtesie with
cunning, he skipt beyonde his
skill, not being able to make it
perfect. Who being blamed of Pausanias, for striuing
further then his sleeue would stretch, answeared: that although
arte and skill were wanting to beautifie the
work, yet heart &amp; wil did polish that part, which lacke
of cunning had lefte vnperfect, ouershadowing the blemish
of disabilitie, with the vaile of sincere affection.
Whose aunsweare, as one guiltie of the like crime, I
clayme for a sufficient excuse of my follie, that durst enterprise
to striue beyond my strength, knowing my selfe
vnable, both by nature and art, to bring such a weighty
matter to a wise end. For if the fouler is to be condēned
of follie, that takes in hande to talke of hunting; or the
merchant counted as madde, which medleth with the
rules of Astronomie: then may I well be dubbed a dolt,
which dare take in hand to discipher the substaunce of
loue, that am but a lout; or to shew the force of fancie,
which am but a foole. But as there is not a greater
cooling carde to a rash wit then want, so there is not
a more speedie spurre to a willing minde, then the force
of duetie: which droue me into a double doubt: eyther

to be counted as bold as blind Bayard, in presuming too
farre; or to incurre the preiudice of ingratitude, in being
too slacke; to bee thought vaineglorious in writing
without wit; or a thanklesse person forgetting my debt:
so hauing free choyse of them both, I thought it but a
light matter to bee counted ouer venturous, if I might
doe any thing which should shew some part of my duetie
vnto your honour: neyther did I euer care to be coū
               ted
bolde, if that blemishe might eyther pleasure your
Lordship, or els make manifest my good will, whiche
alwaies did wishe to be with the formost of your welwillers.
But as wishes are of no value, so his will is as
vaine, that couetes to pay his debt with a counterfeite
coyne: wherein I both finde the fault, and commit the
offence. For being greatly indebted to your honour by
duetie, for the first payment I offer a peece of work neither
worth the wetting nor wearing, the receiuing nor
reading, more meete for the Apothecaries pots, then a
noble mans hand; fitter for the pedler to rent, then Gentlemen
to reade. Yet if the worke be weighed with my
simple wit, it is downe measure; and if my good will
might serue for a weight, although the stuffe bee light,
yet there are few woulde be heauier in the ballance. So
that hoping of your honours wonted curtesie, that you
will marke the mynd, and not the matter; the will, and
not the worke; I commit your honour to the almightie.
            Your Honours humble Seruant,
Robert Greene.
            
         
         
            
            To the Gentlemen readers.
            AFter that, Gentlemen, I had neither wel furnished nor finished
this imperfect peece of woorke, but brought it to a bare ende,
whether it were for imitation or art, I haue almost forgot, but for
one it was, I chanced to reade diuers Epistles of sundrie men written
to the readers, wherin I found the best learned of them also far
drenched in doubt of their disabilitie, &amp; almost fortified for feare
that want of skill shoulde be a blemish to their woorke, as (thinking
a flat confession should haue a plaine pardon) they cal their bookes
vanities, shadowes imperfect paterns, more meete for the Pedler
then the Printer, toyes, trifles, trash, trinkets. Some comparing thē
to cheeses, neither worth the tasting, nor eating, so their books, neither
worth the reading nor hearing: and yet the worst of them all
so perfectly polished with the pumice stone of eloquence, as in them
nature and art doe striue for supremacie. If then those learned
men doe count their works but counterfeit, that were carued with
such curious cunning, and tearmed them trash which were Merchant
ware: what shall I call mine, which is of such simple stuffe, as
it is neither worth the cheaping nor chaunging? Surely I wil leaue
the name to the readers gentle iudgement, because I cannot finde
one bad enough, that euery one may tearme it as their fancy leadeth
them. For there is no chaffer so charie, but some will cheape;
no ware so bad, but some wil buy; no booke so yll but some will both
reade it and praise it; &amp; none againe so curious, but some wil carpe
at it. Wel, so many heades, so many wittes. If Gentlemen will take
my booke as a toy to passe away the time, and weigh mere of my
meaning then of the matter, and more of my wil, then eyther of my
wit, or the worke; if I say, they shall shew me this curtesie, it shal be
both a spurre to prick me forward to attempt further, and a sufficient
recompence for my trauell,
            Robert Greene.
         
         
            
            Roger Portington Esquier, in commendation
of the booke.
            IF Grecia soyle may vaunt her hap and lucky chaunce,
            as nurse of Clios clarkely crue, her state t'aduaunce,
            Or Smirna boast of Homers skil, for hope of fame,
            If royall Rome may reape renowne by Tullies name,
            Or Virgils countrie village vaunt that she excell,
            Dan Ouids natiue land may striue to beare the bell:
            Then Britaine soyle may brauely boast her state in fine,
            That she a new Pernassus is, the Muses shrine.
            No finer wittes in Grecia raigned then Britayne breedes,
            No brauer workes in Smirna wrought then English deeds.
            If passing port of Poets praise was euer founde
            In Mantua, the like is got in Britayne ground.
            If Tullie wan the golden spurres of fame by prose,
            And reaped in Rome such rich renowne as wel as those:
            Our Authour beautifies this Brittayne soyle for why?
            His stately style in English prose doth climbe the skie.
            His filed phrase deserues in learnings throne to sit,
            And his Mamillia darkens quite the Frenchmens wit.
            Yea if that any haue beene crowned with laurel greene,
            This Greene deserues a laurel braunch I weene:
            For why? his pen hath paynted out dan Cupids craft,
            And set at large the doubtfull chance of fancies drafte:
            Yea in such comely colours sure his workes enbost,
            As he for English phrase may sit amidst the most.
            And thogh he thinks his booke too rude to win such fame,
            His foes would say that he by right deserues the same.

            Mamillia.
            
               THe Citie of Padua, renoumed as wel for the
antiquitie of the famous Uniuersitie, as also
for the notable ryuer now called Po, when
the Ciuill warres were moste hot, and the
broyles of dissention so ryfe, that the Gothes
and Hungarians with sodaine inuasion had
subuerted the whole state of Italy, was euer
so fortified with couragious Captaines &amp; warlike Souldiors,
and so wel gouerned by the prudent pollicy of their Magistrate
Signior Gonsaga, that they alwayes set out the flagge of defiaunce,
and neuer came so much as once to parle of peace with
their enemies; although Venice, Florence, Sienna, with many
other Cities (as Machianell in his Florentine historie maketh
report) at the hotte Skirmishes and fierce Assaults of the Soldiours,
accepted conditions of peace willinglye: so much preuailed
the pollitique wisdome of the wise Rular. Out of whose
liue by discent yssued one Francesco Gonzaga, a Gentleman
whome fortune did not onely endue with wealth, but also beautified
with as great wisdome, as any of his predecessors: so that
it was in doubt, whether he wanne more fauour for his wit, or
feare for his ryches: whether hee were better lyked for his calling,
or loued for his courtesie: but sure whether it were, he had
gayned the hearres of all the people. And yet for all these golden
giftes of Nature, he was more bound vnto Fortune, which
had bestowed vpon him one onely daughter, called Mamillia, of
such exquisit perfection and singular beautie, as the lineaments
of her body, so perfectly portrayed out by nature, did shew this
gorgeous Goddesse to be framed by the common consent of all
the Graces: or els to purchase Nature some great commendation
by caruing a peece of so curious perfection. For her body
was not onely beautified with the outward blaze of beautie: but
her minde was also endued with the beames of inward bountie,
as yt men were rauished as much with the wōder of her wisdom,

as driuen into admiration with the fourme of her feature. But
what neede I to disciphet her excellent perfection, sith nature
had so cunningly paynted out the portraiture, both of her mind
and body, in such comly coulours, as it may suffice for me to say,
she was the flower of all Venice.
            
            This gallant Gyrle by her vertuous qualities had made
such a stealth in the heart of one Florion, a young Gentleman,
which serued as she did in the Dukes court at Venice, that hee
reposed his onely pleasure in her presence, and againe her onely
contentation consisted in his company, that they were two bodyes
and one soule, their will and wish was alike, the consent of
the one was a constraint to the other, the desire of Mamillia,
was the delight of Florion: yea the concord of their nature was
such, as no soppes of suspition, no mistes of distrust, no floddes
of ficklenes could once foyle their fayth, their friendship was so
firmely founded on the rocke of vertue: for this straight league
of lyking was not fleshly fanoy, but a meere choyce of Chastitie.
Whereby we may well note the broad blasphemy of those
which thinke, because the Towe cannot touch the fire, but it
must burne, no
                  •
                the Iuie claspe the Tree, vnlesse it sucke out
the sappe: so like wise the greene wood cannot touch the coales,
but it must flame, nor the Uine branch embrace the tender twig,
but it must consume it: that loue and lyking cannot be without
lust and lasci
                  •
               iousnes: that deepe desire cannot be without fleshly
affection: but this suspition proceedeth of an eull disposition.
This currish misconstruing commeth of a corrupt conscience,
they seeke others, where they haue beene hidde them selues: for
we may see by experience and manifest examples, that there
haue beene euen lewd Louers, which haue contented their disordinate
desire, onely with the courteous countenaunce of their
Mistresse, who although they were caught in the snare of beautie,
and altogether vowed vnto vanitie, yet they could so well
bridle their affections, that the onely sight of their Ladye was
sufficient to feed their fancy. If then the wanton woer, whose
stay is but a rotten staffe, can so valiantly resist the Alarmes of
lust; may not a faythfull friende frie in friendship, and freese

in such filthy affection, be feruent in goodnesse, and cold in desire?
yes Amian and Ignatia: Auficlius and Canchia: Amador
and his Florinda, are sufficient proofes and presidences of
this chast league of loyall amitie, that we may well thinke, and
easilye perceiue this sacred bond of friendship betweene Florion
and Mamillia was altogether founded vpon vertue, and the
more it is to be credited, because hee had beene deceiued by the
lightnesse of one Luminia, and knew very well, that there was
litle cōstancy in such kites of Cressids kind, whose minds were
as foule within, as their faces faire without: he had been burnt
in the hand, for touching fire without aduisement: he had late enough
tasted of that baite, to bee taken in the trappe: he had bin
too sore canuased in the Nettes, to strike at euery stale: and hee
had trusted too much the shape of the body, to be so soone allured
with the 
                  •
               ewe of Beawtie: yea hee had beene so deepelye
drenched in the waues of womens wyles, that euery sodayne
sight was a sea of suspition, as he made a vowe in the waye of
martage to abandon the company of women for euer, and to a
solemne oath, since he had wonne againe the fieldes of his freedome,
neuer by the leawdnes of loue to enter into bondage. Yet
he would not altogether, (although hee had cause with Euripides
to proclaime himselfe open enemie to womankinde) seeme
so absurd a Sophister, to inferre a general conclusion of a particular
proposition, nor be counted so iniurious, to condemne al
of lightnesse, for ones leawdnes; nor to shewe himselfe such a
moodelesse Aminius, to say all were Criples, because he found
one halting: No, no, he knew all hearbes were not as bitter as
Coloquintida; that all water was not infectious, though some
were pestilent; that as there is a chāgable Polipe, so there is a
sted fast Emerauld, that there was as well a Lucrece, as a Lais;
as well Cornelia as Corinna; as constant a Penelope, as
a fleeting Phania; and as vertuous a Mamillia, as a vicious
Luminia: so that as he detested yt one for her folly, he imbraced
the other for her vertue: insomuch that hauing himself escaped
the seas of trouble and care, yet he thought his minde not fully
quiet, vntill he might cause his friend Mamillia, to cast her anker

in the port of Tranquilitie. For after that he had made a
Metamorphosis of himselfe from a Courtier of Venice, to a
Countriman in Sienna: from the waues of wickednes, to the
calme seas of Securitie: from the castle of Care, to the pallace
of pleasure: from the heath of Heauines, to the hauen of Happines:
yea, as he thought, from hel to heauē: yet he could not haue a
quiet conscience, til he might see her of the same sect, &amp; as deadly
to hate it, as he did loth it: so that he wrot her a letter, wherein
he counsayled her to follow his example, which shee hauing
receiued, and read, the force of his friendshippe, on the one side
so perswaded her, &amp; the rule of reason on the other side, so constrayned
her, that she concluded to abandon the Dukes Courte
for euer, and so eschewe the bayte wherein was hidde such a
deadly hooke, to abstaine from yt pleasure, which in time would
turne to poyson, to giue a final farewell to that condition of life,
which at length woulde breede her confusion. And therefore
hauing obtayned leaue of the Dutches, came home in haste to
her fathers house in Padua, where she had not remayned long,
beefore diuers young Gentlemen drawen by the passing prayse
of her perfection, which was bruted abroade through al the Citie,
repayred thither all in general, hoping to get the goale, &amp;
euery one particularly perswading himself to haue as much as
any, wherwith to deserue her loue: so yt there was no Feather,
no fangle, Gem nor Iewell, Ouch nor Ring left behinde, which
might make them seemely in her sight: yea some were so curious
no doubt, as many Italian Gentlemen are, which woulde
euen correct nature, where they thought shee was faultie in defect:
For their narrow shoulders must haue a quilted Dublet
of a large sise: their thinne belly must haue a coat of the Spanish
cut: their crooked legges, a fide sloppe; their smal shankes,
a bombast hose, and their dissembling mind, two faces in a hood:
to wax with the Moone, and ebbe with the sea: to beare both fire
and water, to laugh and weepe all with one winde.
            NOwe amongst all this courtly crew, which resorted to the
house of Gonsaga, there was a Gentleman, called Pharicles,
               
a youth of wonderfull witte, and no lesse wealth, whome
both nature and experience had taught the old prouerbe, as perfect
as his Pater noster, he that cannot dissemble, cannot lyue:
which sentence is so surely setled in the mindes of men, as it
may very wel be called in question, whether it belong vnto them
as an inseperable accident, or els is engrafted by nature, and so
fast bred by the bone, as it will neuer out: for they will haue the
cloath to be good, though the lyning be rotten ragges; and a
fine die, though a course thread: their wordes must be as smooth
as oyle, though their heartes be as rough as a rocke, and a smiling
countenaunce in a frowning minde. This Pharicles, I
say, fayre enough: but not faythful enough, a disease in men, I
will not say incurable, crauing altogether to croppe the buddes
of her outward beawtie, and not the fruites of her inward bountie;
forced rather by the lust of the body, then enticed by the loue
of her vertue; thought by the glose of his painted shew, to win
the substance of her perfect minde, vnder his side cloathes to couer
his clawes, with the cloake of curtesie to conceale his curiositie.
For as the birdes cannot be enticed to the trappe, but by
a stale of the same kind, so he knew well enough, that she, whose
minde was surely defenced with the rampire of honestie, must
of necessitie haue the onset giuen by ciuilitie. He therefore framing
a sheepes skin for his woolues backe, and putting on a
smooth hide ouer his Panthers panch, vsed first a great grauitie
in his apparell, and no lesse demurenes in his countenaunce and
gesture, with such a ciuil gouernmēt of his affection, as yt he seemed
rather to court vnto Diana, thē vow his seruice vnto Venus.
This Gentleman being thus set in order, wanted nothing
but opportunitie to reueale his minde to his new Mistresse, hoping
that if time would minister place and occasion, he would
so reclaime her with his faigned eloquence, as she should sease
vpō his lure, &amp; so cunningly cloake her with his counterfeit cal,
as she should come to his fist: for he thought himselfe not to haue
on al his armour, vnlesse he had teares at command, sighes, sobs,
prayers, protestations, vowes, pilgrimages, and a thousand false
othes to bind euery promise.
            
               
While thus he made his traine, Gonzaga, as his custome
was, once a yeere inuited all the youth of Padua to a banquet,
where, after they had taken repast, there was no talke but of the
beawtie of Mamillia, vntill euerye man tooke his Mistresse to
tread the measures.
            But shee knowing idlenesse to bee the nource of Loue,
and thinking him halfe madde, who fearing fire, woulde
put towe into the flame; or that doubting of drowning, would
swimme in the Sea; conueied her selfe closely from that wanton
company alone into a garden, intending by solitarinesse to
auoyd al inconuenience, as her presence among the lustie brutes
might haue procured. Pharicles, who now thought tyme and
place conuenient to discouer his minde, sat quite beside the saddle:
for perceiuiug the absence of his Mistresse, his heart was
in his hose, and he stoode, as if he had with Medusas head beene
turned to a stone. Thus nypped on the pate with this newe
mischaunce, he determined to returne home in hast to bewayle
his happe: but as nothing violent is permanent, so his sodaine
sore had a new salue. For as hee passed through the court, he
espied Mamillia, reading alone in the garden, whose sodaine
sight so reuiued his daunted mind, as that he paced vnto her, and
after he had curteously giuen her the Salue, interrupted her on
tis manner.
            Mistresse Mamillia, although my rashnes merit blame, in
presuming so farre to trouble your studye, yet the cause of my
boldnes deserueth pardon, sith it commeth of goodwill and affection:
For where the offence proceedeth of loue, there the
pardon ensueth of course: But if you thinke the faulte so
great, as remission cannot so easilye be graunted, I am heere
willing, that the heart which committed the cryme, shall suffer
the punishment due, and yeelde to bee your slaue for euer,
to kneele at your Shryne as a true seruaunt in parte of amendes.
            
               Mamillia hearinge the Gentlemanne in suche tearmes,
although somewhat abashed, payde him his debte in the same
coyne.
            
               
Maister Pharicles, although your sodaine ariuall did not
greatly hinder my study, I thinke it did not greatly profit your
selfe: so that your absence might haue more pleasured you, and
better contented me. And where you say the offence proceedeth
of good will and affection, I am not so madde to thinke, that
the hearb Sisimbrium wil sprout and sprigg to a great branch
in a momente: that the colde yron will burne at the sight
of the fire: but hee that will iuggle must playe his feates
vnder the boorde, or els his halting will be spied. And where in
recompence of your fault, you proffer your seruice, I will haue
no Gentlemen my seruaunts, vnlesse for their Liuery, I should
giue them a chaungeable suite: and therefore if your market be
ended, and your deuotion done, you haue as good leaue to goe,
as to come.
            
               Pharicles perceiuing the frumpe, as one that was maister of
his occupation, serued her againe of the same sauce.
            Gentlewoman, in that my ariual did not greatly hinder your
Muses▪ I thinke my fault so much the lesse: although proceeding
of your curtesie, rather then of my good happe: but if I
had knowne my absence might haue pleasured you, my presence
should not haue troubled your patience: and though the hearbe
Sisimbrium growes not to a great braunch in a moment, yet
the tallest blade of Spattania hath his 
                  •
               ull height in one momēt:
and if the Iron burneth not at the sight of the fire, yet the harde
stone Calcir, which can be bruised with no mettall, melteth with
the heate of the Sunne, and is resolued into licour. As for my
iuggling, if it may be spyed, it argueth the more good will, and
lesse deceite: so that if I halte, I am a starke lame Lazar, and
not a counterfeit Criple. For my Liuery, if I may be your seruaunt,
I passe not what couler it be, so it commeth of your profer,
and not of my desert. Thus, as I haue nowe begunne
my market with buying my bondage, and selling my freedome,
finding the ware I looked for, but the choyce so charye,
that no price will bee sette, hoping the champion will in
time make a chaung of his chaffer for my coyne, I humbly take
my leaue.
            
               
               Pharicles presently departing vnto his chamber, lefte Mamillia
stil in the garden, musing on the Gētlemans sodaine motion,
doubting whether his words were faithful or flattering, in
earnest or iest: so that somewhat scortched with the fire of fancie,
she entred with her selfe into this meditation.
            Ah Mamillia, what straunge alteration is this? what sodaine
change, what care chance? Shal they, who deemed thee a mirrour
of modestie, count thee a patterne of lightnes? shal thy staied
life be now cōpared to the Camoeleon that turneth himselfe
into the likenes of euery obiect: or likened to the Fullers Mill,
which euer waxeth worse and worse: to the hearbe Phanaces,
whose bud is sweete, and the fruite bitter: to the Rauens in Arabia,
which being young haue a pleasaunt voyce, and in their
age a horrible cry? Wilt thou consent vnto lust, in hoping to
loue? shall Cupid claime thee for his captiue, who euen nowe
wert vowed a 
                  •
               estall virgin? Shal thy tender age be more vertuous,

               ing, that yeeldeth
at the first shot; and that the bulwarke wanted but batterie, that
at the first parle becomes Prisoners? yes, yes, Mamillia, his
beauty argues inconstancy; and his filed phrases, 
                  ••
               ceite: and if
he see thee woo
                  •
                with a worde, hee will thinke thee lost with a

                  •
               ghtly to bee gained, is as quickly
lost. The hawke that commeth at the first cal, wil neuer be stedfast
on the stond: the Niesse that wil be reclaymed to the fist at yt
first sight of the lure, wil baite at euery bush: the woman ye wil
loue at the first looke, will neuer be charye of her choyse. Take
heede Mamillia, the finest scabberd hath not euer the brauest
blade; nor the goodliest chest hath not ye most gorgious treasure:
the bell with the best sound, hath an yron clapper: the fading apples
of Tantalus, haue a gallant shew, but if they be toucht, they
turne to Ashes: so a faire face may haue a foule minde: sweete
words, a sower heart: yea rotten bones out of a paynted Sepulchre:
for al is not gold that glysters. Why? but yet the Gem is

chosen by his hue, and the cloth by his colour: condemn not then
Mamillia, before thou hast cause: accuse not so strictly, without
tryall: search not so narrowly, till thou hast occasion of doubt.
Yea but the Mariners sound at the first, for feare of a rocke: the
surgion searcheth betimes, for his surest proofe: one forewit is
worth two after: it is good to beware, when the acte is done too
late commeth repentance. What? is it the beautie of Pharicles
that kindleth this flame? Who more beautifull then Iason? yet
who more false? for after Medea had yeelded, he sackt the forte,
and in lieu of her loue, killed her with kindnesse. Is it his wit?
who wyser then Theseus? yet none so traiterous. Beware Mamillia,
I haue heard them say, she that marries for beauty, for
euery dramme of pleasure, shall haue a pound of sorrow. Choose
by the eare, and not by the eye. Pharicles is fayre, so was Paris,
and yet fickle: he is wittie, so was Corsiris, and yet wauering.
No man knowes the nature of the hearbe by the outward shew,
but by the inwarde Iuyce, &amp; the operation consistes in the matter,
and not in the 
                  ••
               rme. Yea but why doe I stay at a straw, &amp;
skip ouer a blocke? Why am I curious at a Gnat, and let passe
an Elephant? his beauty is not it that moueth me, nor his wit y•
captayne which shall catch the castle, sith the one is momentary,
and the other may be impayred by sicknesse. Thy faith and
honestie, Pharicles, whereof all Padua speaketh, hath won my
heart, and so shall weare it: thy c
                  •
               uility without dissimulation,
thy fayth without fayning haue made theyr breach by loue, and
shall haue their entrance by law. Wel Mamillia, the common
people may erre, and that which is spoken of many, is not euer
true. Who so praysed in Rome of the common people &amp; Senat,
as Iugurth? yet a rebel. Who had more voyces in Carthage
then Aeneas? yet tryed a stragler: who in more credit with the
Romaines thē 
               Scipio Affricanus the great? yet at length foūd
halting. The Foxe wins the fauour of the lambes by play, and
then denoures them, so perhaps Pharicles shewes himselfe in
outward shew a demi God, whereas who tries him inwardely,
shall finde him but a solemne Saint. Why? all Padua speakes
of his honestie, yea but perchance he makes a vertue of his need,

and so layes this baulmed hooke of fayned honesty, as a luring
bayte to trappe some simple Dame. Why? can he be faithlesse
to one, that haue beene faithfull to all? The cloth is neuer tryed
till it come to the wearing: and the linnen neuer shrinkes, till
it comes to the wetting: so want of liberty to vse his will, may
make a restraint of his nature: and though hee vse faith and honestie
to make his marriage, yet she perhaps that shall try him,
shall either finde he neuer had them, or quite forgot them. For
the nature of men as I haue heard say, is like the Amber stone,
which will burne outwardly, and freese inwardly: and like the
Barke of the Myrtle tree, which growes in the mountaynes in
Armenia, that is, as hot as fire in the tast, and as colde as water
in the operation. The dogge byteth sorest: when hee doeth not
barke: the Onix is hottest when it lookes white, the Sirens
meane most mischiefe, when they sing: the Tyger then hideth
his crabbed countenance, when he meaneth to take his pray: and
a man doth most dissemble when he speakes fayrest. Try then,
Mamillia, ere thou trust; proue ere thou pu
                  •
                in practise, cast the
wa
                  •
               er ere thou appoynt the medicine, doe all thinges with deliberation,
goe as the snaile faire and softly, hast makes waste, the
maulce is euer sweetest, where the fire is softest. Let not wit ouercome
wisedome, nor fancie bee repugnant to faith, let
not the hope of an husbande be the hazard of thine honesty, cast
not thy credite in the chance of an other man, wade not too farre
where the foorde is vnknowen, rather bridle thy affections with
reason, and mortifie thy mynde with modesty, that as thou hast
kept thy virginitie inuiol
                  •
               te without spot, so thy choyse may be
without blemishe: know this, it is too late to call againe yesterday.
Therefore keepe the memory of Pharicles as needful, and
yet not necessary: like him when thou shalt haue occasion to
loue; and loue when thou hast tried him loyall: vntill then, remaine
indifferent.
            When Mamillia had vttered these worde, she went out of the
garden priuily into her closet, and there to auoyde the inconuenience
which might haue ensued of those foolish cogitations, called
an old Gentlewoman, which was her nurse named Madam

               Castilla, to beare her company: a Gentlewoman, whose life and
yeeres were so correspondent, as for her honestie shee might
haue tryed the daunger of Dianas caue: So they two together
passe the time in honest and mery talke, vntill all the guestes of
Gonzaga had taken their leaue, and departed.
            But Pharicles, who all this while had a flea in his eare, &amp; his
combe cut with the taunting quippes of his Mistresse, as his
fire was the more, his flame was the greater, and not being able
so well to rule his lust, as she to bridle her loue, vsed himself for
a secretarie, with whome to participate his passions, knowing
that it were a poynt of meere folly to trust a friend in loue, sith
Ouid in his booke de Arte amand
                     •
                  , had forbidden that, as principal,
and perceiuing very wel, that in such matters two might
best keepe counsaile where one was away: entred into these
tearmes with himselfe.
            O Pharicles, Pharicles, now thou findest it true, which earst
thou countest for a fable, that so long the Flie dalies in the flame
that at length she is burnt, yt the birdes Halciones vēter so long
in the waues, that at last they are drowned; that so longe the
pitcher goeth to the brooke, as in tyme it comes broken home:
so thou which warming thy fancy at euery flame, and venturing
thy selfe at euery waue, art at last burnt with beawtie,
and drowning in desire, as it standes in hazard, that either thou
returne home broken, or halfe crased. Nowe thou seest
venturing, if it bee token of witte, yet is it no signe of wisdome,
and that timiditie in loue is a vertue. Nowe hast
thou founde Phocas precept to bee fruitefull, that a Louer
shoulde proceede in his suite, as the Crabbe, whose pace is euer
backwarde, that though loue bee like the Adamant, which
hath vertue to draw: yet thou shouldest be sprinckled with goats
blood, which resisteth his operation: that though the face of
some fayre dame hath power to incense thy minde, yet thou
shouldest take the hearb Lupinar to coole desire. But Pharicles,
if thou beest taken, it is no meruaile, if thou beest hurt, it
is no pittie: for the Minow that is euer nibbling, and neuer byting,
will at length be hanged on the hooke. Thou which didst

accuse so currishly all women of lightnes in loue, shalt perhaps
now condemne thy selfe of leawdnes in lyfe: and thou which in
thy choyce wert counted captious, shalt try thy selfe not to be
so curious. What Gentlewoman in all Padua was there eyther
so fayre or honest, whose beautie or vertue thou didst not
deeme light, esteeming them eyther vnmeete for thee, or thy
selfe vnfitte for them: so that eyther thou couldest sooth her with
a trumpe, or els lay a loading carde on her backe, should wey a
scoffe? and nowe thou art like to be serued of the same sauce:
which, if it happen, those whome you vsed for a sporte, will
eyther thinke thou didst not know thy descant, or els crosse thee
for a foole. Why, Pharicles? wilt thou be a preacher? who
is so guiltie as he that accuseth himselfe? if thou hast committed
the crime, yet let an other finde the faulte. It is a fowle
birde defiles the own neast, construe al thinges to the best, turne
the stearne the best waye: yea, and if thou haste troden thy
shooe awry, it is but a poynt of youth, leaue such foolish examinations
of thy crased conscience. Mamillia, yea Mamillia, Pharicles
is the marke thou must shoote at: her beautie is the goale
thou must seeke to get: her fayre face, her golden lockes her coral
cheekes: to conclude, her christall corps shadowed ouer with
a heauenly glasse: surpassing beautie is the Syren, whose songe
hath enchanted thee, and the Circes cuppe, which hath so sotted
thy senses, as either thou must with Vlysses haue a speedy remedie,
or els remayne transformed. She hath the power to bynd
and loose: her comelinesse is the comfortable collise to cure thy
care, her perfection is the lenitiue plaister, must mitigate thy
payne: her beauty is like the hearbe Phanaces, whiche reuiueth
the dead carcasse. Ah Pharicles is the foundation of thy faith fixed
vpon her feature? consider with thy selfe, beauty is but a blossome,
whose flower is nipped with euery frost, it is like ye grasse
in India, which is withered before it springeth: what is more
fayre? yet what more fading? What more delighthfull, yet
nothing more deadlye? what more pleasaunte? and what more
perillous? Beautie may wel be compared to the Bathes in Calicut,
whose streames flow as cleere as the floods of Padus, and
whose operation is as pestilent as the riuer Orme. What Pharicles,
               
wilt thou become a precise Pythagoras in renouncing
of loue, or a teastie Tianeus in dispraysing of beauty? What
more cleere then the Cristall? and what more precious? What
more comely then cloth of Arras? so what more coastly? what
creature so beautifull as a woman, and what more estimable? is
not the Diamond of greatest dignity, that is most glistering?
and the pearle thought most precious, that is most perfect in colour?
Aristotle saith, he cannot be counted happy, although hee
had al the vertues, if he want beauty: yea Appollonius an Archheretike,
and professed enemie against the sacred lawes of beauty,
is driuen both by the lawes of nature and nurture, to confesse
that vertue is so much the more acceptable, by howe muche the
more it is placed in a beautifull body. Therefore Pharicles recant,
as perceiuing thine owne folly, and make amends to beauty,
as guilty of blasphemy: for by dispraise thou shalte reape reuenge,
and by praise in hazard to atchieue thy purpose. Cineas
the Philosopher was of this opinion, that when the Gods framed
beauty, they went beyond their skill, in that the maker was
subiect to the thing made: for none so wise, but beauty hath bewitched:
none so sober but beauty hath besotted: none so valiant,
but beauty hath byn victor: yea euen the Gods themselues haue
geuen beauty the superiority as a thing of more force then they
were able to resist.
            Well Pharicles, sith beauty is the price for which thou meanest
to venture, vse no delay, for feare of danger: let no fonde reasons
perswade thy setled minde, let not the preceptes of Philosophy
subuert the will of nature, youth must haue his course, hee
that will not loue when he is young, shal not be loued when he
is olde. Spare no cost, nor be not afrayde of words: for they are
as winde, they which are most coy at the first, are most cōstant at
the last. What a cold cōfect had the Lord Mendozza, at y• Dutches
of Sauoyes hand? Prictor at his Coluida, &amp; Horatius at
his Curiatia? So though Mamillia were something short in her
answeres, it signifieth the greater affection, though she made it
strange at the first, she wil not be strait at the last: y• greatest offer

hath but a small denyall. Well, to conclude, I am fully resolued
in my selfe, eyther to winne the spurres, or loose the horse:
to haue ye blossome, or lose ye fruite: to enioy the beautie of Mamillia,
or els to ieopard a ioynt. And therefore whatsoeuer learning
willes, I will consent vnto Nature: for the best clarkes
are not euer the wisest men: whatsoeuer the lawes of Philosophy
perswade me, I will at this time giue the raynes of libertie
to my amorous passions: for he that makes curiositie in loue, wil
so long straine curtesie, that either he wil be counted a solemne
sutor, or a witlesse wooer: therefore whatsoeuer the chaunce be,
I wil cast at all.
            
               Pharicles hauing thus made an end, stood in a mase with him
selfe, not that it did proceede from any sincere affection, enforced
by her vertue: but that his mind was set vpon lust, enflamed by
her bewtie.
            Which disease I doubt nowadayes reignes in many Italian
gentlemen. Whether it be that Mercurie is Lord of their birth,
or some other peeuish planet predominant in the calculation of
their natiuitie, I know not: but this I am sure, that theyr rype
wittes are so soone ouershadowed with vice, and their senses so
blinded with self loue, that they make their choyce so farre without
skill, as they proue them selues but euill chapmen: for if she
be faire, they thinke her faithfull: if her bodye be endued with
bewtie, they iudge she cannot but be vertuous. They are so bli
                  •
               
               ded
with the visor of Venus and conceite of Cupid, as they
think all birdes with white fethers to be simple Doues: euery
seemely Sappho, to be a ciuill Salona: euery Lais, to bee a loyall
Lucrece: euery chatting maydē to be a chast matrone. These
are such as chose for lust, and not for loue; as marry the bodye,
and not the mind: so that as soone as the beautie fo their Mistres
be vaded, their loue is also quight extinguished. But againe to
the purpose.
            As thus, I say, Pharicles had well eased his minde with this
last meditation, because his loue was but a lose kind of likinge,
and the fire of his fancie such a flender flame, as the least mislyking
showre of shrewd fortune would quite quench it: therfore

he had neither care of his choyce, nor feare of his chaunge: but
onely fed his fancy with the hope of hauing Mamillia: and rested
vpon this poynt, till eyther occasion or place should serue to
offer his seruice.
            In the meane time Gonzaga perceiuing his daughter to be
mariageable, knowing by skill and experience, that the grasse
being ready for the sieth, would wither if it were not cut; and
the apples beeing rype, for want of plucking woulde rotte on
the tree; that his daughter beeing at the age of twentie yeeres,
would either fall into the greene sicknes for want of a husband,
or els if she scaped that disease, incurre a farther inconuenience:
so that lyke a wise father he thought to foresee such daungers.
And deuisinge with himselfe where hee might haue a meete
match for his Daughter, thought none so fit as Pharicles,
who I say by his crafty cloaking, had wonne the hearts of al the
Gentlemen of Padua. Therefore first intending to knowe
whether his Daughter could fancy the Gentleman, before hee
should breake the matter vnto him, &amp; yet if he doubting he should
moue the question, she might conceiue some hope of libertie, and
so strayne vpon her owne choyce, went vnto Madam Castilla
her nourse, desiring her to moue the motion to his daughter,
as concerning Pharicles, &amp; that the next day she should tell him
his aunswere. Madam Castilla easily graunted: and departing
frō 
               Gonzaga, went vnto the chamber of Mamillia, where
she found her solemnly sitting in secrete meditation, vpon the
cōtēts of a Letter, which not half an houre before was sent vnto
her from her old friend Florion, the tenure whereof was this.
            
               
                  Dan Florion of Sienna, to
Mamillia in Padua.
                  
                     MIstresse Mamillia, the extreame pleasure I
conceiue of your sodaine and certaine departure
from the Dukes court vnto Padua,
forced me to send you this letter, as a perfect
token of my ioy, and your good happe, both
thinking my selfe in some credit with you,

that my perswasions preuailed: and likewise iudging you to bee
wise, in that you both auoyd daunger, and prouide for a storme:
for it is a great vertue, saieth the Poet, to abstaine from pleasure.
The courtly life, saith Agrippa, is a glistering miserie:
for what more pleasaunt outwardly, and what more perilous inwardly?
what more delightful to the body? what more deadly to
the minde? there is the substance of vice, with the vaile of vertue,
there is bondage in the shape of licencious libertie, and care clad
in a masking coat. Happy, yea thrise happy art thou Mamillia,
whose wisdōe hath not bin inueigled by wit, nor whose wil hath
not bin enforced by wilfulnes: for in obeying the one, thou hast
scaped danger, &amp; in resisting of the other, thou hast won same.
Yea, but the gold, saith some, is tried in the fire, and the ore is
put into the furnace. It is more honour to keepe the forte being
assayled, then not besieged: so the credit of a Gentlewoman is
more, to be honest in the court, then in the countrey, and it purchaseth
more fame to kneele with a chast minde at the shrine of
Venus, then at the altar of Vesta. Mamillia, so many heades, so
many wits. I speake by experience. The house is more in dāger
of fire that is thatched with straw, then y• which is couered with
stone: he is more in danger of drowning, that sayles in the Sea,
then he which rides on the land. What maketh the theef, but his
pray? what entiseth the fish, but the baite? what calleth the byrde,
but the scrappe? what reclaimeth the hawke
                        •
                      but the lure? The
court. Mamillia, is y• whetston of lust, the baite of vanity, the call
of Cupid: yea the vtter enimy to virginity: so that in as much as
virginity is to be esteemed, so much the Dukes court is to be eschewed.
But I heare thou art at home with thy father in Padua,
&amp; that there is great resort of Gentlemē to craue thee in marriage:
take counsel, Mamillia, at him which hath bought it. If thou
hast taken care to keepe thy virginity inuiolable, as thy greatest
treasure: so take both heede and time in bestowing the same as a
most precious Iewel. Respect not his beauty, without vertue:
for it is like a ring in a swynes snoute: esteeme not his wealth
without wit, nor his riches without reason; for then thou shalt either
choose a fayre Inne with a foule hostesse; or wed thy self to a

woodden picture with a golden coate. Regarde not his byrth,
without bountie: for it wil euer procure statelinesse. Beware of
hot loue, Mamillia, for the greatest flowe hath the soonest ebbe:
the sorest tempest hath the most sodaine calme: y• hottest loue hath
the coldest end: and of the deepest desire oftentimes ensueth the
deadliest hate. But why doe I deale so doultishly to exhort thee,
which hast no neede of such perswasion, &amp; sith I both haue heard,
&amp; I my selfe know thy mynde so grafted in vertue, y• thou wilt
neither like so lightly, nor wauer so lewdly: but either make thy
match wel, or els stand to thy choyce? For she that wil falsifie her
faith to one, will crack her credit for al. Therfore least I should
be tedious, or vrge that which is not needfull, I referre the rest
to your discretion, desiring you to do my commendations to the
rest of my friendes. And so farewell.
                  
                     Yours in a chast mynd,
Dan Florion.
                  
               
            
            
               AFter that Mamillia had read this Letter to
Madame Castilla, they fel in discourse of the
vertu
                  •
               us disposition of Florion, who beeing
of tender yeeres, which are subiect vnto lust;
was euer a professed enimie to Loue: yea the
painted face of Beauty coulde neuer haue power
to enchant his vertue, he had already wel
tyed himselfe to the mast of modesty, to keepe him from the Sirens
songs of beastly vanity, and had sufficiently defensed his
minde with the rampyre of honesty, against the laseiuious cuppe
of Circes sorcerie; that as other Gentlemen of Italy had sworne
themselues true subiects to the crowne of Cupid: so hee had
vowed himselfe a professed souldier, to march vnder the ensigne
of Uertue.
            These few words past betweene them, of the good and godlie
nature of the Gentleman: Madame Castilla, as the Mistresse of
her arte, beganne to take occasion of talke with Mamillia, by
the con

               ents of Florions behest: if she should haue abruptly sifted

her, her deuise shold be spied: &amp; so perchance not haue an answer
agreeable to his demand: therfore she cried her on this maner.
            Mistresse Mamillia, the contentes of your friende Florions
Letter shewes, that eyther the constellation of the starres, the
disposition of the Planets, or y• decree of the destinies, or force of
the fates were contrary in y• houre of his byrth, or els it is not alwayes
true, that youth is prone vnto vice; or that tender yeeres
cannot be without wanton conditions: for there is none more
witty, and yet few lesse wilfull: none so curteous, yet few lesse
curious: as his nature seemes very precious, and yet very perillous:
euē like the patient, which by ouer much blood falleth into
the Plurisie: the glasse, the more fine it is, the more brittle: the

wearing: the Margaret is of great valure, yet soonest broken: y•
Muske is most strong in sauour, yet endureth but a smal time: so

much y• more it is to be doubted: and yet the byrds that breede in
Bohemia, are of the same colour in their age, that they were

               ors I meane, which although I maruel at for the loosenes,
yet I am glad of it, if they be woorth the welcomming. Mamillia,
my gray haires, which in respect of my reuerend age should
somewhat preuaile to procure some coūtenance and credit with
you, my long continuance and familiarity in your company, my
paynes I tooke with you in your swadling clothes, my care in
your youth to nourishe you in vertue, and my ioy in your rype

age to see you addicted to the same, are of force sufficient, I hope
to procure you to be somewhat ruled by my talke: which if you
shal doe, I shal thinke my labour wel bestowed, and my time and
trauell well spent.
            
               Florion, Mamillia, writeth to you of marriage, which if it
commeth of his owne coniecture, and no report, he proueth himselfe
a subtill sophister, meaning vnder the colour of an vncertaine
rumour, to perswade you to a most stayed and stedfast state
of life, as one knowing very well, that as nothing is more commendable
then virginitie: so nothing is more honourable than
matrimonie. And I my selfe, Mamillia, which once a wife, and
now a widdow, doe speake by experience, that though virginitie
is pleasant, yet marriage is more delightfull. For in the first
creation of the world, God made not Adam and Eua single virgins,
but ioyned couples: so y• virginitie is profitable to one, but
marriage is profitable to many. Whether is ye vine more regarded
that beareth grapes, or ye Ash that hath nothing but leaues?
The Deere that encreaseth the park, or the barren Doe? Whether
is the hoppe tree more esteemed, that rots on the grounde,
than that which clasping the pole, creepeth vp, &amp; bringeth foorth
fruite? What, Mamillia, as virginity is fayre and beautifull: so
what by course of kind is more vnseemely, then an old wrinckled
maide? what is more pleasaunt to the sight, then a Smaragde,
yet what lesse profitable, if it be not vsed? What more delightful
to the eyes, then the colour of good wine; yet what of lesse value
if it cannot be tasted? There is nothing more faire thē the Phoenix,
yet nothing lesse necessary, because she is single. Yea, euen
the law of nature, Mamillia, wisheth society, and detesteth solitarinesse.
Whether euen in thine owne iudgement, Mamillia,
if thou hadst a goodly orcharde, wouldest thou wish nothing but
blossomes to grow continually; or the blossomes to fade, and the
trees to be fraught with pleasāt fruit? Whether doest thou think
the ruddy Rose, which withereth in the hand of a man, delighting
both sight and smelling, more happie than that which fadeth
on the stalke without profit? Whether hath the wine better luck
which is drunken, than that which standing still, is turned to vineger?

And yet, Mamillia, I graunt too muche: for a womans
beauty decayes not with marriage, but rather commeth then to
the flower and perfection. But as I doe perswade thee to marriage,
so would I wish thee to change for the better, or els keepe
thy chance still: I meane, I would haue him that shoulde match
with thee, to bee suche a one, in whose society thou shouldest not
count mariage a bondage, but a freedom; not a knot of restraint,
but a band of liberty, one whom thou shouldest like for his beauty,
and loue for his vertue; I would haue him to want no wealth,
and yet to be wise, and with his wisedome to haue all kynde of
ciuility.
            Now, Mamillia, as I haue spoken in general, so I wil touch
the particular. I meane to shew thereof one, which I woulde
wish to be thy husband, and thee to be his wife. Pharicles it is,
to be flat with thee, whose beauty &amp; honesty hath amased all Venice,
whose order of lyuing may be, and hath been a perfect platforme
and methode of ciuil dealing, and honest behauiour: thee,
Mamillia, I wish to be his mate for his curtesie: and him to be
thy match but in constancie. The Gemme which is gallaunt in
colour, and perfect in vertue, is the more pretious; thē hearbe,
which hath a faire bark, and a sweete sappe, is the more to bee esteemed;
the Panther with his paynted skin and his sweet breath
is the more delighted: so Pharicles faire in face, and faithfull in
his heart; pleasant in his countenance, and perfect in his mind;
is so much the more to be imbraced. If ye Ore, Mamillia, which
is drosse outwardly, and gold inwardly, be of great price: what
then is the pure mettal? if the rough stone with a secret vertue, is
of value: what is it then, being polished? If a smooth &amp; learned
style in an ill print, importes some credit: what doth that which
commeth out of a perfect presse? so Mamillia, if a man which is
deformed in body, and reformed in minde, may deserue great liking:
what deserues he, which is both bountifull, and beautiful?
If a crooked carkasse, and an honest nature merite commendation:
what doth he then, which is both faire &amp; faithful? If a disfigured
body, with honest conditions, wins fauour: what thē doth
a comely coūtenance, with a curteous mynd? Al these perfectiōs

by nature, Mamillia, are incident to Pharicles: y• he can neyther
be appeached of want, nor condemned of lacke, neyther his
person nor mind in any wise misliked.
            Now Mamillia, conster of my wordes, as you please, &amp; like
where you loue, so that I may neither repent my talke, nor you
curse my counsell.
            
               Mamillia, Gentlemen, was driuen into such a maze with this
sodaine motion of Madam Castilla, that she stood, as though her
heart had bin on her halfepēny, fearing the fetch of her old nurse,
doubting what a fleeue she shoulde shape for the coate, least shee
should be ouertaken in misliking so lightly: or (though not very
chary of her choyse) in choosing so quickly: therefore she framed
her answere betweene both on this maner.
            MAdam, if I stand in a mase which haue the harme, thinke it
not strange, sith you maruel, which are not toucht. For I
may more muse of the rumour which know it contrary: than
you, which doe but call it in question. But if Florion haue heard
a lye, and you beleeue it: it is not my fault, but your lightnesse of
credit: and therefore construe of it how you can: for I am at a
good poynt. Old women wil quickly conceiue, &amp; soone beleeue:
for age is as credulous, as suspitious; the dried oake wil sooner
fire, than the greene Ashe; &amp; olde ragges wil sooner burne, than
new linnen; the green apple is hard to pearce, when the old fruit
wil quickly bruse: so age though they be slow in hearing, yet they
are swifter in beleeuing then youth, that the least sparke of suspitiousnesse,
wil fire their whole brayne. And therefore he that
knoweth their fault, &amp; wil not beare with it, is much too blame.
Whereas you draw your perswasiōs for my credite, of your talk
from your gray haires, it sheweth surely but a greene wit, not
so ful of grauity, as either your age or yeeres requires: For thē
your reasons would haue tended to ciuility, &amp; not to sensuality,
to vertue, &amp; not to vanity. Your paines you tooke with me in my
swadling cloathes, your care in my youth to nurse me in vertue,
and your ioy in my ripe yeeres to see mee addicted to the same,
shewes by the end that your care was but slender, &amp; your ioy fained.
The Cowe which giueth good store of mylke, &amp; spilleth it

with her foote, is as much to be blamed for the losse, as to be cō
               mended
for the giftt. The water which for a time beareth ye vessel,
&amp; at last with the waues ouerwhelmeth the same, doth more
harme in drowning the Barke, then good in bearing it. The hū
               ter
which trayneth the hounde being young, truely to cal vpon
the sente, is much too blame to beate him from it being olde: so
you Madam, are more to be blamed for perswading me to matrimonie,
than you were before to be commended, for exhorting
me to virginity: for in my tender age my infancie was not able
to receiue your counsell, and then you tolde me howe greatly I
ought to esteeme virginity: and nowe in my rype yeeres, when
I can conceiue your meaning, you wish me vtterly to forsake it:
either then sure you were in a wrong opinion, or els nowe in an
errour, but howsoeuer it was, my mind is setled. Uirginity you
say is delightful, yet matrimony more pleasant: Virginity you
put in the positiue, but matrimonie in the superlatiue. Well, I
pray God you make not marriage so farre to exceed in comparison,
that at last it growe to an extremitie. But as your age is
much giuen to the shaking palsey: so I thinke your argumentes
haue a spice of the same disease: for their foundation is but fickle,
&amp; therfore the lesse worth to be taken at ye hardest. The tal Cedar
that beareth only bare blossoms, is of more value then the apple
tree that is laden with fruite: the keeper (for all your saying)
makes more account of a barren Doe, than of a bearing hynde.
Diana shal obtaine more same for her chastity in the hunting of ye
woods, than Venus for her lasciuious honestye in playing with
Mars in her bed. Uirginity shalbe esteemed as a rare &amp; precious
iewel, whē marriage shalbe counted but a custome. The baytree
growing single by it self, flourisheth greene; whereas being clasped
with the yuie, it withereth: ye gold of it self hath a gallāt hue,
but being touched, it changeth colour: the Saphyre stone clasped
in mettal, looseth his vertue: so a virgin being once married, withereth
straight, changeth colour, and looseth her chiefest treasure.
And though you say by course of kind that nothing is more
vnseemely then an olde wrinckled mayde: yet experience teacheth
vs, that nothing is more vnlikely than an olde withered

wife. The Rose dying on the stalke, seemeth in better state then
that which fadeth, being pluckt: the grasse looketh better being
vncut, then that which withereth with the sieth: for the one fadeth
by course of nature; and the other by kinde of imperfection.
The Phenix being seldome seene, the more desired; the rarer
the Gemme is, the more esteemed. The stones of Arabia because
they be straunge, are of greatest price: so virginitie, by so
much the more is to be regarded, by how much it is more rare
then mariage: for the one commeth by speciall grace, and the
other by common course. Uirginitie among the Romanes was
had in such admiration and estimation, that if by chaunce the
Uestal virgins walked abroad, the Senators would giue them
the vpper hand, and all the officers shew them due reuerence.
            
               Cybil the mother of the Gods, was a virgin: and Minerua was
famous for three thinges; strength, wisdome, and virginitie.
            The wise woman which gaue Oracles at Delphos, was a virgin,
being alwayes called Pythia. Uirginitie alters the nature
of wilde beastes: for the Lyons neuer hurt a pure Uirgin:
and Pliny reporteth that the Unicorne will sleepe on a
virgins lappe. Therefore Madame, your argumentes rather
importe rule, than reason; and seemes to come from a greene
witte, not from a gray head: but though the fowle haue fayre
feathers, he may haue rancke flesh; the fish may haue glistering
skales without, and yet be rotten within: so your outwarde
shew of grauitie, may inwardly be addicted to vanitie, and old
folke are twise children: and perhappes though your face bee
wrinckeled, your minde is youthfull; though your yeeres
and calling argue chastitie, yet you had as leefe haue husbande,
as wishe mee marryed: and I promise you for my
parte,
I had rather you shoulde eate of the meate, then I
taste of the sauce: if it be not a knot of bondage, but a band of libertie,
I would haue you once againe try that freedome. But
sure eyther you know more then all, or els say more then you
know: for not onely the common people, but also the most learned
hath thought maryage to be such a restraint of libertie, as it
feeleth no sparke of freedome: for both the body is giuen as a

slaue vnto the will of an other man, and the minde is subiecte to
sorow and bound in the caue of care: so that euen the name of a
wife importes a thousand troubles. If you call this libertie, I
know not what bondage is. Who so is addicted to maryage,
findeth it easie but in one respect, and that is, if she chaunce on a
good husband, which indeede you brauely set out in his colours.
But so did Aristotle his happy man; Tully, his Orator, Plato
his common Wealth, and in our countreye heere, one of
my kinsmen sets out the liuely Image of a Courtier. But as
these spoke of such, but could neuer finde them: so you haue described
such a husband, as can neuer be heard of. Yet, Madame,
you go further: for the others spoke in generall, and you for the
better confirmation of your reason, inferre a particular, and that
is Pharicles, whom indeed I confesse to haue in outward shew,
as good qualities as any in all Italy. But the hearbe, though it
haue a fayre hue, and a sweete sappe, yet being tasted, it may be
infectious. The Panther with his paynted skinne and sweete
breath, hath a tyrannous heart: so Pharicles may bee as foule
within, as faire without; and if he be not, he digresseth from his
kind: for these Gentlewomen which haue trusted to the beautie
of the face, haue beene deceiued with the deformitie of the mind.
Theseus, Demophoon, Aeneas, Iason, and Hercules, were
both famous for their feature and fortitude, and renoumed for
their inuincible valure, and yet they wanne not so much fame for
their prowes in warre, as shame for their inconstancy in loue:
he that chooseth an apple by the skinne, and a man by his face,
may be deceiued in the one, and ouershot in the other. Therefore
Madame, sith both mariage is troublesome, and the choyce so
doubtfull, I meane not to proue the care, nor try the chance, but
remaine a virgin still. Yet thus much to your question, if my
minde should change to try such happe, I would welcome Pharicles,
as well as any other.
            Madame Castilla hearing this ouerthwartnes of Mamillia,
was driuen into a great mase, to see the Gentlewoman so hoat
with her: in so much ye as old women are soone angry, she tooke
pepper in the nose at the sharpe reply, and therefore framed her
as quicke an answere.
            
               
               MAmillia, quoth she, if the Phisitions rubbe the soare, the patient
must needes sturre; touch a galled horse, and he will
winch: so your hotte answere shewes my question toucht you in
the quicke; and that though you make so straunge with maryage,
yet if your choyce were in your owne handes, you woulde
giue a finall farewell to virginitie. But the Fox will eate no
grapes: and you will not marry, because you may, or perhappes
do loue, where your friendes wil not like, and your wish should
be contrary to their will. Sirichia the Daughter of Smald king
of the Danes, could not be perswaded by her father to forsake
her virginitie, but the third day after his death, she was betroathed
but to a meane Squire: Manlia Daughter of Mauritius
was so scrupulous of her virginitie, that she altogether abandoned
the company of wiues and widdowes, and yet at length
she tooke an husband, and was so kinde harted, that she woulde
not sticke to sell large peniworths of her honestie. Mamillia,
I will not make comparisons, because they be odious, nor infer
any conclusions, for feare of farther daunger. But take this by
the way, that he which couers a small sparke in the ashes, will
procure a great flame. And with this she departed, as halfe angry,
leauing Mamillia very sorowfull that she had displeased
her old nource, and very carefull for the yssue of her new loue:
yet, as much as she could dissembling the matter, she past away
the day in mery company.
            But all this while Pharicles had a flea in his eare, and a
thorne in his foote, which procured him little rest. For as the
wounded Deare stayes in no place: so the passionat louer staies
but without stedfastnes, neuer hauing a quiet minde: for if hee
sayle, Loue is his Pylot: if he walke, Loue is his companion:
if he sleepe, Loue is his pillow: so that alwayes he hath the spur
in his side, to procure his disquiet, hauing no salue for his soare,
vnlesse he reap remedy at y• hands of his aduersary, which Pharicles
tryed true. For there passed no houre after his departure
from Mamillia, in which a thousand cares did not clogge his
combred minde: for the thought of her sharpe answere was hard
to disgest in his crased stomacke: then that her father and he was

of no great acquaintaunce, which was a cause of his long absence.
Howe if fortune so fauoured, that he gayned her goodwill?
yet hee lost his owne freedome, and that was but a signe
of an yll chapmanne: Howe oftentimes they, which sued to
marrye in haste, did finde sufficient time to repent them at leasure?
            And surely Gentlemen, if Pharicles had rested on this point,
in my iudgement he had hit the marke: for there is no such hinderaunce
to a man, as a wife: if respecting warre, Darius and
Methridates are witnesses: of learning and Philosophy, Socrates
comes in as plaintife: so in my opiniō, if men would neuer
marry, they should neuer be marred: and if they would neuer
haue a wife, they should alwayes want strife: for she is that
burden that Christ onely refused to take from mens shoulders:
yea some haue called a wife, a heauy Crosse, as a mery iesting
Gentleman of Venice did: who hearing the preacher command
euery man to take vp his Crosse, and follow him hastily, tooke
his wife on his shoulders, &amp; said he was ready with the formost:
but least in talking of crosses, I be crost for a foole in going
beyonde my commission, againe to Pharicles: who though perhappes
hee read these, or suche like examples, yet his hot loue
warmed his affection: so whatsoeuer he mused in his minde, it
would not abate his deuotion, but still sought sundry meanes to
breake to his Saynt: and yet the farder he went, the more hee
was from his purpose, that he had past the Caue of care, ready to
enter into the dungeon of despayre, if fortune had not fauoured
his chaunce. For flinging out of his studie, to auoyde this
melancholy, hee went to take ayre in the fieldes, where, by good
happe, hee espyed his Mystresse walking with her nurce to a
graynge place, amyldes distance from Padua, to beare certaine
Gentlewomen company, which resorted thither to visit a sicke
patient, at which place was also Signior Gonsaga, with other
Gentlemen.
            Now if Pharicles was dryuen into an extasie, with the extreame
pleasure he conceiued by the sodayne sight of his Goddesse,
it is no metuaile, sith her absence was the hazarde of his

life, and her presence his onely pleasure: and I think, if I may
enter into a womans thought, without offēce, Mamillia would
not haue wished a fitter companyon to shorten her iourney: yet
she passed on without any semblance of his sight: whereas feare
and necessitie had a deadly combate in the minde of Pharicles,
he doubted if he should be ouer bold, he might spill his pottage.
But the law of necessitie, saith Plato, is so hard, that y• Gods thē
selues are not able to resist it. For as the water, by nature cold,
is made hotte by the force of the fire: and the straight tree pressed
downe, growes alwayes crooked: so nature is subiect to necessitie,
that kind cannot haue his course. The litle Mouse, by nature
fearefull, in daunger is desperate: the Boore in safetie is
timorous, in perril without feare: the Coward in peace dreadeth
the sight of the weapon, whereas being vrged by necessitie, hee
passeth the pikes.
            
               Ormaus the Sonne of kinge Cirus, by nature was borne
dumbe, yet when the Citie Suzes was taken, seeing a souldier
ready to kill his owne Father, cryed out, villayne, saue the
crowne: so that necessitie in him supplyed a want of nature.
And if there bee any thing, which is more forcible then necessitie,
it is the lawe of Loue, which so incensed Pharicles, that
casting all feare aside, hee offred him selfe to his Mistres, with
this courteous parle.
            GEntlewoman, if I boldly offer my selfe, as a Copartner
of your voyage, which am a companyon farre vnfitte for
such a company, pardon my fault, sith it commeth of force, and
condemne not my nature of want of nurture; but let your bewtie
beare the blame, as the spurre of my rash enterprise: For the
Adamant drawes by vertue, though Iron striue by nature: wher
force is: there the fault is forgiuen. But if in any wise my seruice
might pleasure you, or rather not offend you, I would proffer
it, if I knew it would be but halfe so well accepted, as hartily
offred: but perhaps it wil not be worth the wearing, beecause
proffered chaffer stinckes.
            Madame Castilla hearing the curtesie of the Gentlemanne,
and perceiuing what Sainte hee serued, to encourage him the

more, gaue him this gentle answere, fit for his friendly offer.
            GEntleman, quoth she, we neither can thinke ill of your nurture,
nor yet mislike your nature, sith the one argues curtesie,
and the other smal curiositye; vnlesse it bee in making your
arriuall so strange, &amp; accusing your conscience as guilty, which
no mā finds fault with: for my part, Sir, &amp; I think I may speak
for Mamillia, you are not so soone come, as welcome, nor your
seruice is not more heartily offered, then willingly accepted: &amp;
therefore, if you be content with your happe, wee are very well
pleased with the chaunce.
            And with that she fel in talke with the rest of the company,
to the ende Pharicles might vse some speaches to Mamillia:
who now seeing the coast cleere, and time and place fitte for the
purpose, gaue her the onset in this manner.
            MIstres Mamillia, it hath byn a saying more common then
true, that loue makes al men Orators, yet I my selfe finde
it contrary by experience, insomuch that I thinke the perfect louer
wants not onely Eloquence, but hath a restraint of his nature.
The water pot being filled to the brim, yeeldes no licour,
though hauing a hundred holes. The wine vessel beyng ful, lets
passe no wine, though neuer so wel vented. The colour ioyned
hard to the sight, hindreth the sense. The flower put into y• nose-thril,
stoppeth y• smelling. The louer in y• presence of his Lady,
at y• first is eyther driuen into an extasie for ioy, or els into a quaking
traūce for feare: so that, when he should plead his cause, his
wits are either bewitched, or els not at home: &amp; if it happen his
tongue be not tied, in many words lies mistrust; and in paynted
speech, deceit is most oftē couered, &amp; specially, where either acquaintance
or long continuance hath bred no credit. Therfore I
Mistres Mamillia, whose acquaintance with you is smal, &amp; credit
lesse, dare vse no circumstance, for feare of mistrust, neither cā
I tel in what respect to bring a sufficient triall, or proofe of my
goodwil: but only that I wish the end of my loue to be suche, as
my faith and loyalty, is at this present, whiche I hope tract of
time shal try without spot.
            In the meane time requesting you to thinke that the force of

loue hath constrayned me to yeeld as a slaue, readye at beauties
cōmand to hazard my life for your pleasure: I must needs cōfes
y• the gifts of Nature so abundantly bestowed vpon you, haue so
bewitched my senses, that for my last refuge, I am forced to appeale
vnto your curtesie, as a soueraigne medicine for my incurable
disease: incurable I may tearme it, vnles y• drops of your
fauour quench the flame, or els death with his deadly dart decide
y• cause. But I hope it is vnpossible, y• such a crystal breast should
lodge an hart of Adamāt: y• such a sugred face should haue a bitter
minde: that your diuine beauty should bee ouergrowne with
hellish cruelty, to tormēt thē, who for your loue sustaynes a thousand
miseries. Miserie I may wel cal it: for as there is nothing
more pleasant then beauty: so nothing is more yrksome thā bondage,
&amp; yet my restraunt of liberty is so much the more acceptable,
by how much the more it is desired. For although y• flye willingly
fries in the flame, yet she is blameles: although the Hermine
loues her mortall enemy, yet is she not faultie, sith the one
comes of affection, and the other by course of nature.
            Ah Mamillia, thy beauty hath bought my freedom, &amp; thy heauēly
face hath made me captiue, y• as he which is hurt of y• Scorpiō,
seeketh a salue frō whēce he receiued y• sore: so you only may
minister y• medicine, which procures the disease. The burning feuer
is driuen out with a hot potion, and the shaking palsey with
a colde drinke. Loue onely is remedied by loue, and fancy muste
be cured by mutuall affectiō. Therfore Mamillia, I speake with
teares out wardly, &amp; with drops of blood inwardly, that vnles y•
misling showres of your mercie, mittigate the fire of my fancy, &amp;
giue a soueraigne plaister for my secret sore, I am like to passe
my life in greater miserie, then if I had tasted the infernall torments:
for Sophocles being demanded, what harme hee woulde
wish to his enemy, answered, that he might loue where he was
not liked, &amp; that such misfortune might haue long lasting. But
perhaps you wil say, Mamillia, that the beasts which gase at y•
Panther, are guilty of their own death; that the Mouse taken in
the trap, deserueth her chaunce; that a louer, which hath freewill,
deserueth no pitie, if he make not his choyce right.
            
               
Ah Mamillia, can the strawresist the vertue of the pure Iet? can
flaxe resist the force of the fire? can a Louer withstand the brunt
of bewtie? or freese, if he stand by the flame, or peruert the lawes
of nature? weigh al things in the balance of equitie, and then I
doubt not but to haue a iust iudgement. But this I assure my
selfe, if you knew the strength of my loue, or the force of my loyaltie,
though my person and byrth be farre vnfit for such a mate,
yet you would deeme my loue to deserue no lesse: for Leander
to his Hero, or Piramus to his Thesbe was neuer more fathfull,
then Pharicles will try himself to Mamillia: that although
small acquaintance breedes mistrust, and mistrust hinders loue:
yet tract of time shall inferre such a tryall, as trust shal kindle affection.
            And therefore I hope that your noble heart wil not put a doubt
till occasion be offered, nor cal his credit in question, whom neither
you haue found nor heard to be halting. What though the
Serpentine powder is quickly kindled, and quickly out? yet
the Salamander stone, once set on fire, can neuer be quenched:
As the sappy Myrtle tree wil quickly rotte: so the hard Oake
will neuer be eaten with wormes: Though the free stone is
apt for euery impression: yet the Emerauld will sooner breake,
then receiue any new forme: Though the Polipe chaungeth colour
euery houre: yet the Saphyre will cracke before it consent
to disloyaltie. As all things are not made of one mould:
so all men are not of one minde: for as there hath beene a troathlesse
Iason, so hath there beene a trustie Troylus, and as there
hath beene a dissembling Damocles, so was there a loyall Laelius.
And sure Mamillia, I call the Gods to witnesses, I speake
without fayning, that sith thy bewtie, either by fate or fortune, is
shrined in my heart, my loyaltie shall be such, as the be troathed
fayth of Erasto to his Persida, shal not compare with the loue
of Pharicles to Mamillia. Sith therefore my loue is such,
repaye but halfe so much in parte of recompence, and it will
be suffycient to release my sorrowe. But alas, who can lay
their loue where is no desert, and where want breedes a flat denyall?
            
               
Ah Mamillia, Nature by her secreete iudgement hath endued
all creatures with some perfect qualities, wher want breedes
mislyking. The Moule depriued of sight, hath a woonderfull
hearing: the Hare being very fearefull, is most swift: the fish hauing
no eares, hath most cleere eyes; so I, of meane wealth, and
lesse witte, haue giuen me by nature such a loyal hart, as I hope
the perfection of the one will supply the want of the other, and
if the choyce had beene in my handes, it shoulde haue beene as it
is: therefore sith in you onely consistes my safetie, and that your
bewtie hath gayned the chiefest place in my heart: Whereof I
hope when time shal be fauourable to my desire, to make sufficient
tryal, I humbly beseech you to take pitie vppon him, whose
life &amp; death consistes in your answer: and to let it be such, as you
may haue a faithfull seruant for euer.
            ALthough these wordes of Pharicles, Gentlemen, did not
greatlye displease Mamillia, beecause it is verye harde to
anger a woman with praising her, and especially, if she think asmuch
of her selfe as others speake, yet she would haue hid fire in
the straw, and haue daunced in a net, striuing as much as shee
could, with a discontented countenaunce to couer a contented
mind, and to seeme as cruel as a Tygre, though as meeke as a
Lambe, least either by outward shewe or words hee might coniecture
some hope of good happe, she gaue him this cold confect
for his hotte stomacke.
            SYr, quoth she, although the common prouerb saieth, that the
Citie which comes to parle, and the woman that lendes an
attentiue eare, the one is soone sacked, and the other is easilye
gayned: yet I would wish you not to conceiue any hope, or spend
any trauaell: for your hope shal be voyd, and your labour lost.
            For although I was so foolish to lend you mine eare, I am warie
enough in letting of my heart: for as you found me prodigall
in the one, you shall finde me as niggardly in the other. But
as fables are good enough to passe away the time, so your talke
will seeme to shorten the way, and so I take it. For it is yll halting
before a Cryple, and a burnt childe will feare the fire. And
though I neede not doubt, because I was neuer burnt, yet is it

good to beware by an other mans harme: the Mouse that seeth
her fellow taken in the trappe, and ventureth her self, deserueth
no pittie, if she be caught: the Foxe seeing his marrow almost
kilde with the dogges, is a foole, if he take not squat: it is hard
taking of fowle, when the net is descried: and yll catching of
fish, when the hooke is bare: it is hard, Pharicles, to make her
beleeue, that will giue no credit, &amp; to deceiue her that spyeth the
fetch: when the string is broken, it is hard to hit the white: whē
a mans credit is called in question, it is hard to perswade one.
            Blame me not, Pharicles, if I vrge you so strictly, nor thinke
nothing, if I suspect you narrowly: a woman may knit a knot
with her tongue, she cannot vntie with all her teeth: and when
the signet is set on, it is too late to breake the bargayne: therefore
I had rather mistrust too soone, then mislike too late, I had
rather feare my choyce, then rue my chaunce: I had rather stop
at the brimme, then at the bottome. A womans heart is like the
stone in Aegypt, that will quickly receiue a forme, but neuer
chaunge without 
                  •
               racking: therefore, if I receiue any, it shal be
such a one, as I shall not repent me: I put an if in it, because I
doe not meane to chaunge virginitie with mariage, for it would
be too hard a bargaine: for we see those women, which haue bin
counted most wise, haue beene most chaste, and so fearefull to
match, y• they durst not once cal it in question. Faza, the princesse
of Gaule, when she knew her father had promysed her in mariage,
wept so long, til she became blind. Parthenia after she was
maryed, and had tryed by childebirth the difference betweene
virginitie and mariage, she would neuer after companye with
her husband, saying, that a lasting vertue was to be preferred before
a fading vanitie: sith therfore the most wise haue feared and
eschewed, thinke me not cruell, if I be wise for my self, nor iudg
me not scrupulous, though I put a doubt before I haue cause; or
be in dread to buy repentance at an vnreasonable rate, for if I
were minded to marry, I shoulde hardly find one fish among so
many Scorpions, or one 
                  •
               eral among so many broken glasses.
The woolfe hath as smooth a skin as y• simple sheepe: the sower
Elder hath a fayrer bark thē the sweet gineper: where the water

is calmest, there it is deepest; and where the sea is most quietthere
it is most daungerous; where is the greatest colour of honestie,
there oftentimes is the most want: for an empty vessell
hath a lowder sound then a full barrell, and a dissembling minde
hath more eloquence then a faythfull hart: for trueth is euer naked.
I will not apply the comparison, Pharicles, to any particular,
but in generall: yet if the propositions be vniuersal, they
may inferre in the conclusion a perticular person. The Poets
and paynters representing the loue of menne, bring in Cupid
with a payre of winges; disciphering the loue of women, a Tortuse
vnder the feete of Venus: she wing that as the loue of men
is moueable, and vnconstant as a byrde: so the fancy of women
is as firme &amp; fixed, as a stedfast Tortuse. And with great reason:
for neyther the Romishe recordes, nor Grecian hystories haue
made any, or at the least so oft mention of the disloyaltie of women:
but onely how their simplicitie hath beene beguyled by the
flatterie of faigned louers, of whome the most renomned may
beare sufficient witnes: (as Theseus, Iason, Hercules, Aeneas
and Demophon) that the loue of men hath euer beene inconstant:
yet they so reioysed at their infamous deedes, that the Poets
canonized them, not only for saints, but placed them among
the Gods, so that others of base estate, taking example by
them, doe vaunt of their disloyaltie, as of some glorious conquest,
and as Herostratus fiered the temple of Diana, to be spoken
of, so they falsifie their faith, to be famous. Yet it is a world
to see how the deepest dissembler of them all, can haue teares accommaund
to deceaue a simple mayde? What sighs? what sobs?
what prayers? what protestations? their talke burnes as hotte
as the mount Aetna, when as their affectiō is as cold as a clock:
it is not the loue of y• maid, but y• lust of their mind, not her bountie,
but her bewtle; so that euery face sets them on fire; euery lady,
be she louely, must be their mistres. But no maruel, for if mē
are chollericke, hot in their loue, and dry in their fayth, soone set
on fire, and soone quenched: their loue is euen as lasting as the
flame in the straw: which is as litle permanent, as it is violent, or
like the Apples in Arabia, which begin to rot, ere they be halfe
rype.
            
               
Well Pharicles, although I cast all these doubtes, and others
haue tryed them true, yet I am forced by fancy to take some remorce
of thy tormentes. Medea knew the best, and did followe
the worst in choosing Iason: but I hope not to finde thee so wauering.
            Ah Pharicles, I haue beene brought vp in the court, and although
my bewtie be small and witlesse, yet I haue beene desired
of many, and could neuer fancy any: thou hast wonne the castle
that many haue besieged, and hast obtained that which others
haue sought to gaine: it is not the shape of thy bewtie, but the
hope of thy loyaltie, which enticeth me, not thy fayre face, but thy
faythful heart; not thy comely countenaunce, but thy curteous
manners; not thy wordes, but thy vertues: for she that buyldes
her loue vpon bewty, meanes to fancy but for a while: for where
the subiect is fading, the cause cannot be lasting. Would God,
Pharicles, I might finde thee but such a one, as I will try my
selfe to bee: for whereas thou dost protest such loyaltie; and put
case it be as true as it may be: yet it shall be but counterfeite respecting
mine: be thou but Theagines, and I will try my selfe
to be more constant then Cariclia: no torments, no trauayle, no,
onelye the losse of life shall dimmishe my loue: in liewe thereof
remayne thou but constant, and in pledge of my protested good
wyll, haue heere my hearte and hande to be thine in duste and
ashes.
            
               MAmillia hauing thus ended her talk, I leaue you to iudge,
gentlemen, into what a quandarie Pharicles was brought
                  •
               
seeing the answere of his Mistresse to be so correspondent with
his demaund, &amp; y• fortune was so fauourable to his desire, as she
seemed to will, that he did wish. For if the condemned man reioyseth,
when he heareth his pardon pronounced, or the prisoner
his freedome, no doubt Pharicles ioy could be no lesse, sith denial
was his death, and consent, the conserue to heal his wound:
the greater care, the greater ioy: the more doubt, the more pleasure:
so his vnlookt for hap brought such an inspeakable contentation,
as forced through the extremity of his passions, and incē
               sed
by the constrant of his affection, he burst forth into this talk.
            
               
               MAmillia, if where the water standeth most still, there it is
deepest, and when the winde is lowest, then the greatest tē
               pest
is imminent: so where the minde with ouermuch ioy, or too
much payne is surcharged, there the tongue is both tyed, and the
countenaunce restrayned: so that as the heart is not able to conceiue
it, the tongue is not able to expresse it, as the water potte,
which being full, voydeth no licquour. Publius Metellius hearing
his Sonne had subdued the Equiars, died forioy. Cassinatus
conceaued such a pleasure in seeing his father winne a garland
in Olympus, that he kild himselfe with inward laughter.
If I infer the similitude, perhaps it wil breede doubt: for deedes
in loue are to be required, and not words. Therefore, for feare I
incurre the suspition of flattery, I will leaue you to coniecture
of that, which I thinke.
            But this by the way, assure your selfe, Mistresse Mamillia,
that your bewtie hath so blinded me, as I shall neuer see any,
which so well shal content my minde: and your bountie hath
bounde me neuer to lyke any other. Thus enueigled with the
one, and fettered with the other, I remayne your true seruaunt
for euer.
            WHile they were in these tearmes, Madam Castilla thought
Pharicles had giuen the forte a suffycient battery, for this
tyme: therefore ioyning to them with the rest of the company,
she enterrupted them on this maner.
            MIstresse Mamillia, I beleeue you will go with a cleane
soule to visit the sicke patient: for if you haue beene al this
while at shrift, you might both haue confessed a great many of
faultes, and receiued full absolution. But I pray God your gostly
Father be as holy for the soule, as wholsome for the body: &amp;
if he be, surely you haue heard good counsell: if not: it is Saint
Erauncis fault, he wantes his hoode.
            Madame, quoth Mamillia, if you thinke so well of my goastlye
Father and his shrift, I pray you let him haue you in confession
as long: for you are eldest, and therefore had neede of a
longer examination and larger absolution, if hee be holye for
the soule, he hath enough to take care of his own: as for myne,

I will take charge of my selfe: if wholsome for the body, the
more fitte for your purpose, sith old women are full of diseases,
and had neede haue a Phisition tyed by their girdle: as for saint
Frauncis fault, as you tearme it, if that be a hinderaunce of his
comming, I am sure to pleasure you, he will take the paynes to
fetch it.
            
               Pharicles hearing the tauntes of the Gentlewomen, and seeing
that he was come to the Gentlemans place: because he was
not well acquainted, though against his will, though best for
that time to take his leaue: and therefore offred them the farewell
with this priuy quip.
            Madame, if my keeping the Gentlewoman so long at shrift,
hath beene in any respect offensiue to you, I am very sory: but
if I may stand you as long in steede of a gostly Father, and so
pleasure you, I am at commaund: mary my commission is neither
for worde nor deede, and therefore I doubt your confession
will be too large for mee to deale with all. But sith I haue
brought you thus farre: and am altogether vnaequainted with
the Gentleman, I will take my leaue to depart home, although
against my will.
            Nay surely, quoth Madame Castilla, your hast shall make
waste, and your small acquaintaunce shalbe no hinderance: for
at this time you shall be my guest, and with that they entred into
the place, where after they had saluted the company, and visited
the sicke person, Madam Castilla requested the gentleman
to welcome the stranger for her sake, who both had taken paines
to beare them company, and through his pleasaunt conceites
procured the way to seeme shorter. Signior Gonzaga taking
occasion to shew his good will to Pharicles, aunswered: that
sith the maister of the house was not well, he would say the Gentleman
was welcome in his befalfe: and so taking him by the
hand, welcomed him very friendly. Which curtesie of Gonzaga
was no lesse pleasure vnto Pharicles, then contentation vnto
Mamillia, to see him whom they most doubted, to shew such
a friendly countenaunce, that they both hoped to haue a prosperous
successe in their enterprise.
            
               
Now this sicke Gentleman, called Gostino, had one onely
daughter, named Publia, about the age of sixteen yeeres, whose
bewty and bringing vp, shewed that she was in no respect secōd
vnto Mamillia: but rather more perfect in the giftes of nature.
This young Gentlewoman being by the mothers side cosinue
Germaine to Mamillia, after her duetie done to the company,
requested them to take such a simple dinner, as her father in so
short a time could prouide: giuing them also to vnderstand by her
behauiour, that the influence of the heauens had denyed her nothing:
but that nurture had forced her self to augment the grace
of nature, and that comlines of body, and curtesie of the minde
hadde a continuall warre, which shoulde haue the superyoritie.
            This gorgeous Goddesse furnished with these singular qualities
in euery respect, so set on fire Pharicles fancy, that as if he
had drunke of the fountaines in Ardenia, his hot loue was turned
to as cold a lyking.
            Now his heart was set vpon Publia, which of late was vowed
to Mamillia, in such a sorte, that his stomacke lost the woonted
appetite to feede the eyes with the bewtie of his new Goddesse,
as that he seemed to haue eaten of the hearbe Spattania,
which shutteth vp the stomacke for a long season. And Publia
on the contrary side, noting the feature of Pharicles, the comlynesse
of his person, and the rarenes of his qualities, was so scortched
with the bewtie of this new guest, as finding occasion to
conuey her selfe into her closet, vnder the colour of some serious
businesse, she powred forth her plaintes in this order.
            O vnhappy fortune, O lucklesse destinie, hath Publia prepared
a banquet to entrappe her selfe with a more daincy delicat?
hath she layde the net, and is taken in the snare? hath shee welcommed
him that hath caught her captiue: well, now I see, that
as the Bee that flyeth from flower to flower, hauing free choyce
to chuse at libertie, is at last taken by the winges, and so fettered:
in like manner my fancy taking the viewe of euery face,
hath a restraint of her freedome, and is brought in bondage with
the bewty of this straunger.
            
               
Alas, what shall I doe? Shal I loue so lightly? shal Fancie
giue me the foyle at the first dash? shal myne eyes be the cause of
my miserie? would God they had lost their sight in the cradle,
shal my heart be so tender, to yeelde at the first call? would God
nature had framed it of Adamant, to resist the force of such foolish
cogitations.
            Ah Publia, consider thy state: what hath he more to be beeloued
then other? thy suters haue had to beliked. What, foole? dost
thou aske a question of Loue, or a reason of Fancy? striue not against
the streame: if thou resist Loue, thou art ouermatched.
            For euen the Gods are tributaries vnto Venus, as confessinge
the superiorities of beauties kingdomes, then be not thou ashamed,
being but a simple maide. Venus loued a black smith with
a poult foote: and thou a Gentleman of singular perfection: yet
as there is a difference betweene thee and Venus in bewtie: so
is there a greater distaunce betweene Vulcan and him in deformitie.
Then Publia, yeelde when thou must needes consente:
run when thou art called by command: for sure, if euer thou wile
bestowe thy freedome, he is worthy to haue thee captiue: if thou
meanest to marrie, thou canst not haue a meeter match: yea but
how if his heart be placed, and his minde settled? then were I a
great deale better to wayle at the first, then weepe at the last; to
be content with a litle pricke, then with a deepe wound. The
Scorpion, if he touch neuer so lightly, enuenometh the whole
body: the least sparke of wilde fier sets on fire a whole house:
the Coeatrice killeth euen with her sight: ye sting of loue woundeth
deadly: the flame of Fancy fireth the whole bodye: and the
eyes of a Louer are counted incurable: yet the Elephant being
euuenomed with the Uiper, eateth him vp, and is healed, there is
nothing better for burning, then heat of fire, &amp; nothing so soone
killeth a Basilisk, as the sight of a man. Then Publia, sith Pharicles
hath giuē the wound, let him salue the sore: let the fire of
affection driue out the flame of Fancy; and sith thou art hurte
by the eie, be healed by the sight: hope for the best: for thou hast as
much to be loued, as he to be liked: &amp; therfore remain patient, til
thou knowest more. With yt she went out of her closet: but before

her returne the strangers had dined, and were al descanting of
the Gentlemans disease.
            So many heads, so many wits: for some saide it was a feuer,
and proceeded of cold: some, the consumption of the milte, whose
originall was thought some burstines, and ensued of flegme:
some one thing, and some an other: but all I thinke mist the
marke. Gonzaga, who heard all their opinions, sayd, that if the
Gentleman were not wel stricken in age, whatsoeuer the disease
was, he would say the first cause was loue: and my reason is this,
quoth he: the oft chaunge of colours, his sodaine traunces, his
sighes in his dreame, the dead stopping of his pulses, and then
their beating a fresh, al these are signes of an vnquiet minde, of
an impatient affection, and to be flat, of loue it selfe.
            
               Signior Gonzaga, quoth the sicke Gentleman, eyther you
are expert in phisick, or els you speake by experiēce: but whether
you doe, you misse the cushion: for my disease doth not proceede
of loue: nor if I were wel, should it: for I haue felt the first dishe
of so variable a tast, that I wil neuer eate of the secōd: I meane,
I felt the presence of my wife so sweet, and her absence by death
so sowre, as I meane, neuer to try the like hap. But nowe, sith
you are all at leysure, and I very gladde to heare any thing that
might mittigate the paine, or shorten the time, I woulde craue
this boone of you all in general, that one of you woulde satisfie
my minde in this, to tel me what thing it is the common people
call loue.
            The Gentlemen of their curtesie could doe no lesse but condiscend
to their hostes request: yet euery one alleadging of disability,
so that they were forced to cast lots, who shoulde discusse
this hard question: &amp; amongst al, the chance fel vpon Pharicles,
which although it was some small griefe vnto him, because hee
doubted of his habilitye: yet hee thought Fortune fauoured
him in this poynt, that he might shew his cunning before Publia.
            
            Where I cannot but muse, Gentlemen, to see that such moyst
licour shold turne to hard flint: that the most wholsome Mithridate
in twise shifting, should be deadly poyson: that the Reedes

in Candie, will of their owne nature beecome bitter gall: that
the loue of men should turne to hard harted: that fancy should be
quenched at the second sight: that the affection of Pharicles,
should turne to frantik folly, in mislyking without cause, and
choosing without tryall: but it is not so common, as true, that
men be fickle in their fayth, brittle in their braine, and lukewarme
in their loue: neither hot nor cold, euen like the Pickerell,
that keepeth the baight in his mouth, to cast out at his pleasure:
yet where doe we see any writing of loue, or of any such
matter: but they must haue one fling at women? dispraysing
their nature, disciphering their nurture, painting out their polliticke
practises and subtil shiftes, declaring their mutabilitie,
comparing them to the Polipe stone, that chaungeth colours euery
houre; to the Weathercock, that wauereth with the wind;
to the Marigolde, whose forme is neuer permanent, but chaungeth
with the Sunne: and yet they themselues a great deale
worse: as Pharicles, one of the same sect presently shal proue:
who fryed at euery fire, and chaunged his looke at euery leeke,
as one that builded vppon bewtie, and not bountie; that did lust,
but not loue; with which fickle feuer ye Gentlemen of our time
are greatly troubled: for he that cannot looke &amp; laugh, and tel a
tale with nulla fide, they wil straight note him in ther tables for
a dunce, or put him in their bookes for a foole: and yet they wil
needes fry in frost, &amp; freese in fire: they see, &amp; yet are blind: they
heare without eares, they spend the day in sighing, and the night
in sobbes; they haue heapes of care, streames of teares, waues
of woe: yea, to be short, they like without loue, and fancy, without
affection, that their choyce must needes chaunge, because it
is without reason.
            But againe to Pharicles, who seeing necessitie on the one
side, and his credit on the other, to be two spurres in his side, and
that the Gentlemen were attentiue, began on this manner.
            THe Poets and Paynters fayned not fortune blinde, without
good cause, and great reason: for as her gifts are vncertaine:
so the lotte is doubtfull, and the chaunce vnlooke for, most often
happeneth: she imparteth wealth to the foole, and pouertie to

the wise: she powreth water into the Sea, when it ouerfloweth,
and giueth riches to him that is cloyed with aboundance: doe
we not see, that were is most neede, there she giueth least? and
the most noble men haue the woorst lucke? Policrate is a mirrour
of her mutabilitie, by his miserable end: and Abdolominus,
a patterne of her frailtie, by his good happe: and I heere
may serue for a proofe of her small skill, that hath layed a great
burden on me, which am leest able to beare it. But on the small
braunch hangeth oft the most fruit; and on the woorst wit somtimes
chaunceth the greatest charge: for neither my experience
by nurture, nor my wit by nature, hath wherof to compare with
the worst of the company, and yet fortune by lot hath layde the
most on me, so that he that woorst may, must hold the candle.
            But sith a man must needes go when the diuel driues, although
I know my faulte, and you shall finde it, yet the hope of your
curtesie, voyde of curiositie, somewhat encourageth my slender
skill to presume the farther, although beetweene your learned
eares and my rude tongue there will be great discord. I will
not doe as Hiarbitas and Hermonides, who striuing to excell
in musicke, for euer lost their voyces, least if I force my selfe in
eloquence to seeme a courtier, I proue at length a flat carter.
Astorides seeing Roscius gestures, durst neuer after come on
the stage: Hiparchion hearing Rufinus blowe vpon his pipe,
would neuer after play on his flute. Two thinges daunte the
minde of a young man; eyther the skill or person of the hearer.
Demosthenes the famous Orator of Athens was so astonished
at the maiestie of king Philyp, that he lost his speech: Carnitus
seing Anniball comming into the schooles, became dumb: then
it is no meruaile, gentlemen, if I be afrayed to incur the cōmon
proueth. A fooles bolt is soone shot; or to doubt yt my green wit
should giue a rash reason, or enter too far in mine own conceite,
which was so hurtful to Marsias, yt with his pipe would imitate
Apollos harp. Notwithstanding as the prick of the spurre forceth
the horse that feareth the euill way, so in this my doubt the
reuerence I beare to Gostino and the rest of the company banisheth
al feare, assuring my selfe you will lay the fault vpon fortune,

who made the lotte so vnequall, and let my vniust chaunce
serue for a sufficient excuse: and if I happe to stretch too farre,
I wil blowe the retrayte with repentance which neuer commeth
without pardon.
            When I coniecture with my selfe, Gentlemen, the great trauel
and industry that the auncient Philosophers, and learned
men haue taken in searching out the secrets of nature, insomuch
that some of them haue put out their owne eyes, to attayne to
the greater perfection, thinking that they were obstacles &amp; hinderances
of their profound contemplations, as did Democles.
Others being extreemely delighted with supernaturall cogitations,
aud enamoured of the Mathematical artes, with gazing
vp into the skie, haue fallen backward, and broken their neckes,
as did Gallus: some searching out the essence of the first matter,
waded so farre in the depth of Astronomy, seeking out the
causes of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, that they drowned
themselues, as Aristotle. Others coueting to know the sense of
secret maters scanning the quidities of Logike, haue lost their
wittes, as Crinitus, and many other moe. I cannot but maruel
that among al these secretaries of nature, there haue neuer
byn found any which haue enterprised to search out the essence
and perfect nature of loue. Sure I thinke they might answeare
with Hermes, who being demāded what God was, said he could
neuer giue answeare, because the farther he went, the more was
behinde, yet in my iudgement the true loue is no other thing,
but a desire of that which is good; and this good is the influence
of the celestiall bountie: so that by the definition it is to be placed
in the intellectuall part of the mynd, and not in the sensuall:
but your question Signior Gostino is of that which the commō
people cal loue.
            
               Ouid, who thought himselfe a maister of that art, and writ
precepts of the same, thought it more obscure then the Letters
of Ephesus, or the riddles of Sphinx, to tel the perfect definition
of loue: so that being demanded what it was, answered, that hee
knew not what it should be, from whence it sprong, whether it
went, nor to what end it tended: but sure, quoth he, it is the losse

of a mans selfe: Anacreon said it was

                mischiefe 
                  〈◊〉
                or
a pince of pleasure we receiue a gallon of sorow: for what weapinges,
what watchinges, what cursinges, what sighes, what
trauel doth the louer endure? so that in an other place he calleth
it a warfarre, for the drumme of fancy, strikes vp the Alarum in
the Louers heartes, as he goeth to fight, knowing to be vanquished:
and that euery frowning looke of his Lady, is worse then
the shot of a cruell Cannon. And yet the Passionate Louer is
thought to abyde no payne, nor suffer no trouble.
            
               Calimachus calleth it a Court without Sergeantes, for because
they that loue, obey without consistant, and are captiue
without conquest. Therefore in

               Signior Gostino, whether it were through the weakenes of
his stomacke, or the extremetie of his paine, was forced to interrupt
Pharicles in the middes of his talke, requesting the Gentleman
not to think that it was wearines of his discourse: but yt
straungenesse of the disease, that procured this restraint, and to
entreate the rest of the companye not to take it in euill parte,
that hee was the cause of such a sodaine intermission, hoping the
Gentleman at their next meeting woulde satisfie their mindes
fully, wishing Pharicles not to bee a straunger at his house,
but to vse him as a friend, and the oftner he should come, the better
he should be welcome.
            
               Pharicles, with the rest of the Gentlemen, perceiuing Gostino
to craue rest, and that his drowsie eyes chymed for sleepe,
thanking him for their good cheere, and wishing his welfare,
tooke their leaue, and departed.
            But Pharicles, whose heart was on his halfpenny, found fish
on his fingers, that he might be the last should take his leaue of
Publia, to see if he could strike fire out of the flint: and therefore
strayning her by the hand, gaue her his A dio.
            
            Gentlewoman, if I take my leaue more boldly then any of
ther rest, impute the fault to your bewtie, and not to my impudencie,
which so hath fixed my fancy with the flame of affection,
as

               n halfe in doubt it is vnquenchable: yet though the patient
knowes his disease vncurable, he couetes a plaister to mitigate
the paine. But I hope well, and if I may haue wel, I
shall thinke my selfe to get as much as I would wish.
            The traueller talking of hunger, hath euer a more sharp stomacke,
and I so long discoursed of loue, that where before I
shotte as a blinde man: nowe were I able to speake by experience.
For Ouid, nor all the maisters of loue coulde neuer
finde out a more perfect definition, then my fancie, fettered in
the beames of your bewtie, hath imprinted into my mind: so that
by the charge of Venus, will you, nill you, I remaine your seruaunt.

is fumed with some vapours, proceeding from a hotte stomacke,
procuring a rash iudgement: so that when it shalbe alayed
with some cold confection, you wil not be of the same opinion.
But sure I am content at your next commiyng, to take
a recantation for a recompence of your errour, which the

stayed minde of Publia, to swarue from the vowed virginitie:
so that thinking my selfe as chaste, as any in Padua, I proue the
lightest in Italy: for I yeelde before I be ouercome: I consent
without compulsiō: the first assault, the first shot, the first Alarm,
yea the first worde hath scaled the walles, wonne the Fort, and
caught me captiue. Alas, what will they say, that praysed me for
my vertue? will they not as fast disprayse me for my vice? will
not my father fret, my kinsfolke cry out, my friendes be sory, my
enemies laugh me to scorne? yea, will not al the world wonder,
to see me of late giuen to chastitie, and now shake handes with
virginitie? to yeeld my deerest Iewel and chiefest treasure vnto
the straunger? The choyce of a friend requireth the eating of
a bushell of salt; then the choosing of a husband, tenne; for by
how much the bande is straighter, by so much the choice should
be longer.
            But I almost lyke beefore I looke, and loue beefore I
knowe, and cast my corne, I wotte not where; and am lyke to
reape, I knowe not what. Ah foole, is not the Iacinth, if it be
rubbed with lyme, soone set a fire, and hardly quenched? is not
the Adamant and the yron soone ioyned, and hardly disseuered?
the coyne hath his stampe in a moment, and cannot be taken
out without melting. Loue entreth easily, and is as hard to thrust
out as nature: fancye soone fireth: but long ere it quencheth:
yea but Publia, flatter not thy selfe: for soone rype, soone rot

               eth without compulsion, will weare awaye
without constraint: marryage, if it be soone begun, yet it is not
so soone ended. Take time and choyce, and choose warily, not
his face: for nothing so soone gluttes the stomacke, as sweete
meate; and nothing sooner filles the eye, then bewtie: for oftentymes
where is the best proportion, there are the woorst properties;
the wine is not knowne by the caske, but by the taste. The
Gods intending to: shew the perfection of nature in one creature,
framed a man so exquisit in forme and feature, as neither
for the lmiamentes of his face, nor the proportion of his bodye
was possible to be sayde, this was wanting. This demy God being
sent vpon the earth, when as noone could condemne nature

of want, Momus onely found this fault, that the Gods framed
not a window in his brest, through which to perceiue his inward
thoughtes: meaning, as I coniecture, that there is none so comly
in his body, but may bee corrupte in his minde, nor so fine in
his feature, but he may be faultie in his fayth: to cōclud, as euery
saint hath his feast, so euery man hath his fault; that a man 
                  •
               ad
neede groope well, that should finde one fish amonge so manye
Scorpions, and what a one Pharicles is, I may easily gesse, but
I know not.
            Ah Publia, if any one heard thy talke, they might condemne
thee of villany. Wilt thou speak euil of him which wisheth well
to thee? shal y• reward of loue be loathing? doth good wil deserue
hatred? or fancy defiance? What hath he, ye thou maist not like? or
what wouldest thou like, that is wanting in him, neither bewty,
birth, wisdome, wealth, &amp; what more is to be required in a man?
Ah, nothing, Publia: his store procureth thy want, his perfection
hath made thee vnperfect, as now thy welfare hanges in the wil
of an other man, and doost both liue and loue, so that conclude
with thy self, Pharicles must be he, whose shape thou wilt shrine
in thy heart for euer, hap good or happe euill, against all the assaultes
of fortune.
            
               Publia was not thus vexed on the one side, but Pharicles suffred
a farre greater torment: that after hee came to his lodging
casting himselfe on his bedde, hee exclaymed on his happe in
such sorte, that the aboundance of teares were sufficient signe 
                  •
               
of his woe.
            O Pharicles, Pharicles, what a doubtefull combate dost
thou feele in thy minde betweene fancy and fayth, loue and loyaltie,
beautie and bountie? shal the flickering assault of fancy ouerthrow
the castle of constancy, shall the lightnesse of loue violate
the league of loyaltie? shal the shadow of bewtie wipe out
the substance of bounty? shall hope bee of more force then assurance?
wilt thou vow thee constant to one, and prooue thy selfe
not stedfast to any? the Turtle chuseth, but neuer changeth; the
Swan lyketh, but neuer loatheth; the Lyon after he hath entred
league with his make, doth neuer couer a new choyce: these haue

but only sense; and I am sure thou hast reason and sense, and art
more vnruly: they haue but nature for their guide, and yet are
constant: thou haste both nature and nurture, and yet thy
minde is mouable: these brute beastes keepe their consent inuiolable,
and thou a reasonable creature dost falsifie thy faith with
out constraint, yea euen breake thine oath without compulsion,
whereas nothing is so to be hated, as periury, and a man hauing
cracked his credit, is halfe hanged.
            
               Marcus Regulus rather then hee shoulde falsifie his fayth,
euen to his enemies suffered a most horrible death. Horatius
Secundus being betroathed to Ciuilia, was rackt to death for
his constancy. Lamia a Concubine, by no torments coulde be
haled from the loue of Aristogicon. What perilles suffered
Theagines to keepe his credit with Caricha? Pharicles, let
these examples mooue thee to be loyall to Mamillia: be thou
stedfast, and no doubt thou shalt not finde her staggering: but if
thou wauer, ware thou dost not as the dogge, loose both bones:
for deceit deserues deceite, and the ende of tretcherie, is to haue
small trust.
            
               Sudasus a Parian borne, when he came into the courte, to
sweare, that he neuer loued Castana, became dumbe, and so was
condemned. Iouinianus Otto nephewe to Alexādrus Farnesius,
after that he had renounced his vow made to his louer, ran
madde: beware, Pharicles, of the like rewarde, if thou commit
the lyke offence. Tush hee that would refraine from drinke, because
hee hath heard that Anacreon died with the potte at his
head, or that hateth an egge, because Appeius Sauleius dyed in
eating of one, would be noted for an Asse: so if I should stand to
my pennyworth, hauing made my market like a foole, and may
chaunge for the better, because other in the like case haue had euill
happe, I may eyther be counted for a Cowarde, or a Calfe.
            Dooe not the Gods, saye the Poets, laugh at the periurie
of Louers? and that Iupiter smyles at the crafte of Cupyd?
Paris, when he stole away Helena, and forsooke his Oenone:
did not both Sea and winde fauour his enterprises with a
speedy gale? Theseus had neuer better lucke, then after hee

had forsaken Ariadne: and I perchaunce may haue as good hap
in leauing Mamillia. He that hauing tasted of water, &amp; after wil
not drink of wine, is of a grose nature. The dog that winding ye
Hedgehogge, will not forsake the sent, to hunt at the Hare, is
but a Curre, and he that wil not change in loue, if bewtie make
the choyce, shal not come in my Creede. Mamillia is faire, but
not second to Publia: she is wittie, but ye other more wise, where
the sauce sharpened with prunes, casteth of sugar, it is follye to
infer comparison. Yea, but what complaintes will Mamillia
make, when she perceiueth thy dissembling? her hotte loue will
cu

               ne to deadly hate, shee will procure thy discredit euen with
Publia: she will blase thy forged flattery, not onely here in Padua,
but throughout all Italy. I shall haue Gonzagā

enemy, yea, and mine owne friendes to be my foes, yea and perhappes
by that meanes, both loose her friendship, and the others
fauour.
            Tush, Pharicles, he that is afrayed to venture on the Buck,
because he is wrapped in the bryers,
                  •
                shall neuer haue Hunters
happe, and he that puts a doubt in loue at euery chau
                  •
               e, shall neuer
haue Louers luck. Cannot the Ca
                  •
                catch mise, without she
haue a bel hanged at her eare? cānot ye Hobby sease on his pray,
but he must checke? cannot the Spanyel returne the Partridge
but he must quest? and cannot I deale so warily, 
                  •
               ut al the world
must ring of it? yes, it is a subtill birde, that breedes among the
aery of hawkes, and a 
                  〈◊〉
                sheepe that lambes in the Foxes
denne, and he shalbe crafty shal spy mee halting. I can like Mamillia
for a neede, and loue Publia of necessitie: it is good to
keepe a stale, for feare I catch no foule, and needefull to holde
Mamillia on the 
                  •
               ist, least Publia proue so haggard, she will not
come to the lure. He that hath two fishes at the baight, it is hard
if he misse both. Therefore I will be of the surer side alwayes
prouided, Publia shall haue my heart, and I hers, or els I wyll
sitte beside the saddle. And with that he fell in a study with himselfe,
of sundry matters pertayning to his amorous deuises, and
at last determined with himselfe, if he could find a trusty messenger
to send her a letter, fearing if he should make his repayre 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
sodainely, it would breede some suspition in Gostinos heade,
for hee that loues, castes beyonde the Moone, and especially he
that dissembles: and craft had neede of cloking, where trueth is
euer naked.
            Where, by the way, Gentlemen, we see Pharicles a perfect
patterne of Louers in these our dayes, that beare two faces vnder
one hoode; and haue as many Ladyes as they haue wittes,
and that is not a fewe: for euery newe face must haue a newe
fancye; and if hee see a thousand, they must all be viewed with
a figh, as though hee were enamoured; if she be younger, her
tender age pleaseth him; if she be of middle age, the rypenesse
of her yeeres, contenteth him: another enchaunteth him with
her voyce, and one with her gestures: so that his couetous defire
woulde haue all, and yet amidst this store he is pyned, and
dissembling doubt maketh a restraint of his choyce, yet he must
needes be a Carpet Knight: for they thinke it as harde to lyue
without loue, as without meat. But when they beginne to like,
it is a worlde to see howe they learne to lye: fancy they cannot,
without flattery; nor talk without tales, they be dead at the first
dash, &amp; plunged in Plutos pitte, when they haue a merier heart
thē the poore maide. They say, a womā is the weaker vessel, but
sure in my iudgement, it is in the strength of her body, and not
in the force of her minde: For the rypest witte, the readyest heat;
the moste subtill skonce is fayne to sette his braynes on the last,
and his witte on the tenters to deceiue a simple mayde: first he
assayes with flattery, then with sophistry, inferryng his comparisons,
he is caught in the beames of her bewtie, as the Bee
in the cobwebbe; hee is parched with the hue of her face, as the
Flye in the candle; hee is drawne by the qualities of her mind,
and the sweetenesse of her voyce, as with a Syrens songue,
and when perhappes she hath nothing to be praysed nor to bee
lyked in her, yet the comlynesse of her bodye, and the rarenesse
of her condicions, hath so enchaunted, as if shee heale not his
wound, he shal as it were with Circes cup be turned to a hog or
a horse.
            And this they vse not to one, but to many, counting him a

foole that cannot flatter; and a dol
                  •
               e, that dare not disemble, as
Pharicles an Archeaptaine of their crue presently wil prooue,
who knewe the best, and followed the woorst; and could speake
hotlye, but follow it as coldly.
            For after that hee had giuen the raynes of libertie to his
frantike affections, and hadde fostered the sparke to growe to
a great flame, the medicine then came too late, when the disease
was incurable: the more he did striue, the woorse he was:
euen as the Harte, which feeling the arrowe in his side, the
more he forceth him selfe, the farther it entreth; or the byrde
being taken in the nette, by struggling becomes faster: so hee
seeking to eschewe his first maladie, fell into a deeper sicknesse,
perceiuing as the wounde by time is more grieuous then when
the blowe was freshe, so loue encreaseth by delay, and delayes
breede daungers: fearing agayne his hastie venturing might
procure a slacke speedinge, determyned to take counsell at
his pyllowe, and as his minde shoulde giue him, to prosecute
his purpose: and in this doubte hee remayned the space of a
weeke.
            In which tyme Publia seeing Pharicles made no great haste
in his returne, thought her newe Louer would proue an olde
scoffer, condemning her selfe of follye, that shee should bee so
soone enticed by flatterie, seeking to roote out that by reason,
which was inserted by sensualitie, knowing, no fitter remedie
for loue, then to resist betimes, in which determination,
as she should haue proceeded, she had the retrait blown by a letter,
which Pharicles had sent her by his page. Likwise offering
in his maysters behalfe, a present vnto Gostino, in recompence
of his good cheere, which he receiuing gracefullye, wished the
Page to giue it to his daughter, who taking the present, and receiuing
the Letter, could scarcely stay to vnrip the seale, while
she came in her closet, where betweene hope and dread she read
these lines following:
            
               
                  
                  Pharicles to Publia.
                  
                     IF the Gods, Publia, hauing made man, had
likewise giuen him free will to bee mayster
of himselfe, in subduing his rebellious affections,
or hadde appoynted medicine for the
minde, as Phisick for the soule, I needed not
at this time haue sought for helpe to resist the
assaultes of contrary passions, as he that after long combat for
the defence of his libertie, is forced to yeelde by the strength of
the Uictor, hoping by submission to obtaine the more fauour.
                  But nature and fortune hath in no creature framed such a perfect
vnformitie, but there is as great a contrarietie: and as many
salues as arte hath taught, so many sores nature hath giuen, neuer
suffering blisse to come without bale, nor good lucke without
ill happe, finding alwayes a cooling carde of misfortune to
pluck down ye puffing peate of prosperitie. The Bee, as she hath
the fragrant flower, wheron to take delight, so she hath the Spiders
webbe wherein to be tangled. The flye, as she is reuiued
by the heate of the Sunne, so is she consumed by the flame of
the fire: as the Lyon cooleth his stomacke with eating the Seamouse,
so is it inflamed with eating the litle Ermelyne. But
although in this respect I cannot greatly eyther accuse nature
or fortune, yet the destinies I thinke haue framed your bewtie
such a furious enemy to my carefull minde, as it hath made such
a breach in my heart, that the strongest rampyre and surest defence
I could make is not possible to resist the cōtinual Alarms,
wherewith the remembraunce of your rare vertues night and
day doe assayle me in such wise, that since my departure I haue
felt in my heart, as in a little world, al the passions and contrarieties
of the Elementes. For my eyes, Publia, I call the gods
to witnesses, I speake without fayning, almost turne into water
through the continuall streams of teares, and my sighes flye as
winde in the ayre, proceeding from ye flaming fire which is kindled
in my hart, as that without the droppes of your pittie, it wil
turne my body into dry earth and cinders.
                  
                     
Then, Publia, sith your beautie is my bale, let it be my blyssecouet
not to vanquish him which is already captiue, striue not
for my lyfe, sith you haue my libertie, but let the waues of mercie
quench the fire of fancy, and doe but render loue for loue: yea,
Publia, such loue as eternitie shall neuer blot out with obliuion,
neyther any sinister fortune in any wise do diminishe: so that if
the world wondred at the loyaltie of Petrarch to his Laura, or
Amadis to Oriane: they shall haue more cause to meruell at
the loue of Pharicles to Publia, whose lyfe and death standeth
in your answere, which I hope shal be such as belongeth to the
desert of my loue, and the shew of your bewtie.
                  
                     Yours, if he be Pharicles.
                  
               
            
            
               
                  PVblia hauing read ouer this Letter, viewing
and reuiewing euery lyne in particular,
chaunged colours at euery sillable, fearing
to be foyled by flatterye, or to be brought into
a fooles paradise by promises, knowing
that the Nyghtingale hath a sweete voyce,
and yet but a rankefleshe: that the Storkes
in India haue a pleasaunt cry, but a bloody byl: that the fayrest
Nutte without, may haue the fowlest Worme within: that the
most daynty delicates may be sauced with deadly poyson: that
smooth talke and fayre promises maye haue but small performance:
that wordes were but winde: that inke and paper were
not sufficient pledges for such an inseperable knot: yet hope
haled her on to thinke well of his offer: and that shee whiche
would not trust ere she tryed, should not proue without peryll:
saying that experience is the Mistresse of fooles, and that they
which were incredulous, incurred the greatest suspition of flatterie:
so amidst these sundry dumpes, shee tooke her penne, and
sent Pharicles this dumpe.
            
               
                  
                  Publia to Pharicles.
                  
                     MAister Pharicles, your Letters being more
hastily receiued then hartily read, I stoode
in a doubt, whether I should answere with
silence, or Sophistrie: for because where the
question is extream, there the answere must
needes want a meane: and where the demand
is but a iest, it is best to make replye with a
scoffe. But at length I was resolued to write more largly then
I would, hoping both to profit and perswade you. Profit, I
meane, in that I spying so soone your faining, I may dehorte
you from flatterie, and 
                        •
                     e the meanes that you leaue this folly,
to be passionate onely in your pentie, a louer but in your lippes:
for although you thinke my simple witte hath no such caparitie
to conceiue your vaine iesting, yet all women are not of one
mettall, but as I knowe it, and beare with it: so they wil spy it,
and both blabbe it, and blame it: yea perhappes crosse you out
of their creede: for he that hath beene scratched with the briers,
will take heede of a thorne, and he that sees his felow hurt, will
beware of the like harme; hee that hath beene deceiued with a
lye, will scarsely credit a true tale. Women are wily, and will
take example one by an other: so that it shall bee heard for one
to halt before a cryple: they thinke euery one that writes an amorous
style, doth not loue faithfully: but most of them lye falsly.
A pricke with a penne proued not Clanuel a true Louer,
but a troathlesse Lechour: yea many write before they knowe
the partie, and get by it they know not what: so that, Pharicles,
if women would credit euery line, they would buy repentaunce
too deare. But if Phillis were aliue in these our dayes, shee
would neuer hange her selfe: and if Dido had beene incredulou
                        •
                     ,
she had not dyed so desperately. Therefore Pharicles, if I
doubt without cause, or feare before I haue occasion, blame me
not, sith others haue suffered such euill hap by venturing too far
in an vnknowne vessell.
                  
                  Well, put case your flattery be fayth, and that all that you haue written is Golden: yet you clayme kindnesse where none was offered: or else you thinke because I sayd farewel friendly, I did fancy firmly: surelye eyther you are deceiued, or else I was in a dreame at the departure: for I doe not know in what respect eyther my words or deedes should be a spurre to pricke you forward in this rash entirprise: but assure your selfe, if there were any, I repent me of them, not that I am so foolish to repay hatred for loue: but that I haue vowed perpetuall virginitie, and meane to remaine chaste for euer. Therefore Pharicles, sease to craue that cannot be gotten: seeke not for impossibilities: quench the fire your selfe, when an other cannot put out the flame: abate the force of loue, where you cannot haue your longing.
                  I giue you perhappes a sower sauce to your sweete meate: because I will not feede you with delayes, nor fobbe you with fayre wordes, and foule deedes: but I speak as I thinke, &amp; so you shall finde it. Yet in fine, least you should iudge me altogether vngratefull, I thank you for your good will, and I thinke well of it: and if euer I chaunce to loue, you haue as much to like as any: therefore if your fancy be so fixed, as you make faire on, pray that both my heart my turne, and my vow may be broken, and then hope well. But in the meane time, if you come, you shall be welcome, as a friend: but no farther.
                  
                     Yours, if she could, Publia.
                  
               
            
            
               After that Pharicles, gentlemen, had receiued and read this Letter, seeing the beginning was hard, thought the ending as ill, so that beeing somewhat chollericke, hee threw it awaye in a rage, not half read, rebuking his folly in so soon yeelding vnto fancy, turning his great loue to a greeuous hate, as one somwhat tickled with self loue, thinking yt Hawk too haggard, that should not come at the first cal: now againe praysing his Mamillia, vowing wholye his heart vnto her, and promising in recompence of his disloialtie, neuer to lend Publia a good looke, and in this determination flang out of

study, and went to the house of Gonzaga.
            
            HEre gentlemen, we may see the flitring of mens fancy, and
the ficklenes of their fayth, that they may well be compared
to a blacke wal, that receiueth euery impression, which not withstanding
with the wipe of ones hand is easily defaced: so men
loue all, and now none, verifying the saying of Calimachis,
that as flowers fade and florish euery yeare so their loue is hotte
and cold euery houre, hauing nothing certaine but onely this,
that the last driueth out the first, as one nayle forceth cut an other;
the nature of men is so destrous of noueltie. But because it
is an euill dogge, barks at his fellow, againe to Pharicles, who
being come into the house of Gonzaga, found not all things according
to his desire for Mamillia was halfe sick in 
                  〈◊〉
                bed, yet
she her self knew scarsly the disease: but Pharicles missing her,
went farder, and sound Madam Castilla sitting solytary in her
Muses, whom after he had saluted and demaunded how mistres
Mamillia did: Mary quoth Madam Castilla, your often repair
vnto her, as farre as we can coniecture, hath driuen her into a
plurisie, or vs into som ielousie: but whether it did she is sicke.
            
               Pharicles, feeling his gald conscience prick
                  •
                sayd, that although
it pleased her to iest by cōtraries, yet his return was as
speedy, as might be: for his busines was so necessary, that the
losse of his landes hanged, thereon: but if he had knowne Mamillia
would haue conceiued any displeasure at his absence, he
would not onely haue hasarded his landes, but haue ventured his
life to haue made his repaire more speedy: if then her sicknesse
proceedes of my negligence, I hope my sufficient excuse will
be a remedy to cure the disease.
            You speak wel, quoth Madam Castilla: therefore follow me,
that you may plead your owne cause for I will be no Aduocat:
and with that she caried him into Mamillias chamber, where
she lay, half sleeping, half waking, whom Madam Castilla called
out of her traunce with this parle.
            MIstres Mamillia, quoth she, you know whē time was, we
tearmed this Gentleman a gostly father: therfore I thoght
good in this your sickenes, that he should receiue your cōfession,

as one most meete for the purpose I thank you for your paines,
quoth Mamillia: for indeede I haue a great block in my conscience,
which I meane to reueale vnto him, &amp; that is of my folly,
in louing so lightly, and fixing my fancy, where I doubt is no
fayth whereof, if he can giue me absolution, I shall surely bee
bound vnto him.
            
               
                  〈1 paragraph〉
               
            
            
               
                  〈1 paragraph〉
               
            
            Ah Mamillia, quoth Pharicles, doe you thinke, that I haue
such a trayterous heart, or such an impudent face to imagine
such trechery against your diuine bewtie? No, no, Mamillia, I
call the Gods to witnesses, and the heauens to heare my protestations,
and if my words be not conformable to my thoughts:
the internal furies conspire my vtter destructiō; and if my mind
remaine not constant, and my fancy firme, the Gods themselues
be reuengers of such disloyaltie.
            Well, said Mamillia, Iason promysed as much to Medea,
and yet shee founde him a lyer: but I feare no such matter.
            No, me thinke, quoth Madame Castilla, I dare promise for

the Gentleman. But now let vs see how we can find our teeth occupyed,
as we haue doone our tongues, and then I will say none
of vs are fallen into a consumption, through weakenesse of stomacke:
so they all went to dinner.
            Where I leaue you to consider, Gentlemen, how far vnmeete
women are to haue such reproches layd vppon them, as sundrye
large lipt felowes haue done: who whē they take a peece of work
in hand, and either for want of matter, or lack of wit are half grauelled,
then they must fill vp the page with slaundering of womē,
who scarsly know what a woman is: but if I were able either by
wit or arte, to be their defender, or had the law in my hand, to dispose
as I list, which would be as vnseemely, as an Asse to treade
the measures
                  •
                yet, if it were so, I would correct Mantuās Egloge,
intituled Alphus: or els if the Authour were aliue, I woulde not
doubt to perswade him in recompence of his errour, to frame a
new one: for surely though Euripides in his tragedies doth greatly
exclaim against that sexe, yet it was in his choller, and he inferred
a generall by a particular, which is absurd. He had an euyll
wife, what then? because the hill Canaros hath a fountayne runs
deadlye poyson, is al water nought? shall the fire be reiected, because
some one sparke fireth a whole whose? are the bodyes of
the flyes Cantharides to be cast away, because their legges are
poyson? shal we condemne al women of inconstancy, because Helena
was fickle? or all to be naught, because some one is a shrewe?
if the premises wil infer such a conclusiō, I refer me to their greatest
enemy. But for feare of a farther digression, againe to thē we
left at dinner, who after they had taken a suffycient repast, fell againe
to their former discourse, till Gonzaga returning home,
broke off their talke with his presence, entertaining Pharicles
very friendly, assuring him he was as welcome as he could wish
him selfe to be, which curtesie was not so heartily offred, as willingly
reciued. So that it seemed if the one were content, the other
was as well pleased. Yet Gonzaga being as wily as Pharicles
was wittie, desirous to smell the vane of the young Gentleman,
trayned his hooke with this bayte.
            
               Pharicles, quoth he, the old Fox that cannot spy the fetch of the
young one, was neuer crafty himself: the Goose that cannot see

the Gosling winke, may seeme to haue a defect of nature: he that
cannot see fire in straw, is surely stone blind: and hee that cannot
spy the flame of fancy, is but a foole. There is none wil so soone
spy one halting, as a cripple: it is hard to couer smoke, but more
hard to conceale loue. I my self both haue tryed it, and nowe I
likewise finde the proofe of it in you, who as closely as you keepe
your cloke, yet I spy the lining, for loue kept in secret is like the
spark couered with ashes, which at length bursteth into a great
flame. But if it be as I thinke, I am glad of it. As I haue taken
care Pharicles, to haue my daughter keep her virginity inuiolat
without spot of suspitiousnes, so would I be as willing to yeelde
the fruits of her chastity into the hands of some gentleman, whom
she might both like for loue, &amp; think wel offor his birth &amp; honesty,
rather wishing with Themistocles to marrye my daughter to a
man, thē to money: desiring likewise his choice to be for her goodnesse,
and not for her goodes, least if the knotte should be knit for
wealth, it might be disseuered for pouerty. Licurgus would haue
no dowries to be giuen with maides, least some should be liked for
riches, and others loathed for want. The maides of Essenea went
neuer bare faced, vntill they were maryed, least bewty should bee
of more force then honesty, esteeming her which was honest, neyther
to haue want of nature, nor lack of nurture: So that Pharicles,
I hope if you choose, it shal not be for wealth, which is vanitie;
nor for bewty, which is momentary (although I thank God
she can neither blame nature nor fortune) but onelye for vertue
which is permanent: for where the cause is durable, there the effect
must néedes be lasting, Loue ought to be like the stone Armenicke,
which is hardly inflamed, but once set on fire, is neuer
quenched: like the Emerauld, which being imprinted, neuer changeth
fourme without breaking. Surely, Pharicles, I speake
these wordes to you as a friende, and to Mamillia, as a father,
wishing well to you for good lyking, and to her by course of
kinde: being willing to marry my daughter, but neyther to buy
her an husband, nor to set her to sale, vnlesse the price bee loue, I
mean that I woulde not make the match by entreatie, nor seeme
to consente lyghtlye, least haste shoulde make waste.
            Therefore, Pharicles, although I speake largely, thinke not

my consent is any profer. For others of great byrth; and no small
wealth (I will make no comparisons) haue both made great
suite, and offered large feofmentes to haue my good wyll: yet
sith Mamillia did not loue, I did not lyke: and what shee doeth
nowe, I am not priuye to it: but if shee doe, my minde perhappes
may bee chaunged: for you knowe olde men are verye suspitious,
and I my selfe doubte by the dreade of others, wee are colde of
complexion, and therefore fearefull by nature, and will quicklye
spye a padde in the strawe, and a snake in the grasse, I perhappes
thinke the Moone is ecclipsed, when she is but chaunging; &amp; gesse
loue is lust, when it is loyaltie, falshood to bee fayth, and trueth to
be treason, iudging vpon meat with a sicke stomacke, and casting
wine with a furred tongue; construing al thinges by contraries,
through the imbecilitie of our witte: sith euery thing is the worse
for wearing: so ye he which wil court an old mans daughter, may
be curteous, &amp; yet thought curyous; his liberality may be thought
prodigalitie; his cleanlynesse, pride and vnthriftinesse, that, walke
as warilye as you can, the olde doter will suspect him.
            
               Pharicles, I speake against mine owne age, and confesse the
frayltie of my nature, that if you chaunce to finde the lyke faulte
in me, that you impute it not to peeuishnesse, but to course of
kinde: For you, Pharicles, professe loue to my daughter, and I
thinke it is but dissimulation: you faigne faith, and I doubt of flattery;
you seeme to offend in excesse, and I feare you faint in defect,
I feare more then you can forge, and all little ynough in my
iudgement. For you, young gentlemen, nowadayes lyke without
loue, and lust without lyking: you fancy euery face, and ech sundry
moneth you must haue a new mistresse, wooing as you think,
with great witte, and at length proues without wisdome, so that
as the seede is subtiltie, and the fruite folly, the haruest can reape
but little honesty. Pharicles, I inferre no particulars, I told you
my faulte, and therefore blame me not, if I cannot digresse from
nature, but speake what I thinke: for if your conscience be cleare,
it doeth not touch you; if it bee not, I am glad I haue spoken so
much, that eyther you may amende, or els make an ende: for if
my sight fayle me not, one you must doe.
            
               Pharicles being rubd on his gald backe, thought Gonzaga was

a subti
                  •
                Fox, and needed not to learne his occupation, and that he
could see the Gosling wink, being broad waking; but as young
wittes are rash, so they are ready; and can smell a tale beefore it be
half tolde: for Pharicles found his fetch at the first word, &amp; therefore
intending to be as wily, as he was wise, gaue false fire to his
peece, thereby to blinde Gonzagas eyes, as warily as hee coulde
looke and to winke, and yet not be spyed on this manner.
            Sir, quoth he, as it is hard to hide the smoake, so were he a foole
that would goe about to couer it, and if fancy must needes be spyed,
who would seeke to cloake it? nature cannot be restrained, nor
loue kept in secret: for the one will come to his course, and the other
seeme light amidst the darknes. I knowing this, (although
you mistake me) neuer thought to loue where I might not come
lawfully, nor to like, where eyther the person or place should haue
neede of a vale for Sunne burning: as for my selfe, I neede none:
therefore, sir, if I halt, it is outright, that more maye perceiue it
then a cryple. But I hope, iudge what you will, you shal find me
stand to my tackling, and to take my course so well by my compasse,
that I shall proue a cunning Pylot, and to shew my selfe so
chary in my choyse, what wares I chuse, that I shall bee a good
Chapman, and the better I trust, in that I haue your counsel. The
Lyons whelp taketh euer the fattest sheepe, when the old sire is
by: the fawne neuer makes so good choyse of his feede, as the old
Bucke; age speaketh by experience, and liketh by tryall, youth
leaneth vpon wit, which is voyd of wisdom. Where the old Faulcon
seaseth, there is euer the best pray: therefore he that will not
be ruled by age, shalbe decided by youth, and hee that will not
heare the admonition of a friend, shal perhaps feele the correctiō
of a foe. This causeth me to thank your counsel, although I was
determined before, for I neuer meant to loue without lasting nor
fancy for a time, least I my self might be the first should repent it,
but was fully resolued to lay my foundation vppon such a rock, as
neither the earthquakes of dissention, nor the tempestes of trouble
may once be able to moue. Now I know wel ynough, yt hee that
chooseth the carnation for colour, should find it to haue lesse vertue
then the black violet; yt the fading blossoms are more delectable to
the sight, then the lasting fruite; that the painters colours which

are most bright, will soonest loose their glose; yt nothing so soone
stayneth, as cloath of lighte colour; and nothing to be lesse permanent,
then the glasse of bewtie, which beginneth to decay in the
budde, to wither in the blossome, and if it commeth to be fruite, is
rotten before it be halfe ripe. The loue of bewtie, saith Anacreon
is the forgetting of reason, the enemy to wit, and to be counted indeede
a short frensie: for he that loueth onely for bewty, wil eyther
loath when age approcheth, or else soone be glutted with plentie:
wheras fancy fixed vpon vertue, encreaseth euer by continuance.
He yt putteth the Adder in his bosome, delighted with her golden
skin, is worthy to be euuenomed: the mouse, if she feede vpon rosealger
for the glistering hue, deserueth to be poysoned: if the fishe
will needes to the baight, because it is of flyes in Cātabria, it is
her own folly if she be taken: the bird that commeth to the glasse,
enticed by the brightnes, deserueth the net: he yt wil choose a fayre
face with euil conditions, claymeth by right to be counted a foole.
Cateline had not so much pleasure in the bewtie of Oristilla, as
he reaped sorow by her outragious crueltie, nor won so much credit
by her comlines, as Brutus did of his wife Porcia for her curtesie.
The husband of Sempronia for al her faire face, had a wife
of whom it was in question, whether she were more prodigall of
her purse, or liberal of her honestie, that I am sure he would haue
made a chang with Gracchus for his black wife Cornelia. Menelaus,
who had that earthly Goddesse Helena, reaped for euery
seede of pleasure, a whole haruest of sorow, contented to become
Captaine of Cornetto, &amp; for her comlynes to haue her almost cō
               mon,
being as infortunate in his choyce, as Glitio Gallus was
happy in his chance, by wedding Egnatia Maximilla: so that he
which maketh choyce of bewty without vertue commits as much
folly as Critius did, in choosing a golden boxe filled with rotten
bones. I therfore fearing the fetters by the captiuitie of the bondman,
was euer careful to like for the proportion of the body, and
loue for the qualities of the minde, neuer meaning to make a rusty
rapier my rampire of defence, though it haue a veluet scabbarde;
nor my choyce of any euil woman, be she neuer so proper of persō,
hauing peeuish conditions: least for euery ynch of ioy, I catch an
ell of annoy; and for euery drop of delight, a whole draught of despight.

This, I say, was the cause, Gonzaga, that forced me to repaire
vnto your daughter, because the fame of her exquisit perfection
by nature plentifully placed in her, hath rauished euen her enimies
hearts to loue &amp; like her: her grauity in gestures, her modesty
in manners, her curtesie in conuersation, chalenged my lybertie
and wonne my heart her own for euer. It was not the colour
in her cheekes, but the conditions of her mind; not her comelinesse,
but her curtesie, not her person, but her perfection that inchaunted
me. But why doe I seeke to try my selfe loyall, when
the hearers doe deeme me a lyar
                  •
                why doe I bring in reasons to
proue my troath, when my wordes can haue no trust, or to debate
the matter, when they thinke it daliaunce? well sir, I cannot let
you to think: but if I daly, it is in dolour; if I sport, it is in spight;
if I iest, it is without ioy; and so tract of tyme shall try it. You apply
this mistrust to your age, and suspition to your old brain: sure
you maye doe so: for I call the Gods to witnesses that the wordes
which I speake, and the loue I protest to Mamillia is verytie
without vanity, trueth without trifling: fayth without flattery, as
fine within, as fayre without; a siluer sheath with a golden dagger,
and in token she shal haue both lands and life, hand and heart, as
her own for euer.
            
               GOnzaga hearing the solemne protestation of the gentleman,
being as credulous as suspitious, thought, what the heart did
think, the tongue would clinck: and that his filed speech was without
fayning, and his sweete talke without sower tales, gaue him
his hand, that he was as glad to haue him to his sonne, as he desirous
of such a father, and that he conceaued a great contentation
of minde, that he found so fitte a match for his daughter: so that after
many pleasaunt parlees on both sides, they were fully betrothed
together. Pharicles promising the next spring to consummat
the marryage, and Gonzaga prouiding a courtly banquet to 
                  •
               eale
vp ye matter. Which being ended, Pharicles after many amiable
lookes and sweete kisses, gaue her the curteous conge, and departed
to his lodging no lesse contented, then if he had obtained Cresus
welth, Alexanders empire, or any treasure that fortune could
assigne vnto him.
            But the Sunne being at the highest, declyneth; the Sea, beeing

at full tide, ebbeth; caulme continueth not long without a
storme; neyther is happynesse had long without heauines, blysse
without bale, weale without woe, as by this new betrothed couple
may be seene, who now flowing in floudes of felitity are by
the falshood of Pharicles soused in the seas of sorrow, exalted to
the hyest degree of happines, are driuen to the greatest extremity
of euill, alate placed in paradise, and now plunged in perplexitie:
for he no sooner entred his study, but espying the cruell letter
of his mercilesse mistresse Publia, frying in fury, burning in rage
and turning his woonted loue to a present hate, euen as the dog
which byteth the stone; or the Bore that in chase teareth the trees;
so he in reuenge of his choller, thought to read ouer this Letter
more for spight then for pleasure; more for lothing then for loue.
But as the birde, when shee is moste carelesse is caught of the
fowler, so Pharicles reading in iest, found good earnest; and was
so caught in the hay and taken with the toyles, that his fancy was
fettered with a new charme, and his minde so amazed with this
new musing, that he bestowed all the night in examining particularly
euery line of her letter. And though the first part was sharp
and rigorous, yet he found the last to be mixed with mettal of more
mild matter, reading it ouer a thousande tymes, blaming his nature,
and condemning his choler in being so rash to refuse meate
at the first taste, to reiect the Orenge, because the pill was sower;
to disalow the loue of Publia, because she made chary of her chastitie,
his new plighted troath was almost wauering, and waying
at the first assault his feigned fancy, almost eclipsed through fading
folly, insomuch that the hope of his newe luste, had almoste
quenched the shew of his newe loue; the freendlye conclusion of
Publia, had well nigh raced out his fayth to Mamillia; the desire
of his fond affectiō so blinded his vnderstanding, ye he passed not to
peruert both humane &amp; diuine lawes: for the accōplishmēt therof:
no rules of reason, no feare of lawes, no prickes of conscience, no
respect of honesty, no regard of God or man, could prohibit him
frō his pestiferous purpose: for if lawes had bin of force, he knew
his deede was contrary to al lawes, in violating his sacred oath: if
conscience, he knew it terrible: if honesty, he knew wit most wicked:
if God or man, he knew it abhominable in the sight of both.
            
               
But too true it is, ye the force of loue, nay rather ye fury of lust, doth
neither care for kith nor kin, friend nor foe, God nor the diuell, as
this faithlesse Pharicles wil proue: who hauing shrined his heart
by solemn promises in the bulwark of Mamillias bountye, yeelded
with a fresh Alarm, giuen by the remēbrance of Publias bewtie,
shewing yt the cat wil to kinde: that the woolfe wil be a deuourer:
the fox wily, &amp; men deceitful: for nature must haue his course,
their loue is neuer guided by reason, but by rage: nor their fancy
by faith, but by fury: they burn in outward shape as hot as Aetna,
where their meere substance is as cold as Caucasus: their promises
are loyal, but the performance lasciuious: they import feruent
affection, but it proueth fleshly fancy: they are so giuē vnto guiles,
framed to forswearing, prone vnto periury, wedded vnto wickednes,
&amp; bowed vnto vanitie, that to say what I think, the most trusty
louer, that they make most account of, if he were throughly sifted,
would shrink in the wetting, &amp; proue a leud leachour: so that shee
which yeeldeth her self vnder y• curteous countenance of an iniurious
man, is cōmonly so wrapped in the waues of wiles, y• she is
drowned at ye length in the deapth of deceit, &amp; hardly escaped with
the losse of his libertie, vnlesse they smell them betimes: which is
hard to doe: for in their wooing, they counterfeit simplicitie, and
in their wedding they shewe their subtiltie, while they are sutors,
they are saints: but being sold, they are serpents: they wil beare a
painted sheath, with a rusty blade: a faire blossom, but rotten fruit:
&amp; Doues they wil needes be, when indeede they be diuels. But againe
to our Gentleman, whose careful minde was so tossed with
the tempests of contrary cogitations, that as the vessell born with
the tyde against the wind feeleth dubble force, and is compelled to
yeelde to winde and waue: so Pharicles driuen by the force of
lust, against the lawes of loue, felt dubble dolour, and was so diuersly
tormented, that he fel into these tearmes.
            Of al euil, which either God or nature hath layed vpon man,
there is noone so great, but either reason may redres, pleasure asswage,
or mirth mittigate, hearbes heale, or by some meanes or other
be cured: Loue only excepted, whose furious force is so ful of
rancor, that phisick can in no respect preuaile to helpe the patient,
deseruing not ye name of a disease, but of an incurable mischiefe:

yet importing such a shew of goodnes, that it so inflameth our desire
to purchase it, yt we wil not care to buy it at an vnreasonable
rate: Which loue hath takē such deep roote in me, as neither reasō
can rule, nor wisdom wield: it is so ranckled with rage, &amp; infected
with frātick folly, frantick I may wel term it, sith it is so light, as
it seemeth to come without liking: so momētary, as it sheweth no
modesty: so vnconstant, yt it hath no one iot of continuance: so diuers,
as it may well be called diuelish, more brittle then a broken
glas: more wauering thē ye wethercock: more variable in thought
then ye Camelion in hue: more changable in deede thē the nightingale
in voyce: now liking, now lothing: now fire
                  •
                now frost: colde
before I am hot: &amp; hot at the first dash. O fickle loue, fraught with
frailty. O traiterous hart ful of trechery. O cursed conscience, altogether
careles. O miserable wretch wrapped in wickednes:
shal I requit ye liberal loue of Mamillia with such disloyalty, returning
as ye dog to my vomit in liking Publia? shal I deceiue ye
opiniō, that both she &amp; her father conceaued in me, with such detestable
vill any? shal I return ye trust they put in me, with such treasō:
shal I defile my fayth towards her with such forged falshood?
shal I 
                  〈◊〉
                so new fangle to leaue ye one so lewdly, &amp; loue the other
so lightly it is a cōmon saying, that chang is seldom made for the
better, &amp; he is a foole, they say, that will bily ye pig in the poke: or
wed a wife without trial: or setle loue without time. What a madnes
were it then, to make such an il market, to chop &amp; chang, and
liue by ye losse: to refuse Mamillia without reason, &amp; chuse Publia
without trial: to reiect assurance for incertainty: to fish for hope,
where I may satisfie my self with trust: to venture vpon one, of
whom I haue had no proof (but if there be so much) a litle trifling
loue? Wel, those whelps are euer blind, that dogs beget in hast: ye
seed too timely sown hath euer smal increase: he that leaps before
he looke, may hap to light in ye ditch: he that settles his affection in
such speed, as he makes his choyce without discretiō: for his hasty
choosing, may perchāce get a heauy bargain. Tush, he that seekes
to restrain loue, kicks againe the prick: he stops ye stream. &amp; beates
the fire downward, he wil make necessity to haue a law, &amp; cause
Bālams Asse to speak: for loue is aboue king or keisar, Lorde or
lawes, yea euen aboue ye Gods thēselues: if it be then so stronge;

why is it not then more stedfast? if it be so forcible, why is it not
fixed? perhaps so it is in al sauing me: I am y• od person, I am that
one particular, on whom Cupid wil shew his craft, &amp; decipher his
nature: in whom al the contrarieties of loue wil work their contrary
passions, on whom Venus will vaunt for her vaine bassall,
as one ready to strike at euery stale, to come at euery cal, to light
on euery lure, yea, and almost scase on the emptie fiste, neyther
regarding the ware, nor the price: but leauing the force for the
first assaulte of fancye. Oh Gods, how foolishly doe I fable? how
my talke enforced by rage, is altogether without reason? can I
striue agaynst that which is styrred by the Starres? can I peruert
that which is placed by the Planettes? can I driue out that,
which is decreed by the destinies 
                  •
               or shewe force in that, which
is fixed by the fates? No, no, Pharicles, assure thy selfe, this thy
chaunge is by the charge of the Gods, and thy newe lyking to
some greater ende: perhappes they will preuent by the meanes
of Publia some greate inconuenience, which should light vpon
thee in matching with Mamillia. Aeneas, had he not setled his
minde vpon Dido? yea, and celebrated the rites of matrimonys
was bee not warned by the Gods in a dreame, to falsefie his fayth
                  •
               
&amp; lay his loue vpon Lauinia? who did more for Iason thē 
               Medea?
yet hee was driuen by the destinies to forsake her, and fixe his
fancy vpon Creusa to whome he was constant to the ende. 
                  〈◊〉
               
               Theseus, by the admonition of Bacchus, left Ariadne, and was
forced by the fates to fancy Phechia, with whome hee remayned
as loyall, as light vnto the other: so perhaps I am forced by nature
and destinie to loth Mamillia, and like Publia: and if it bee
so, all is well: for Aristotle saieth, that nature nor fate neuer
framed any thing amisse: and though I offend in lyking the one
lightly, yet I wil make amends in louing the other more firmly: if
the world shal wonder at my faining to the one, they shal meruail
as much at my fayth to the other: if abmen talk of my trechery to
Mamillia, they shal speak as much of my troath to Publia. Now
haue I surely setled my self, neuer frō henceforth to lend a louing
looke to Mamillia. Publia shalbe the planet, wherby to direct my
doings: she shalbe the star, shal guid my compas: she shal be the hauen,
to harbor in: the saint at whose shrine I meane to offer my deuotion.
            
               
I wil now put al fear aside: for a faint hart was neuer fauoured of
fortune: the coward that feareth ye crack of the canon, will neuer
proue a couragious captaine, nor vaunt himself of victory: the dastard
that dreadeth the noyse of the drum, will neuer come in the
skirmish, nor were y• flag of triumph: the louer that heareth such a
calm conscience, as for fear of his credit, dare not match vnder the
dissēbling stādard of Cupids camp, shal neuer be proclaimed heire
apparāt to Venus kingdō. Therfore sith I haue setled &amp; decreed,
I will make no delay, for feare the grasse be cut from vnder my
feet: but either by words or writing sēd an answer to my new mistres:
and with that he tooke his pen, and sent her this Letter.
            
               
                  Pharicles to Publia.
                  THe phisitiō, mistres Publia, yt letteth the sicke patient blood
for the Plurysie, when tracte of tyme hath made the disease
incurable, defendeth the walles when the Citty is ouerrunne:
salues seldome helpe an ouerlonge suffered sore: it is too late to
bring the ruine of battery, whē the wals are already broken: that

                     ge loue out of ones breast, whē it hath before infected euery
part of the body. The surgion, when the festring Fistuloe hath by
long continuance made the sound flesh rotten, can neither with le

                     iue
plaistets, nor cutting corasiues be cured: so loue craueth but
only time to bring the body &amp; mind to bondage. So your seemely
self seeing me fettred in y• chain of fancy, &amp; fast boūd in the bāds of
your bewty, haue sent me pils of hard disgestiō, to asswage ye force
of my loue, &amp; mitigate the firmnes of my fancy: but as the byting
of a viper ranckleth &amp; rageth, til he hath brought the body bittē to
bain, so the sight of your cōely persō hath so pearced euery vain wt 
the sting of loue, yt neither the sowernes of the sauce, nor sharpnes
of the salue, can in any wise preuaile: onely the milde medicine of
your mercy may salue the sore, &amp; cut away the cause of my careful
disease. Sith therfore mistres Publia, it is in your power either to
exalt me to ye highest degree of happines, or driue me down to the
deepest bottom of bitter bale: to place me in the princely pallace of
earthly paradise, or plunge me in the pit of perplexity: way my
cause equally in the scales of honesty &amp; equity, &amp; yeeld me but according
vnto iustice, which am a careful client at bewties bar: that
is, to giue according to my desert, and the desert of loue, is loue againe.

And although the shortnes of time hath made no trial to procure
anye great trust, yet I hope the clearnes of my conscience in
that case, &amp; the firmnes of my faith, will in time force the trueth to
flame bright, amidst the darkest mists of distrust: &amp; againe the scalding
sighes &amp; piteous plaints &amp; praiers that I haue powred out to
the Gods, that they might chang your hart &amp; settled vow of chart

                     tie,
I hope when they shal take effect, that they wil be witnesses of
my good wil. For since the receit of your letters, if my words cā
                     not
be taken for witnesses, yet the praiers, processions, pilgrimages,
offers &amp; vowes that I haue made vnto the Gods, if they graūt
my petition, wil testifie the ioy I conceiued in the curteous clause
of your letters, although I was almost foundred for fear, couered
with care, &amp; daunted with dread, at the rigorous sight of your first
lines. But as I was neuer of that minde, to count him a couragious
captain, that at the first shot of the canon would yeeld the ke

combat were, the more hauty wer the conquest: the more doubtful
the fight, the more worthy the victory: ye more paine I should take
about the battery, the more pleasure to win the bulwork of your
brest: which if I should abtain, I would count it a more rich price,
then euer Scipio, or any of the nine worthy won by conquest, And

of froward fortune, &amp; throwd me frō ye bitter blasts of bale? Shal
I repent me, sith my bargain is good, or complain of the losse of liberty,
sith I haue made a chang for a more worthy thing? shall I
grudge when the gods are agreed, or defer it, sith ye destinies driue
it; or frown, sith my fortune frames it? no, Pharicles is my saint, &amp;
him wil I serue? he is my ioy, &amp; him will I enioy: he hath laid the
siege, &amp; he shal fack ye citie: he hath abod the battery, &amp; he shal haue
the bulwark of my breast: he hath fought the combat, &amp; he shall be
victor in the cōquest: for I cannot be so vnnaturall to reward his
loue with lothing, so wout reasō to defraud him of his right, so diuelish,
for his deepe desire, to giue him a dolful dish of dispair. No,
no, I haue setled with my self, ye if euer I marry, Pharicles shalbe
the man I wil match with: &amp; therfore, as I haue driuē him with delaies,
&amp; fed him wt folly: so now I wil send him a setled answer of
my good wil &amp; fauour: as I haue giuē him cutting corasiues, so I
wil sēd him cōfects of comfort: as I haue bin fearful to shew my
liking for y• better trial so now wil I be bold to shew my loue in tokē:

not Pharicles say, himself, that where the conquest is doubtful, the
vicory, is most to be counted? yt castle that hath longest battery, is
thought the richer booty? are not those pearles which are scarsly
found, &amp; hardly gattē ouer of the greatest value? the spice, which y•

come by, warily kept. The maid that by long suit &amp; much trauaile
is obtained, by how much the more she was hard in the getting, by
so much the more she wil be sweet in the wearing: she, which in her
virginity is chary of her chastity, in her mariage wil be as wary of
her honesty: therfore I wil send Pharicles such a potion, as shal be
sower in the mouth, &amp; sweet in the maw, sharpe in eating, &amp; plesāt
in disgesting. And with that she sent him a letter, to this effect.

                  IT is hard M. Pharicles to purchase credit by the praise of any

y• moulde, for her sight: the dolphin, for his straight back: sith lack
of such perfection in thē, condēnes thy praiser for a parasit? I, therfore
knowing in my self no desert to driue you to such deep desire
as you profes, am the hardlyer induced to beleeue your words: because
ye meanes of my bewty merits no such praise, as you attribut
vnto it, it procureth lesse credit to your talk, so that I take thē forwords
of course, rather thē for tales of truth, thinking &amp; fearing to
find in yt fairest rose, a foule canker: &amp; in finest speech, foulest falshood.
It is giuē to ye wolf by nature, to be cruel: to the lion, to be
fierce: to the fox subtilnes: &amp; as wel it is ingrafted in man, both by
nature &amp; eduratiō, to be dissēbling: so yt it is a setled sētēce amōgst

words bring a maide into a fooles paradise, cannot loue. These
things, &amp; these faigned flatteries of men considered, Pharicles, wt
the smal acquaintance I haue with you, mightiustly driue me into
the deep den of distrust, &amp; almost sink me in the surging seas of suspition:
but yt the secret goodwil we I haue borne you long time,
wil neither suffer me to cōceaue such mistrust, nor to conceale any
longer ye fire of my fancy, but must of necessity giue place, wher y•
flam bursteth forth by force. Think therfore Pharicles, yt the sowersauce
I sēt you, was to cast your stomack: that the salues of suspect
was to search the sores of dissimulatiō: y• the taints of distrust was
to feel the depth of the wound: that my denial was for the greater
trial: that my straitnes in words was no strāgnes in mind, but to
try the truth of your goodwil: for if the sower taste of my talk had
quatted your stomack, I wold haue thoght it altogether queasy: if
the salues of suspect had foūd the sore but a smal blam: if the taints
had tried the woūd ful of dead flesh: or if one daūt of denial had eased
your courage, &amp; proued you as crauēly a coward, as ye vētrous
knight, yt finding the first encoūter cōbersō, giueth ouer the quest:
thē might I wel haue thought your loue light, your fancy fickle,
your faith fading, as il to be liked, &amp; worse to be blamed, then the
hound, which at the first default giueth ouer the chase: but sith you
stood to your tackling amidst the deepest waues of denial

whose stomack is but quasie: yet as the wind after often changing
remaineth long in one quarter: so Pharicles, in amēds of his fleeting
fancy towards Marmillia, determined to be alwaies constant
with Publia. Which determination had such euill successe, as it
was the cause of his exile: for after he knew Mamillia heard of his
dissēbling, he cōueied himself closly into Sicillia, traueling forthen
his iourney, pilgrim like: but wher his intēt was to remain, no mā
