            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO ALL GENTLEMEN, MERchants, Apprentises, Farmers, and plaine countrimen, health.
            
            
               IT is most true, Gentlemen, and wofull experience dayly teacheth vs, that the more carefull Princes are in erecting &amp; establishing good lawes, for the rooting out of vice in the common wealth, the more repugnant (the diuell altogether predominant ouer them) do euil disposed persons, caterpillers, and the off-scumme of the world (and therfore to be reiected and excommunicated from the fellowship of all honest men) oppose themselues against God and good gouernement, and in steede of an honest and ciuill cariage (which the Lawe prescribes them) betake them to a most hatefull, vicious, and detestable life: Who, as they may well be compared to vipers, most venimous and spitefull beasts, that for their venime and poison are hated and shunned of all men, as most preiudiciall creatures: so these base people, not once thinking of an honest course of life, trusting vpon their owne mother wits, dayly deuise newe shifts and policies, to fleece the plaine dealing man, and by that meanes growe into more hate amongst honest men, then do the hated Iewes at this day: and the name of Conicatchers is so odious, that now a dayes it is had vp, and vsed for an opprobrious name for euerie one that sheweth the least occasion of deceit. The bookes that were not long ago set forth, concerning Coniecatching and crosse-biting, and the discouerie of each (if anie sparke of grace were) might haue beene so manie restraints

and bridles to call them from that abominable life, but they that are giuen ouer to their owne hearts lust, with all their might inueigh both against them and their Authour.
            I haue therefore, Gentlemen, as one inforced (amore patriae) taken in hand to publish this little Pamphlet (which by a very friend came by a chance to my hands, and adding somewhat of mine owne knowledge, and vpon verie credible information) most necessarie in my mind for the good of the common wealth, both for all men to see, what grosse villanies are now practised in the bright Sunne-shine, that thereby they may be forewarned to take heede how they conuerse with such cosoning companions: as also a iust checke and controll to such wicked liuers, that they perceiuing their goodnesse set abroch, may with remorse and penitencie forsake their abominable course of life, and betake them to a more honest and ciuill behauiour. If any with the spider heere seeke to sucke poison, let such a one take heede, that in practising his villany he chaunce commence Bachelor in Whittington Colledge, and so in good time take his degrees and proceede Doctor, and thence with a solemne procession take possession of doctor Stories cappe; to which some of the worshipfull companie of Conicatchers haue worthily heretofore attained.
            In this Treatise (louing countrimen) you shall see what shifts this crue of helhounds haue put in practise since the bookes of Conicatching came forth vnder these names. viz. The Art of Humoring. The Art of carrying stones; W. St Lift. Ia. lame. Ned Br. catch, and Blacke Robins kindnesse: Wherin are manifested the nature of Humorists, such as can insinuate themselues into euerie mans companie: &amp; as they see him addicted, so will they verse vpon him, what policies they haue to purloine goods out of shops vnder the pretence of plainnesse, what shifts they haue to cosen poore Alewiues, by the art of carrying stones, what inconuenience may come by following slattering strumpets, I know not I what should be the cause why so innumerable harlots and Curtizans abide about London, but because that good lawes are not looked vnto: is there not one appointed for the apprehending of such hellmoths,

that eat a man out of bodie &amp; soule? And yet there be more notorious strumpets &amp; their mates about the Citie and the suburbs, then euer were before the Marshall was appointed: idle mates I meane, that vnder the habit of a Gentleman or seruing man, think themselues free from the whip, although they can giue no honest account of their life. I could wish, and so it is to be wished of euery honest subiect, that Amasis lawe were receiued, who ordained that euerie man at the yeares end should giue an account to the Magistrate how hee liued, and he that did not so, or could not make an account of an honest life to be put to death as a fellon, without fauor or pardon: What then should become of a number of our vpstart gallants, that liue only by the sweate of other mens browes, and are the decay of the sorwardest Gentlemen and best wits? Then should we haue fewer conicatching strumpets, who are the verie causes of all the plagues that happen to this flourishing common wealth. They are the destruction of so manie Gentlemen in England. By them many Lordships come to ruine. What dangers growe by dallying with such vnchast Libertines, and what inconuenience followes by their inordinat Pleasures, let those that haue had wofull experience and maister Surgeon together testifie: nay, they not onely indanger the bodie by lothsom diseases, but ingraue a perpetuall shame in the forehead of the partie, and finally consume his soule and make him fit for the diuell.
            To leaue these base companions (that can by no wholsom counsell, nor aduised perswasions bee disswaded from their lothsom kind of lise, nor called to any honest course of liuing) in the dregges of their dishonesty. Would it please the honorable and worshipfull of the land to take order for the cutting off of these cosoners, and consuming cankers of this common wealth, they should not only cause a blessing to be powred on this flourishing state, but haue the prayers of euery good subiect for their prosperous health: and welfare. And thus Gentlemen, I conclude with this farewell: God either conuert or confound such base companions.
            
               Yours to vse, S. R.

                  VSe and peruse not with a curious eye,
               For Truth oft's blamde, yet neuer telleth lie.
               I tell not I, what forraine men haue done,
               But follow that which others haue begun.
               No learned Clearke in Schooles that vse to write,
               But Enuie makes their labours some to spite.
               What then shall I, that write a homely stile,
               Thinke but to haue a homely scoffing smile.
               But these and those that either mocke or skorne,
               Would they might weare (faire sight) Acteons horne.
               But you kind friends, that loue your countries wealth,
               Vouch of my labours, good fortune guide your health.
               To pleasure most, and profit all's my end,
               My greatest care to please both foe and friend.
               Reade then kind friends, my trauell heere you haue,
               I looke for nought, nought but your loues I craue.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            GREENES GHOST haunting Conicatchers.
            
               THere hath béene of late daies published two merrie and pithie Pamphlets of the arte of Conicatching: wherin the Author hath sufficiently expressed his experiēce, as also his loue to his Countrie. Neuerthelesse with the Authors leaue, I will ouerlooke some lawe tearmes expressed in the first part of Conicatching: whereunto, as the Author saith, is necessarilie required thrée parties: The setter, the Verser, and the Barnacle. Indéed I haue heard some retainers to this ancient trade dispute of his procéedings in this case, and by them in a full Synode of quart pots it was thorowlie examined and concluded, that there were no such names, as he hath set downe, nor anie cheating Arte so christened as Conicatching. Marie, in effect there is the like vnderhand traffique daylie vsed and experienced among some fewe start vp Gallants disperst about the suburbs of London, who tearmes him that drawes the fish to the bait, the Beater, and not the Setter: the Tauerne where they go, the Bush, and the foole so caught, the Bird. As for Conicatching, they cleape it Batfowling, the wine the Strap, and the cards the Limetwigs. Now for the compassing of a woodcocke to worke on, and the fetching him into the wine bench of his wracke, is right beating the bush. The good asse is he will be dealt vpon, stouping to the lure if he be so wise as to kéep aloofe, a Haggard: and he whom

he makes Verser the Reiciuer, and the Barnacle the Pothunter.
            
            But all this breakes no square, so long as we concurre in eodem subiecto: yet I wish, that as he hath looked into these wicked actions opened therein, so he had also looked into other grosse sinnes, which are séeded in the hearts of sundrie persons. Extortion had béene a large theame to haue wrought vpon: and with the Usurers bagges full of gold he might haue handled another pretie Treatise: He might haue brought forth Justice weying bread, and the Baker putting his eares in the ballance to make euen weight. He should haue personated the Thames most pitifully complaining, what monstrous hauocke the Brewers make of her water, without all remorse or compassion: and how they put in willowe leaues and broome buds into their woort in steed of hoppes. So likewise a Christian exhortation to mother Bunch would not haue done amisse, that she should not mixe lime with her Ale, to make it mightie, or cozen the Quéenes liege people of their drink, by fubbing them off with these

But at this time I am not so prouided of monie as I would: therfore I can make no promise: and if a man should aduenture vpon such a iourney without money, it were miserable and base, and no man will care for vs.

To this he listens a little, and saith, These are some hopes yet, but if he should goe with you, and you haue monie, and he none, you will dominéere ouer him at your pleasure, &amp; then he were wel set vp to leaue such possibilities in Englād, &amp; be made a slaue in another countrie.

            In this sort haue I knowne sundrie young Gentlemen of England trained forth to their owne destruction, which makes me the more willing to publish this discourse,

the better to forewarne other of such Batfowling companions; as also for the rooting out of these insinuating moth-wormes that eate men out of their substance vnseene, and are the decaie of the forwardest Gentlemen and best wits.
            How manis haue we about London, ye to the disgrace of Gentlemen liue gentleman like of themselues hauing neither mony nor land, nor any lawful means to maintain them, some by play, and then they go a mumming into the countrie all the Christmas time with false dice, or if there be anie place where Gentlemen or merchants frequent in the Citis, or anie towne corporate, thither will they, either disguised like to yong merchants, or substantiall Citizens, and draw them all drie that euer dealt with them.
            There are some that doe nothing but walke vp and downe Paules, or come to shops to buy wares, with budgets of writings vnder their armes: and these will vrge talke with anie man about their sutes in law, and discourse vnto them how these and these mens bands they haue for money, that are the chiefest dealers in London, Norwich, Bristow, and such like places, and complaine that they can not get one pennie. Why, if such a one

O saith my budgetman, I haue his hand and seale to shewe, looke héere els: and with that pluckes out a counterfeit band (as all other his writings are) and reades it to him. Whereupon for halfe in halfe they presently compound, and after that hee hath that ten pounds paid him for his band of twentie besides the forfeiture, or so forth, he sayes, Faith these Lawyers drinke me as drie as a sieue, and I haue mony to pay at such a daie, and I doubt I shall not be able to compasse it: here are all the leases and euidences of my land lying in such a shire, I would you would lend me fortie pounds on them till the ne

marks a yeare.
            The wealthie retailer, citizen, merchant, Gentleman or young nouice that hath store of crownes lying by him, gréedy of such a bargaine, thinking perhaps by one clause or other to defeat him of all he hath, lends him the mony, and takes a faire statute merchant of his lands before a Iudge, but when all comes to all, he hath no more land in England then seuen foote in the Church yard, neither is his inheritance either in Posse or Esse, then a paire of gallowes in a gréene field, nor do anie such occupiers knowe him, much lesse owe him anie money, whereby the couetous person is cheated fortie or fiftie pounds thick at one clap.
            Not vnlike to these are they, that comming to Ordinaries about the Exchange where Merchants do table for the most part, will saie they haue two or thrée ships of coales late come from Newcastle, and wish they could light on a good chapman that would deale for them altogether. What is your price, saith one? What's your price, saith another? He holds them at the first at a very high rate, and sets a good face on it, as though he had such traffique indéed, but afterward comes downe so low, y• euerie man striues

he with all spéed, hauing the cloake vnder his arme, crying, Ho father, father, leauing the Scriuener yet writing his letter, who mist not his cloake till a great while after, that he saw him not returne againe.
               There is a cunninger kind of List, when a Batfowler walking in an euening in the stréetes, will faine he hath let fall a ring or a Iewell, and come to a shop well furnished with wares, and desire the prentise of the house to lend his candle to looke it: he suspecteth no guile, lends it him: and the Batfowler goes poaring vp and downe by the doores, as if he had lost something in déed, by and by he lets the candle fal to and it goes out. Now I pray you good yong man, saith he, do so much as light me this candle againe: so goes the fellow in to light the candle, while hee steales what he will out of the shop, and gets him going while the light commeth.
               There is a Lift called Will. St. Lift, whose maner is to go vp and downe to Faires in a blew coate, sometimes in his doublet and hose, and sometimes in a cloake, which commonly he puts off when he comes thither: this fellow waiteth diligently when any rich yeoman, Gentleman, or gentlewoman goes into an Inne to laie vp his cloak, capcase, sauegard, Portmantua or any other luggage, so following them, marks to whom they are deliuered: then comes he within halfe an houre after puffing and blowing for the cloake, capcase, portmantua, sword, or such like, and in his maisters name demandeth it, giuing the wife, maid, tapster, hostler, or some of the house two pence or a groate for laying it vp. Which hauing receiued, he is soone gone, and neuer returneth. This fellow will sometime stand bareheaded, and offer to hold a Gentlemans stirop, and verie diligently attend vpon him when he alighteth at anie great Inne, and séemeth so seruiceable, as if he were an hostler or chamberlaine belonging to the house: yea and sometimes follow him out of doores as his man, and attend vpon him to the Faire very orderly: within halfe an houre after, when he sées his new maister is so

               BEsides this, there is a kind of Lift called Chopchain, as when a Gentleman like a batfowler hath hired a chain for a day or two vpon his credit, or hath some of his friends bound for the restoring of it againe, goes to S.

               How a man was cosoned in the euening by buying a guilt spoone.
               VVHilest I was writing this, I was giuen to vnderstand of another like exploit nothing 
                     〈◊〉
                   to any of the former. A fellowe like a clowne that knew all points in his tables, and had béene maister of

his trade manie yeares together, walking through Siluer stréete in London suddenly in the dark spurned a faire gilt spoone (as it séemed) being wrapt vp in a paper, which before he purposely let fall: the people thinking some other had lost it, and that it had béene his good luck aboue the rest to find it, gan to flocke about him for to looke on it, and admired his fortune in méeting with it, hee counterfeiting the simple foole as well as he could: Now a Gods will what shall I do with such a Gugaw? would some other bodie had found it for me, for I know not what it is good for. Why, said one of the standers by, wilt thou take money for it? I, quoth he, I would I had a crowne for it. And I will come somwhat néere you, saith the other, for thou shalt haue all the money in my purse, which is foure shillings, so forth he drewe his purse, and gaue him the money. And verie well content with the bargaiue, he put it vp, and said I marie, this money will doe me more good then twentie spoones, and let them kéepe such toies that list, for I had rather haue one groat in my purse then a cart loade of such trumperie. So away he went laughing in hi

                   sléeue, to thinke how he had cosoned him that thought to ouerreach him: &amp; he that was so cosoned, as it were triumphing at his bargaine, could neuer looke enough on the spoone, but went presently and caried it to the Goldsmith, to know what it was worth. Birlady sir when he came thither, the spoone was found to be but brasse faire gilded ouer, and worth but seuen pence at the: most, if he should sell it, which was a heauie cooling card to his heart, and made him sweare, that for that spoones sake he would neuer be in his plate againe while he liued.

And this in anie case they set downe for a generall rule, that they lie not aboue two moneths in one place, for longer the alescore is not able to hold out, and the poore man ouerpressed so excessiuely, in a malecontent humour will rather grow desperate, and not care for anie danger they can bring him to, then suffer more then flesh and bloud can endure, or not rather haue his will on them for vsing him so badly.

She starting sodainly out of her sléepe, arose and went to the window to looke out: wherewith she crying out to him, said, that a Justice was at the doore with a companie of billes, and came to search for a seminarie Priest, and that there was no remedie but she must open vnto them: wherefore either he must rise and locke himselfe in a studie that was hard by, or they should be both caried to Bridewell. The poore silly youth in a trance, as one new start out of sléep, and that knew not where he was, suffered her to leade him whither she would, who hastily thrust him into th

               NOw Gentlemen, will you giue me leaue to dallie a little for your further recreation, &amp; I will proue vnto you that a dogge is a dangerous man, and not to be dealt withall: yea he is such a kind of creature that he may well be master and gouernour ouer all ordinary beasts: for first and formost, there is no man of experience that will denie but dogs do excell in outward sence, for they will smell better then we, and therby hunt the game when they sée it not. Besides, they get the fight of it better then we, and are wonderfull quicke of hearing. But let vs come to speech, which is either inward or outward. Now that they haue outward spéech I make no question, although we cannot vnderstand them, for they bark as good old Saron as may be; yea they haue it in more daintie maner thā we, for they haue one kind of voice in the chase, and another when they are beaten, and another when they fight. That they haue the inward spéech of mind, which is chiefly conuersant in those things which agrée with our nature, or are most against it, in knowing those things which stand vs most in steed, &amp; attaining those vertues which belong to our proper life, and are m

Yea, there be of them as of men of all occupations, some Cariers, and they will fetch; some watermen, and they will diue and swim when you bid them; some butchers, and they will kill shéepe; some cookes, and they turne the spit.

Then if they haue Justice, they haue all the vertues, since this is an Axioma in Philosophy, that one vertue cannot be separated from another.
               Further, we see they are full of magnanimitie, in incountring their enemies. They are wise, as Homer witnesseth, who entreating of the returne of Vlysles to his owne house, affirmeth that all his houshold had forgotten him but his dogge Argus, and him neither could Pallas by her s

Haue you not a well (quoth hee) on the backe side of your house that stands thus, and thus, for mine owne part I was neuer there (that I can tell of) to see. Yes that I haue, sayd the Hoste.

               ets. Wherefore he perswaded his wife to disclose her selfe to him, and to dispence with a little inconuenience, so they may be resolued of so rare a secret. But this was Doctor Pinchbackes drift, hee thought to haue shifted the Gentleman off by this extraordinarie imposition, thinking he would rather haue surceased his sute, then anie waie haue suffered him to sée his wife naked. In conclusion a chamber was prepared warme and close, in which she shewed her selfe, &amp; twise walked vp and down the chamber naked in the presence of M. Doctor and her husband, who demanded M. Doctors answer to his former question, which was as followeth: Quoth he, from meward it is a boy, and to me ward it is a girle: other answer they could get none of him. Wherefore the Gentleman was greatly offended against him, calling him Asse, Dolt, Patch, Cockescombe, Knaue, and all the base names he could deuise. But awaie went maister Doctor as skilfull in those cases as a blind man when he throweth his staffe: and durst not answer the Gentleman one word. And the Gentleman greatly repented him that he had been so foolish to shew his wife in that sort before so sottish a companion.
            About foure dayes after the Gentlewoman fell in labour, and was deliuered of a boy and a girle: whereat the Gentleman remembring the blunt answer of the Doctor, and finding it to be true, was greatly astonished, supposing indéed hee had mightily wronged the Doctor: to whom he went immediately crauing pardon for his former follie, shewing himselfe verie sorowfull for his fault, and offered him in recompence of amends all the fauour he might possibly doe him, granting to him his house at commandement, and his boord for so long time as he would continue with him. Wherupon in signe of loue and amitie he went and soiourned at the Gentlemans house: Whereupon the Doctors

credit still more and more began to increase, so that all the countrie round about told no small tales of the great running of Doctor Pinchbacke, to whom they resorted early ano late.
            It fortuned soone after shere was a Faire neere to the Gentlemans house, where the people diuersly talked of the Doctors skill and cunni

I will my selfe goe personally to him, and hold something in my hand, and if hee tell me what it is I will lose my money. I take you, sayd one or two, and the wager being layd, awaie they went towards the Gentlemans house: and passing thorough a meadow, the man tooke vp a Grashopper out of the grasse, and put it into his hand, so close that no man might perceiue it. Then forward they went, and met with Maister Doctor, and they desired him to satis
