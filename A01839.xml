            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  Enter, Bassaes Isaack▪
                      with a Crowne in his hand, Mustapha with a
Scepter, Mesithes with a Sword, they Crowne Corcutus youngest
sonne to Baiazet.
                  
                  
                     Isaack.
                     LEt the world feele thee, and those Demigods,
                     Proud with the name of Kings, debase themselues
                     To honour thee, this Crowne commands as much
                     He crowns him.
                     Wherewith I doe invest thy happy brow,
                     Happy indeed if that succeeding times
                     Shall set vp vertue, so to lessen crimes.
                     Thus from the ashes of dead Solyman
                     
                     Is raised another Phoenix great Corcutus;
                     
                     Liue equally adored, when Princes bend
                     To better courses, all their subiects mend.
                  
                  
                     Must.
                     Crowns make not Kings, nor can that glittering shew
                     Perfect thine honour, take another signe
                     Giues him the Scepter.
                     Of thy Imperiall dignity, 'tis thine.
                     That addes a God-like grace vnto thy brow,
                     This binds due honour, that prostrates euery knee
                     Before thy throne, then liue, and may that arme
                     Secure thy subiects from all forraigne harme.
                  
                  
                     
                     Mesith.
                     What seasoned knowledge, learnings prudent Queen
                     Hath blest thee with, must now initiate thee
                     In the pathes of warre, all studied Arts
                     Are but degrees vnto some wished end▪
                     
                     And steps of hope whereby we doe ascend
                     Vnto the top; and leuell of our thoughts.
                     But Kings then proue most happy when they are
                     Watchfull in peace, and prouident in warre.
                     Those are their vtmost ends, which that they may
                     O're-take, Art, and the sword, make fairest way.

                     The pleasant iuice of learning from their brests,
                     In thy first non-age; here then we bestow
                     The second helpe, to which good Princes owe
                     Much of their welfare; swords are the first ground
                     Of peace, and warre; they both defend and wound.
                     Thus are we vow'd to thee, let thy dread fame
                     Thunder amazement through the spatious world,
                     That when thou lifts thine arme, thy foes may say

                     Isa.
                     But you must heare.
                     Your brother Zemes, when swift winged Fame
                     Tolde him your father Mahomet was dead,
                     Flew quickly hither first to celebrate
                     His funerall pompe, then to assume his State,
                     His Crowne, and Scepter: which he rightly knew,
                     Vnto your hand, and head, both to be due.
                     But when applausiue ioyes, and peales of mirth,
                     Sounded loud Mosique in his troubled eares,
                     Of you enthron'd; then he began too late
                     To brawle at heauen, and wrangle with his Fate.
                     So he went hence and cried; reuenge be mine:
                     Quake thou great Citie of proud Constantine
                     
                     At my fierce anger, when I next returne,

                     Thy breath, and dull thy beauty with it's smoake.
                     This posted he hence to Armenias King,
                     There to implore his ayde, which he will bring
                     To front thy power: nor doth he yet dispaire,
                     To dispossesse, and fright thee from thy chaire.

                     First from my body shall he fright my soule,
                     And push me into dust. Isaack make hast

                     And hugge that chance, that opens thee the way
                     To ruinate Achmetes: did he stand
                     
                        
On termes of conscience, neighbor-hood or loue,
                     When he cashierd my daughter from his house,
                     And to the worlds broad eye, opened her crime?
                     No: he was swift and bitter in his hate,
                     And so will I, he is but now return'd
                     In Triumph from the field, as full of pride
                     As I of envy, hence Ile ground my hate.

                     They fought, Achmetes conquered at his foote,
                     Fell the proud rebell, wounded, but not slaine,
                     There might Achmetes with a blow of death
                     Cut off our feares, continued in his breath:
                     This shall incense the angry Emperor,
                     And crush Achmetes in his fairest hopes.
                     True polititians worke by others hands,
                     So I will by the Prince, my plot stands firme:

                     My tongue, to kindle hate in Baiazet,

                     Fame is of late growne dumbe of his renowne,
                     Surely vnwelcome newes clogs her swift wings,
                     Else had she now bin freqvent in our Court;
                     And we had fully knowne the chance of all.

                     We had, yet could not the event,
                     Lie so conceal'd, but Isaac found it out,
                     Which when I first discovered, straight it wrought
                     Tempests of passions in me, joy and griefe
                     Raign'd at one instant in the selfe same breast.

                     As thus. I joy'd that Zemes fell,
                     Was sorry he escap'd.

                     Isa.
                     Beneath Achmetes feete the traytor fell.

                     Isa.
                     Thus it might be, and was so: when sad death
                     Was glutted with the ruine of each side,
                     When slaughtring Mars had stain'd the field with blood,
                     And cast a purple colour o'r the earth,
                     
                        
At length some milder providence desir'd,
                     An end of those hot tumults that were seene,
                     To last in Zemes breath; so that their fire
                     Would be extinct, when Zemes should expire
                     Then from the middle skirmish forth were brought
                     He and Achmetes, being met they fought,
                     
                        Zemes was vanquish't by a violent blow,
                     Which strucke him trembling lower then his knees▪
                     
                     Now whither flattering, or present gifts
                     Redeem'd him from his fate I cannot show
                     Something they plotted, what, none yet can know.
                  
                  
                     Baia.
                     Canst thou advise me Isaack how to sound
                     The depth of all his mischiefe.

                     Dim'd her pale cheekes, with their transparent steele,
                     And added lustre to the dull sight morne,
                     So stood we in full pride till the bright Sunne

                     Is a prone torrent not to be withstood.

                     Fled with mine honour? and the common rest
                     Of man, growne stranger to me in my griefe?
                     Some vnknowne cause hath bred through all my bloud
                     A colder operation, then the juice
                     Of Hemlock can produce: O wretched man:

                     Of cheerefull health, or else infectious death.
                     If there an Angell be whom I haue crost
                     In my tormented boldnesse? and these griefes
                     Are expiatory punishments of sinne?
                     Now, now repentance strike quite through my heart,

I neither heare, nor see, nor feele, nor touch
                     With pleasure; my vexation is so much.
                     My graue can onely quit me of annoy;
