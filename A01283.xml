            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               TO THE MOSTE NOBLE VICTORIOVS AND redoubted prynce, HENRY the. VIII. by the grace of God, kynge of Englande, and of Fraunce, defendour of the faythe, Lorde of Irelande, and in erthe Supreme heed immediatly vnder CHRISTE, of the churche of Englande, Richarde Morysine his most humble and faithfull seruant, wyssheth all welthe, all honour, and triumphaunt victorie ouer all his ennemyes.
            
               
                  MOSTE HYGE excellente, and myghtye Prynce, mooste dere and dradde souerayne lorde, if the loue, whyche your hyghnesse beareth vnto this your noble empyre, stylle enforceth your graces harte, not onely to bestowe the better parte of all dayes, but of all nyghtes alsoo, in deuysynge in tyme of peace mooste godly lawes, statutes, and proclamations, for the tranquillitie and quietnesse of your subiectes sowles, in

tyme of warre, plattes, blocke howses, bulwarkes, walles, castelles, with other munitious, ingins, and fortresses, for the safetie and surenes of their bodies: if no so wernesse of peyne canne amoue your gracis thoughtes from contynuall trauayle, Can I without my great shame, not be styred to worke somewhat for my parte? He hath lyttell wylle to trauayle, lyttell loue to his countrey, that seeth before his eies, your hyghnesse thus occupied: and yet is nothynge pricked, to do that he thinketh may serue his countrey. Wyse writers feyne, that fond loue hath wynges, and seldome abydeth longe in a place, beynge hyther and thyther ledde by folye, and phansy: I can nat but also thynke, that discrete loue hath his wynges, and flyeth fast, where he seeth good may be done. Loue hath no leaden heles, and as he is quicke, so is al labour light, where loue hyreth the workeman. The fethers of his wynges are so softe, that if they lye betwene our shulders, and the burdeyn, the weight is lytel felt, though we beare neuer so heuy. Loue easily entertayneth

all powers of the harte, and withoute force compelleth theym all, to doo that, that duetie maye by any title chalenge of them. Your hyghnes welle declareth, that where occasion is, Loue can not be ydell. Lorde, howe may al englyshemen reioyce, that your grace neyther spareth, to vysite with your owne eyes, ye ruinous places of the see quostes, by whiche our enemies myght sodeynly inuade vs, neyther yet letteth, to worke with your own handes, continually manegynge tooles, continually inuentyng newe sortes of weapons, newe kindes of shyppes, of gunnes, of armure. As god helpe me, I can not see, whyche waye to wysshe greatter pleasure, greatter comforte, to all englyshe men, than that they all myght se, howe your grace spendeth all the hole day. I haue sene it, and nowe nothyng wonder, though traytours, ennemies to your hyghnes, haue bene atte their departure, compellyd to say so moche honour by your grace, as they haue sayde. I see, albeit Malyce maketh men in their lyfe tyme, to swarue, to saye and

doo moche otherwyse, than Trouthe is, that yet, the presence of deathe, feare of god, &amp; force of conscience, dryueth them to confesse trouthe, whan lyes wyll serue no longer, whan vyces appere to be as they are. Coulde syr Nycolas Carowe, haue fallen into treason, yf he hadde thought well vpon that in his lyfe tyme, whyche he confessed to be trewe, at his deathe? But I muste by youre gracis fauour, leaue of that, whyche I am fallen into by the way, and intreate of that, whiche I purposed to speake of. I haue longe sythens, bene moche desyrous, to dedicate some thynge of myne to youre hyghnesse, but fyndynge all my tryfles, farre to base, to meane, to humyle, to go abrode, vnder the name of soo noble and hygh a prince, I haue rather doone that becommed me, than folowed that I most desyred. but nowe, not withstandynge, that this my labour is full lyke the reste, rude, vnperfecte, and rather begun than fynyshed: yet perceyuynge youre grace, euen to thyrste the safetie of your people, the defence of this youre moosle noble

royalme, I coulde not, but for a season, a courtayne drawen betweene my weake eies, and the resplendent beames of your most clere maiestie, folow feruent desire, and humblye offer vnto your hyghnesse, this my rude translation, not doubtynge but as noble Xerxes thankfully receyued an handfull of water, of a poore manne, that so youre princely goodnesse, wolle take in good parte, this myne, what soo euer be, borne, and brought vp vndoubtedly, in good wylles howse.
            It hath ben somtyme moued, whether in warre, Polycy of mynde, or Strength of body, shulde do more. but longe experience, hath put this thyng so out of question, that in all battayles, the specialle prayse or disprayse remayneth to the Capitayne. Yea some men are not affrayde to affirme, that it is moche better to haue an armie, where the Capitayn is a lyon, and all the hoste fearefull dere, than to haue a dere the capitayne, and al the host lyons. Aiax was stronge, Ulysses wise: Homere gyueth moche more praise to the laste, than to the fyrste. Aiax was hardye

and valyant in fyght: but Ulisses knew the time &amp; place, where hardinesse might preuayle. Strength stryketh, but Policie prouydeth, that the stronge be not ouermatched, and that they bestowe strokes in a ryghte place, and at tyme conuenient. Many mo fieldes haue ben lost for lacke of polycie, than for wante of strength. many townes wonne by sleightes, whyche a longe season easilye were kepte ageynst greattest myght, strength, and force. Wherfore seinge present occasion requireth martiall feates to be knowen, and strength of bodye to be armed and anymated with wytte and polycie: I entendynge here to serue my countreye, founde nothynge so fytte, for thaccomplyshement of this my purpose, as to set out the Strategemes, sleightes, &amp; craftes, vsed by the noblest capytaynes, that all antyke hystories treate of. By redyng and reasonynge wherof, your gracis capitaynes shall not only increase and noryshe their imagination, inuention, and derteritie, in vsynge lyke sleightes, but easily escape al trappes, gynnes, and imbushementes,

layde for them. They shal also hereby perceyue, many swete baytes to couer sowre hokes. They shall lerne there to escape danger, where gret aduā
               tage is offred. The noble capitaynes of England, haue oft declared, that they lytell nede any instructions, any bokes, to teach them to towse their enemies: &amp; yet it can hurte no man, to see those thynges practysed, by auncient capitaynes, whiche may gyue good occasiōs, both warely to inuente newe polycies, and wysely to vse the olde. Noble hartes, vndoubtedly can not but desyre, to here of noble feates, and take pleasure in seinge, howe wytte with smalle force, ofte tymes worketh wonders, where excedynge greatte strength can nat auayle. If men be not wery, to playe a thousande tymes at one game, where eyther Fonde pleasure, or Uile gayne, or (whan it is best) helthe of body is sought: can any gentyll man be lothesome, to refreshe his mynde, to help his memorie, to kendle his courage with honeste delyte, of redynge or herynge suche thynges, as appertayne to thesafegarde

of body and goodes? to the purchasynge of honourable victories, fame, and renoume? The infirmitie of mans nature is suche, that bothe the senses of our body, and also the powers of oure mynde decay, and go to ruine, onles they be dayly refresshed and holpen. The eie is continually holpen, with clere lyghte, with freshe and comely colours, the smel with holsome ayre, and odours delectable, the taste asketh in his meates and drynkes, a dewe temperature. And as it is here, soo is it in the better parte of man, wytte, vnderstandynge, Memorie, and Inuention, with all the reste, qualities and ornamentes of the mynde, must be holpen with continuance of redynge, herynge, and reasonynge of mattiers, withoute whiche, they waxe rustye, they canker, and decaye. There is a tyme for al thinges, as Salomon wisely writeth. Whan tyme requyred peace, we talked lyttell of warre. Newe occasyons bryng matters, not thoughte vppon, in place. Tyme maketh euyl thynges not only cō
               parable with good, but good also. Whan

tyme is to pull downe, it is very folye to buylde. Whanne tyme byddeth slee, it is nothynge so good, to heale the diseased, as to kyll them that be not sycke. Whan tyme byddeth spende, sparynge is great waste. Loue is lewdenesse, whan tyme biddeth hate. Peace is to be refused, whā tyme forceth men to warre. Wherfore, I haue besydes this my trāslation, in an other tryfle of myn, exhorted al my contrey mē, peace laid aside, to prepare for warre, yt if nede constrein them to it, they may be redy to entertayne false frendes, worse thā enmies, accordyng to their desertes. I kepe your highnesse to longe with my rude talke, wherfore moste noble prynce, pardon craued, I wolle make an ende, moste humbly besechynge your maiestic, to accepte this cuppe of troubled water, a tyme maye comme, that good wyll, enstrengthned with your hyghnes fauour, may fynd some clerer veyne, and so serue your gracis thirst, with right delectable lyquour. Our lorde longe preserue your highnes, to the settyng forth of his glorie, to the cōfort of all your subiectes, to the destructiō, &amp; deth of al popery.
            Amē.

And thus they weried, and sore an hungred, after the. vi. houre, beganne to recule, whome Posthumius with his army freshe &amp; lusty, vāquished.
               Forasmoche as Iphicrates of Athens had knowledge, that his ennemies, continually vsed to eate at a certayne tyme, he commaunded his men to take theyr

repast more timely, and ranged them out in battayle, and settynge vpon his ennemies, he soo dalyed with theym, that he neyther wold gyue them batayle, nor yet suffer them to departe. nowe whanne it drewe towarde nyghte, he reculed backe agayne, kepynge his men neuer the lesse redy in theyr harneys: and whan his ennemyes beinge weryed, not onelye with standynge at theyr defence, but also with longe fastyng, made hast to refreshe their bodyes, and to take theyr repaste, Iphicrates againe brought forth his army, &amp; set vpon his ennemys being vnredy and out of order.

Scipto, ageynste this order and arraye, set the strengthe of his legion, ordred in thre batayles in the front, the speare men and the chiefe and strongeste souldiours: he ioyned not his cohortes to gether, but lefte a space betwene them, through whiche the elephantes dryuen by theyr ennemyes, myght easely passe without troublynge or breakinge the order of his battayles: those spaces betwene he fylled with souldiours in lyghte harneys, that the arraye shulde not be sene or shewe open: whiche had in commaundement, that at the violent commynge of the elephantes, they shulde eyther recule backe, orels go a syde. farther he ordeyned, that the horsemen shoulde be in the wynges: and ouer the Romayne horsemen in the ryght wynge he appoynted Lelius, and Masinissa ouer the Numidians in the

Than to inclose his ennemies he ordred his horsemen in two

wynges, of whome he had a great number. Agaynst these ordinaunces, Sylla lette caste a brode diche on eyther syde of his campe, the heedes of whiche he fortified with bastiedes or fortresses: to the intent he wolde not be inclosed of his enmies, and assayled on all sydes with the number of fote men, and namely of the horsemen, whiche were very stronge.

Farther he commaunded theym, that shuld defende the standerde, whiche were in the seconde battayle, to driue stakes in the grounde thycke together, bytwene the whiche, whan the waynes armed with sythes, approched, he receyued his armie. Than at laste makynge all a great shoute togyther, he commaunded the souldiours, that were lyght harneysed, to throwe their dartes, whiche done, the enemies waynes armed with sithes, eyther combred with the stakes, or feared

with the clamour and noyse, or greued with the dartes, tourned agayne vppon their owne host, and disturbed and brake the array of the Macedones: whiche reculynge backe, and Sylla pursuing, Archelaus sette to incountre hym, his hors men, the whiche the horsemen of the Romaynes put to flyght, and acheued the vyctorie.
               Whan that C.

duetie: whiche he caused to make many iourneys, and to beare on theyr backes, as moche vittayles as shulde serue them many dayes: so that he accustomed them to suffer colde and sharpe showres, and to wade ouer waters a fote. Nowe and than he imbrayded them of fearefulnesse and cowardise, breakynge such vesselles in pieces, whiche they vsed more of delycacie, than for nede in theyr expedition. In this behalf, the reproch, that he gaue to the capitaine C. Meuius, is right notable, to whome he sayde, To me but a whyle, to thy self and to the cōmon weale thou shalt euer be lewde &amp; vnprofytable.
               Q. Metellus in the warre Iugurthine with like seuerite restored the Discipline, that was decayed and neglected amonge the souldiours: and further prohybited them, that they shuld vse none other flesh but rosted or sodde.
               It is written, that Pirrhus shulde saye to hym that toke vppe souldiours, Chose thou those that be gret, and I wol make them stronge.

               Caius Marius, somewhat to ease the armie in carieng their traficke and baggage, wherwith they were greatly loded, deuysed their vessels and vittayles into fardels laide vpon staues, vnderset with forkes, whiche made their burthen lyghter, and they myght more easily rest vnder it. Whervpon they were called in pro uerbe, Marius mules.
               Whan Theogenes of Athens ledde his hoste towarde Megara, and was inquered

howe the army shuld be ordered, said, He wolde euen there order his battayles. Than priuily he sent forthe the horsmen, and commaunded theym lyke ennemies to retourne and fiersely sette vpon theyr felowes. Whiche thynge doone, he permytted the battayl to be thus ordred, that they that remayned with hym, as it were prepared to encoūter with their enmies, shulde take euery manne what place he wolde, and whā the faint harted felowes drewe backe, the stronge and valyaunt, boldly stepte forth into the forefront: and as he founde theym standynge, so he aduaunced them in the order of chiualry.
               ¶ Lysander of Lacedemonia corrected a certayne man, bycause he strayed from his company. And whan the man sayde, he strayed not from the army to robbe or steale any thynge, he answered, I wolle that thou shewe no spece or lykelyhod of robberye.
               Whan Antigonus hard, that his sonne had taken vp his lodgyng in a womans house that had three verye fayre doughters, he sayde: My sonne, I here say, ye

               ¶ All be it that N. Metellus cons. was let by no lawe, but that he mighte contynually haue his sonne in his companye, yet wolde he rather haue him wynne wages in warre.
               Whan Publius Rutilius cons. mighte accordynge to the lawe, haue his sonne always in his company, yet he made him a souldiour in the legion.
               T. Scaurus forbad his sonne to come in his syghte, bycause in the foreste Tridentine he gaue place to his enemies, the yonge man pressed with shame of that re proche and infamy, slewe hym selfe.
               The auncient Romaines and other nations dyd constitute and make theyr tentes and pauilions throughe the hole bodye of thyr army, lyke rounde cotages: where as the olde worlde knewe none other,

               Pirthus kynge of the Epirotes, was the firste, that ordeyned to lodge his hole armye within one trenche or bulwarke. After whan the Romaynes had ouercomen hym in the fieldes Arusine, nere the citie Statuentū, and had got his campe, markynge and obseruynge howe he ordered his armye, by lyttell and lyttel they came to this maner of pitchynge of tentes, and lodgynge their armye, that is nowe vsed.
               P. Nasica lying with his army in their wyntryng places, ordeined that his souldiours shulde falle to buyldyng of shippes, though the vse of them was to hym nat nedefull: leste they shulde be corrupted with slouthe and idelnes, orels by reson of leysure, hauynge nothynge to do, wolde imagyn and commytte some iniurie ageynst those that were confederates and frendes to the Romaynes.
               Clearchus, chieftayne of the Lacedemoniens, sayde to his armie, The capitayne ought rather to be dredde, than the ennemie: sygnifienge that they, whyche

feared the doubtefull darte of deathe in battayle, if they left their capitayn, were sure of extreme punyshement.
               By the counsayle of Appius Claudius the senatours decreed, that they whiche were taken by kyng Pirrhus, and after sent home ageine, if they were horsemen, shulde be made fote menne, if they were fote men, shulde be made lyghte harneysed men, &amp; all suche to lodge without the campe, tyll eche of theym, had broughte home two spoyles of theyr ennemyes.
               Otacilius Crassus cons. commanded, that they, whiche taken of Anniball, and crepynge vnder the yocke of reproche, were retourned home, shulde lye without the trenche of the campe, that they being vnfensed, myght accustome them selfes to perylles, and waxe the more bolde and hardy agaynste theyr ennemies.

Ptolomeus, being to weake to encoun tre with Perdicca, whiche had a stronger and more valiaunt army, caused a fewe horsmen to driue al the beastes, drawing the wagons after the host, and he going before them with that smalle power that he had, broughte to passe, that the duste reysed vppe by the beastes, mustred as thoughe an other army to ayde hym had folowed after.

               ¶ What tyme the barbarous aliens pro mised Cato men to conducte hym in his iourney, and also a garrison to ayd him, so that he wolde gyue them a great some of money, he stacke nat at the matter, to promyse them largely, bycause he might other paye them obtaynynge the victory with the spoyles of his ennemies, or by their deathe be lowsed of his promyse.

               Whan Phylyp hard, that one Pithias, a valyant warriour of his, had withdrawen his good wyl from him, bicause that he had scante to susteyne his. iii. doughters, and was nothynge relieued of the kynge, certayne men warned the kynge, to take hede and beware of hym.

The Perseans bycause they knewe the shyppes and the apparayle of them, whiche stode aboue the hatches, toke no hede to theym selfe, and so they beinge sodeynly oppressed, were in one selfe day, vanquished in battayle bothe by see and on the lande.
            
            The ende of the fourth boke.
         
         
            ¶Bycause the pages shulde not be vacant, we haue added these generalle rules of warre, taken out of Vegetius.
            
               IN all battayles of expedition this is a sure rule, That what so euer is profytable to the, is hurtefull to thyne aduersarie, and that, that helpeth hym, hyndreth the. Therfore after our ennemies

mynd and intent we shuld nothing do, or dissemble, but do that onely, whiche we iudge profytable for vs. For than thou begynnest to do agaynste thy selfe: whan thou folowest that that he wolde faynest thou dyddest. Ageyne, what soo euer thou enterprisest for thy profite, shal be agaynst hym, if he woll folowe it.
            He that in warre moste laboureth and exerciseth his souldiours in trauayles, that longe to the warres, shall alwayes susteyne leaste perylle and daungier.
            Neuer range out in the front of the battayle, a souldiour, of whome before thou haste had none open profe.
            It is better to vanquyshe thyn ennemy with neede, with sodeyne inuasyons, or with terror, thā with fyghtyng in playne battayle: in the whiche Fortune is wont to beare a greatter stroke than vertue.
            Those counsayles are beste, whyche thyne aduersarie knoweth nothynge of, tyll they be done in dede.
            Occasion or sodeyne happe in battayle helpeth more than vertue or strength.
            In solycitynge and receyuynge of ennemies,

whiche faithfully flee vnto the, is great truste: for the fleers from thyne ennemye to the, are to hym more harmefull, than they that thou sleest.
            It is better to kepe many stronge wardes behynde the forefront, than to sprede to wyde thy warriours.
            It is harde to ouercome hym, that can truly iudge his own strength, and what power his aduersarye hath.
            More auayleth vertue and strengthe than multitude.
            The well chosen place, dothe often tymes more auayle thā vertue or strength.
            Nature bringeth forth few strong men, but wel diuised ordinance maketh many.
            The armye with labour profiteth, with idelnesse, waxeth dull.
            Neuer brynge oute thy souldyours to fyght a battayl, except thou se them hope to haue the vyctorie.
            Sodayne dedes of warre affrayeth the enmies, the vsual featis ar not regardid.
            He that with his people disparpled, pur sueth his enemies vnwisely, may happe to gyue to his ennemie the vyctorie, that

he before had gotten.
            He that prepareth not before, wheate and vyttayle necessarie for his hooste, is vanquyshed without weapon.
            He that hath mo people, and is stronger than his ennemie, let hym make his forewarde foure square: whiche is the fyrsie maner of assaylinge.
            He that is febler than his foo, lette hym set his ryght wynge ageynst his enmyes lefte wyng, whiche is the seconde maner.
            He that feleth hym selfe strongest in the lyft wynge, let him assayle his ennemies ryght winge, which is the thyrde maner.
            He that hath in bothe wynges stronge souldiours, and well exercised, lette hym sette on bothe wynges at ones, whiche is the fourthe maner.
            He that can beste rule his lyght harneised, lette hym inuade eyther wynge of his ennemies, settynge the archers in the forefront, whiche is the fyfte maner.
            He that trusteth neyther in the number nor in the strength of his souldiors, and must nedes fyght, let him with his right wynge assayle his ennemies left wynge,

stretchynge out the reste of his army like a spyt or broche. whiche is the. vi. maner.
            He that hath fewer and weaker souldiours, lette hym so pytche his fielde, that he haue on his one syde a mountayne, a citie, a see, a ryuer, or some other thynge, and this is the seuenth maner.
            He that trusteth in his horsmen, let him ordeyne his fielde in a playne, and let the burthen of the battayle reste mooste on the horsemenne.
            He that trusteth in his footemen, lette hym pytche his felde on a knap or highe grounde, and lette the burthen of the batayle reste most on the foote men.
            If thou suspect, that a spye of thyn ennemye lurketh in thyne hoste, command, that euery man be in his owne lodgynge by day light, &amp; anon the spy is perceiued.
            Whan thou wottest, that thy counsaylle is discouered to thyn enmies, than it behoueth the, to chaunge thy purpose.
            Treate thou with many, what oughte to be done, but what thou wylte doo, disclose that to fewe, that ar most faithfull, or els kepe it secrete to thy selfe.
            
               
Peyne and drede chastyseth souldiors whan they lye styl, in settynge forwarde, hope and mede maketh them better.
            Good capitayns neuer fyght in a pight fielde, excepte they be dryuen thereto by sodeyne happe or great nede.
            It is a gret wise policy, rather to greue thyn enmie with hūger, thā with wepon.
            Let not thyne enmie knowe, with what ordinaunce, in what maner wyse, or how thou intendest to assayl him, lest he p̄pare ordynance to withstand or distroy thyne.
