            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ¶TO THE RIGHT HOnourable,
Edward de Vere Earle of Oxenford, Vicount
Bulbecke, Lord of Escales and Badlesmere, and Lord
great Chamberlaine of England. Robert
Greene vvisheth long life vvith increase
of honour.
            
               THat poore Castiliā Frontino (right honorable)
being a very vnskilful painter, presented
Alphōsus, the Prince of Aragō with a most
imperfect picture, which the king thankfully
accepted, not that he liked the work, but
that he loued the art. The paltering Poet
Cherillus dedicated his duncing Poems to that mightie
Monarch Alexander, saying that he knew assuredly if Alexander
would not accept them in that they were not pithie,
yet he would not vtterly reiect them, in that they had
a shew of Poetrie. Caesar oft times praised his souldiers
for their will, although they wanted skill: and Cicero as
well commended stammering Lentulus for his painfull industrie,
as learned Laelius for his passing eloquence. Which
considered (although wisdome did will mee not to straine
further then my sleeue would stretch) I thought good to
presēt this imperfect Pamphlet to your honors protectiō,
hoping your Lordship will deigne to accept the matter in
that it seemeth to be prose, though some thing vnsauory
for want of skill, and take my wel meaning for an excuse
of my boldnesse, in that my poore wil is not in the wane,
whatsoeuer this imperfect worke doo want. The Emperour
Traian was neuer without sutors, because so courteously
he would heare euerie complaint. The Lapidaries

continually frequented the Court of Adobrandinus, because
it was his chiefe studie to search out the nature of
stones. All that courted to Atlanta were hunters, and
none sued to Sapho but Poets. Wheresoeuer Maecanas
lodgeth, thether no doubt will schollers flocke. And your
honour being a worthie fauourer and fosterer of learning,
hath forced many through your exquisite vertue, to offer
the first fruits of their studie at the shrine of your Lordships
curtesie. But though they haue waded farre &amp; found
mines, and I gadded abroad to get nothing but Mites, yet
this I assure my selfe, that they neuer presented vnto your
Honour their treasure with a more willing minde, then I
doo this simple trash, which I hope your Lordship
will so accept. Resting therefore vpon your
honours wonted clemencie, I commit
your Lordship to the Almightie.
            
               Your Lordships most dutifully to commaund, Robert Greene.
            
         
         
            
            To the Gentlemen
Readers, health.
            
               PAN blowing on his Oten pipe a little
homely Musick, and hearing no man dispraised
his small cunning, began both to
plaie so loude, and so long, that they were
more wery in hearing his musick, then he
in shewing his skill, till at last to claw him
and excuse themselues, they said his pipe was out of tune.
So Gentlemen, because I haue before time rashly recht aboue
my pitch, &amp; yet your curtesie such as no man haue
accused me, I haue once againe aduentured vpon your patience
(but I doubt so farre) as to be rid of my follie, you
will at the least saie as Augustus said to the Grecian, that
gaue him oft times many rude vearses: Thou hadst neede
(quoth he) reward me wel, for I take more paines to read
thy workes, then thou to write them. But yet willing to
abide this quip, because I may counteruaile it with
your former curtesie, I put my selfe to
your patience, and commit you
to the Almightie.
Farewell.

               ❧ THE CARD OF
Fancie.
            
               THere dwelled in the Citie of Metelyne a
certaine Duke called Clerophontes, who
through his prowesse in al martiall exploits
waxed so proud &amp; tyrannous, vsing
such mercilesse crueltie to his forraine enimies,
and such modelesse rigour to his natiue
Citizens, that it was doubtfull whether he was
more feared of his foes for his crueltie, or hated of his
friends for his tyrannie: yet as the worst wéede springeth
vp more brauely then the wholesomest hearbe, and
as the crookedst trée is commonly laden with most fruit,
so this rigorous Duke was so fauoured and fostered vp
by fortune, his estate béeing so established with honour,
and so beautified with wealth, so deckt with the diadem
of dignitie, and endued with fortunate prosperitie, hauing
in warres such happie successe against his foes, &amp; in
peace such dutifull reuerence of his friendes, (although
more for feare then fauor) as he seemed to want nothing
that eyther fortune or the fates could allowe him, if one
onely sore which bred his sorrowe coulde haue bene salued.
But this griefe so galled his conscience, and this
cursed care so combred his mind, that his happinesse was
greatly surcharged with heauinesse, to sée the cause of his
care could by no meanes be cured. For this Clerophontes
was indued with two children, the one a Daughter
named Lewsippa, and the other a sonne called Gwydonius,
               
this Lewcippa was so perfect in the complection of
her bodie, and so pure in the constitution of her minde,
so adorned with outwarde beautie, and endued with inward
bountie, so pollished with rare vertues and exquisite
qualities, as she séemed a séemely Venus for her beutie,
and a second Vesta for her virginitie; yea, Nature
and the Gods had so bountifullye bestowed their giftes
vpon her, as Fame her selfe was doubtfull whether shée
should make greater report of her excellent vertue, or exquisite
beautie. But his sonne Guydonius was so contrarie
to his sister Lewsippa, (though not in the state of
his bodie, yet in the stay of his minde) as it made all men
meruaile how two such contrarie stems could spring out
of the selfe same stocke: His personage indéede was so
comely, his feature so well framed, each lim so perfectlye
couched, his face so faire, and his countenance so amiable,
as he séemed a heauenly creature in a mortall carcasse.
But his minde was so blemished with detestable qualyties,
and so spotted with the staine of voluptuousnesse,
that he was not so much to be commended for the proportion
of his bodie, as to bée condempned for the imperfection
of his minde. He was so endued with vanitie, and so
imbrued wt vice, so nursed vp in wantonnesse, &amp; so nusled
vp in wilfulnesse, so carelesse to obserue his Fathers
commaund, and so retchlesse to regard his counsell, that
neither the dreade of Gods wrath, nor the feare of his fathers
displeasure, could driue him to desist from his detestable
kinde of liuing. Nay, there was no fact so filthy,
which he would not commit, no mischiefe so monstrous,
which he wold not enterprise: no daunger so desperate,
which he would not aduenture: no perill so fearefull,
which he would not performe: nor no action so diuellish,
which he would not execute. So immodest in his manners,
so rude in his iestures, yea, and so prodigall in his
expences, as mines of golde were not able to maintaine

such witlesse prodigalitie. This loathsome lyfe of Cwydonius
was such a cutting corasiue to his Fathers carefull
conscience, and such a haplesse clogge to his heauie
heart, that no ioye could make him inioye anie ioye, no
myrth could make him merrie, no prosperitie could make
him pleasant, but abandoning all delyght, and auoyding
all companie, he spent his dolefull daies in dumpes and
dolors, which he vttered in these wordes.
            NOw (quoth he) I proue by experience, the saying of
Soph
                     •
                  cles to be true, that the man which hath many
children shall neuer liue without some myrth, nor dye
without some sorrowe: for if they be vertuous, he shall
haue cause whereof to reioyce, if vicious, wherefore to be
sad, which saying I trie performed in my selfe, for as I
haue one childe which delights me with her vertue, so I
haue another that despights me with his vanitie, as the
one by dutie brings me ioye, so the other by disobedience
bréeds my annoy: yea, as ye one is a comfort to my mind,
so the other is a fretting corasiue to my heart: for what
griefe is there more griping, what paine more pinching,
what crosse more combersome, what plague more pernitious,
yea, what trouble can torment me worse, then to
sée my sonne, mine heire, the inheritour of my Dukdome,
which should be the piller of my parentage, to consume
his time in roysting and ryot, in spending and spoiling,
in swearing and swashing, and in following wilfullye
the furie of his owne frantike fancie. Alasse, most miserable
&amp; lamentable case, would to God the destinyes had
decréed his death in ye swadling clouts, or y• the fates had
prescribed his end in his infācy. Oh y• the date of his birth
had ben the day of his burial, or y• by some sinister storme
of fortune he had ben stifled on his mothers knées, so that
his vntimely death might haue preuēted my ensuing sorowes,
and his future calamities: for I sée that y• young
frie will alwayes proue olde frogges, y• the crooked twig

will proue a crabbed trée, that the sower bud will neuer
be swéete blossome, how that which is bredde by the bone
wil not easily out of the flesh, that he which is carelesse in
youth, will be lesse carefull in age, that where in prime
of yeares vice raigneth, there in ripe age vanitie remaineth.
Why Clerophontes, if thou séest the sore, why doest
thou not applie the salue, and if thou dost perceiue the
mischiefe, why doest not preuent it with medicine, take
away the cause and the effect faileth, if Gwydones be
the cause of thy ruth, cut him off betimes, least hée
bring thée to ruine, better hadst thou want a sonne then
neuer want sorow. Perhaps thou wilt suffer him so long
till he fall sicke of the Father, and then he will not onely
séeke thy lands and liuing, but life and all, if thou preuent
not his purpose: yea, and after thy death he will be
through his lasciuious lyfe the ouerthrowe of thy house,
the consumer of thy Dukedome, the wracke of thy common
weale, and the verie man that shall bring the state
of Metelyne to mischiefe and miserie. Sith then thy sonne
is such a sinke of sorrowes, in whose life lies hid a loathsome
masse of wretched mishaps, cut him off as a gracelesse
graft, vnworthie to growe out of such a stocke. Alasse
Clerophontes, shalt thou bee so vnnaturall as to
séeke the spoile of thine owne childe, wilt thou bée more
sauage then the brute beasts in committing such crueltie,
no, alasse the least misfortune of our children doth so
moue vs, that as the Spider féeleth if her web be prickt
but with the point of a pin, so if they be toucht but with
the least trouble, we féele the paines thereof with prickking
griefe to pinch vs. Why hath not nature then caused
loue to ascend as wel as to descend, and placed as dutifull
obedience in ye child, as louing affection in ye father:
&amp; with that he fetcht such a déep sigh, y• it was a signe of ye
extreame sorrow he conceiued for his sons witlesse folly.
But as he was readie againe to enter into his doleful

discourse, to aggrauate his griefe the more, and increas
                  •
               
his care, certaine complaints were brought him by sundrie
Citizens, of the outragious behauiour of his sonne
Gwydonius, which being attentiuely heard, he in great
cholar called for his sonne, against whom he thundered
out such threatning reproches, laying before his face the
miserie that would insue of such recklesse mischiefes, &amp;
promising that if he directed not his course by a newe
compasse, and leuelled his life by a new line, he woulde
not onely repay his folly with the penaltie of the lawe,
but also by consent of his Commons, disinherite him of
his Dukedome: that Gwydonius greatly incensed with
the seuere censure of his Father, broyling with furious
rage, sturdely burst foorth into these stubborne tearmes.
            SIr, (quoth he) if Terence his Menedemus were aliue,
and heard these your fond and fantasticall resons,
he would as readely condemne you of crabbednes,
as he accused Chremes of currishnesse: for as he by too
much austeritie procured his sonnes mishappe, so you by
too much seueritie séeke to bréed my misfortune. You old
men most iniustly, or rather iniuriously, measure our
stailesse moode by your stayed mindes, our young yeres
by your horie haires, our flourishing youth by your withered
age, thinking to direct our dooings by your doatings,
our wills by your wits, our youthfull fancies by
your aged affections, and to quench our fierie flames by
your dead coales and cinders: yea, supposing that the
Leueret shuld be as skilfull in making of a head as the
olde Hare, that the young Cubs shoulde as soone tapish,
as ye old Fox, that y• young Frie shuld as wel auoid the
net as the olde Fish, and that the young wantons shuld
be as warie as the old wysards. But this sir, is to make
fire frost, to chaunge heate to colde, mirth to mourning,
singing to sadnesse, pleasure to paine, and to tye the Ape

and the Beare in one tedder, sith then young stemme
                  •
               
will not be set on a withered stocke, that the young
twigge liketh not vnder the old trée, that the toyish conceipts
of youth are vnfit for the testie cogitations of age:
I meane for your satisfaction and my solace, to departe
from the Court, and to spend my dayes in trauell.
            
               Clerophontes no sooner heard this determination of
his sonne Gwydonius, but his sorrow was halfe salued,
and his care almost cured, thinking that by trauell hée
should either ende his life or amend his lewdnesse, and
therefore both hearted and hastened his sonne in this his
newe course, least delay might bréede daunger, or time
by some toye cause him tourne his tippet, furnishing &amp;
finishing all things necessarie for his sonnes iourney,
who readie to goe (more willing to trauell, than his father
to intreate him) had this friendly farewell giuen
him by Clerophontes.
            
            SOnne (quoth he) there is no greater doubt which dooeth
more déepely distresse the minde of a young man,
then to determine with himselfe what course of life is
best to take, for there is such a confused Chaos of contrarie
conceipts in young wits, that whiles they looke for
that they cannot like, they are lost in such an endles Laberinth,
as neither choice nor chance can draw thē out to
their wished desires, for so manie vaines so many vanities:
if vertue draweth one way, vice driueth another
way: as profit perswades thē, so plesure prouokes them:
as wit weigheth, will wresteth: if friends counsell them
to take this, fancie forceth them to choose that: so that desire
so long hangs in doubt, as either they choose none, or
els chaunce on the worst. But in my opinion, the fittest
kind of life for a young Gentleman to take (who as yet
hath not subdued the youthfull conceipts of fancie, nor
made a conquest of his will by witte) is to spende his

time in trauell, wherein he shall finde both pleasure and
profite: yea, and buy
                  •
                that by experience, which otherwise
with all the treasure in the world hée cannot purchase.
For what chaungeth vanitie to vertue, staylesse
wit to stayed wisedome, fonde fantasies to firme affections,
but trauell: what represseth the rage of youth, and
redresseth the witlesse furie of wanton yeares, but trauell:
what tourneth a secure life to a carefull lyuing,
what maketh the foolish wise, yea, what increaseth wit
and augmenteth skill, but trauell: in so much that the
fame Vlysses wonne, was not by the tenne yeares hee
laye at Troy, but by the time he spent in trauell. But
there is nothing Gwydonius so precious which in some
respecte is not perillous, nor nothing so pleasaunt
which maye not be painefull: the finest golde hath hys
drosse, the purest wine his lées, the brauest rose his prickles,
each swéete hath his sower, each ioye his annoy,
each weale his woe, and euerie delyght his daunger.
So trauaile Gwydonius is a course of life verie pleasant,
and yet very perillous, wherin thou mayst practise
vertue if thou take héede, or purchase discredite if thou
béest carelesse: where thou maist reape renowne if thou
béest vertuous, and gaine reproch if thou be vicions:
whereout doo spring wisedome and folly, fréedome
and bondage, treasure and trash, fame and discredite,
honour &amp; shame, according to the dispotion of him which
eyther vseth it to his profit, or abuseth it to his discommoditie.
Sith then thou shalt beare sayle in such perillous
Strayghtes, take héede least thou dash thy ship
agaynst most daungerous Rockes. It is a saying Gwydonius,
not so common as true, that hée which will
heare the Syrens sing, must with Vlysses tye himselfe
to the mast of a ship, least happely he be drowned. Who
so meanes to be a sutor to Circes, must take a Preseruatiue,
vnlesse he will be inchaunted.
            
               
He that will fish for y• 
               Torpedo, must annoynt his hand
with the oyle of Nemiphar, least he be charmed, &amp; who
so meaneth to enter combat with vanitie, must first surely
defence himselfe with the target of vertue, vnlesse hée
meane to be a captiue to care, or calamitie. I speak this
Gwydonius by experience, which afterwarde thou shalt
know by proofe, for in trauell thou shalt finde such subtill
Syrens as will indaunger thée, such sorcering Cirees
as will inchaunt thée, such poysoned Torpedos, as will
not onely charme thy hand but thy heart, if by my experience
and other mens perils thou learn not to beware.
First Gwydonius, be not too sumptuous least thou seeme
prodigall, nor too couetous least they compt thée a niggard:
for by spending in excesse thou shalt be thought a
vainglorious foole, and by too much sparing a couetous
pesant. Be not wilfull in thy dooings that they count
thée not witlesse, nor too rash, that they think thée not deuoyd
of reason: be not too merrie that they count thée
not immodest, nor too sober least they call thée sullen, but
shew thy selfe to be an olde man for thy grauitie, and a
young youth for thy actiuitie: so shal all men haue cause
to praise thée for thy manners, and commend thée for thy
modestie. Be not too curious Guydonius, that they déeme
thée not proud, nor too curteous, least they call thée counterfaite.
Be a friend to all, &amp; a foe to none, and yet trust
not without triall, nor commit any secret to a friendlye
stranger, least in too much trust lye treason, and thou be
forced by repentaunce to 
                  •
               rie Peccaui. The swéetest
Muske is sower to be tasted, the finest Pils most bitter
to be chewed, and the flattering friend most tickle being
tried, then beware least faire words make fooles faine,
&amp; glozing spéeches cause had I wist come too late. Lende
not Gwydonius a listning eare to the Alarums of loue,
nor yéeld not thy fréedome to the assault of lust, be not
dazeled with the beames of fading beautie, nor daunted

with the desire of euery delicat damsell, for in time such
blisse will proue but bane, and such delightfull ioye, but
despitefull annoye. Lust Gwydonius will prooue an enimie
to thy pursse, and a foe to thy person, a canker to
thy minde, and a corasiue to thy conscience, a weakner of
thy wit, a molester of thy minde, a besotter of thy sences,
and finally a mortall bane to all thy body, so that thou
shalt find pleasure the pathway to perdition, and lusting
Loue the load-stone to ruth and ruine. Séeke not then
Gwydonius gréedely to deuour that baite, where-vnder
thou knowest a hurtful hook to be hidden: frequent not y•
plesure which wil turn to thy poyson, nor couet not y• cō
               panie,
which will conuert to thy confusion, least through
such follye thou haue cause in time to bée sadde, and I
to be sorrowfull. Now Gwydonius that thou hast heard
the aduertisement of a louing father, follow my aduice
as a duetifull Childe, and the more to binde thée to perfourm
                  •
               
my former preceptes, that this my counsaile be
not drowned in obliuion, I giue thée this Ring of gold,
wherein is written this sentence, Praemonitus, Praemunitu
                     •
                  .
A Posie pretie for the wordes, and pithie for the
matter, shorte to bée rehearsed, and long to bée related,
inferring this sence, that he which is fore-warned by
friendlye counsayle of imminent daungers, is fore-armed
against all future mishappe and calamitie, so
that hée maye by fore-warning preuent perills if it be
possible, or if by sinister fortune he cannot eschew them,
yet hée maye beare the Crosse with more patience and
lesse griefe. Kéepe this Ring Gwydonius carefully, that
thou maist shew thy selfe to respect thy owne case▪ and
regarde my counsaile: and in so dooing thou shalt please
me, and pleasure thy selfe.
            
               CLerophontes hauing thus ended his discourse, embracing
his sonne with fatherlye affection, and giuing

him his blessing, went secretlye into his Chamber
the more to couer his griefe which hée conceyued for
his sonnes departure: vnwilling his sonne should perceyue
by his sorrowe how vnfainedly he both liked and
loued him.
            WEll, Gwydonius hauing taken his leaue of his father,
furnished both with counsell and coyne, with
aduice of wisedome and ayde of wealth, passed on his
iourney very solempnly, vntill he was past the bounds
of his fathers Dukedome, and then as merrie as might
be he trauayled by the space of seauen wéekes without
anye residence, vntill he came to a Citie called Barutta,
where (whether he were delighted with the scituation
of the place, or deluded with the perswasion of some
Parasiticall persons) he securelye setteled himselfe by
the space of a whole yeare: in which time hee 
                  〈◊〉
                carelesly
floated in the seas of voluptuousnesse, and so recklesselye
raunged in lycentious and lawlesse lybertie,
thinking himselfe a peasaunt if hée were not prodigall,
counting nothing comelye if not costlye, nothing
seemelye if not sumptuous, vsing such monstrous excesse
in all his actions, that the Citizens of Barutta
noted him for a myrrour if immoderate lyfe, and a verye
patterne of witlesse prodigalitie: yea, his excessiue
expences daylye so increased, that Mynes of golde had
not bene sufficient to mayntaine his pompous magnificence,
in so much that the Magistrates of Barutta, not
onelye meruayled where hée hadde coyne to counteruayle
his expences, but also beganne to suspecte him
eyther for some skilfull Alcumist, or that hée had some
large Commission to take vp those pursses that fell into
lapse, for want of sufficient defence: wherevppon
béeing called before the Magistrates and stricktlye examined

what Trade hée vsed, why hée stayed so long,
in the Citie, and howe hee was able to mayntayne so
Princelye a porte as hée carryed? Guydonius vnwillyng
to haue them priuye to his Parentage, beganne
to coyne a scuse, yet not so cunninglye but hée was
trapte in his owne talke, and so caste in Prisonne,
where hée laye clogged with care, and deuoyd of comforte,
hauing not so much as one trustye friende, amongest
all those trothlesse flatterers which in prosperitie
hadde so frequented his companye, the ingratitude of
whome, so perplexed his molested minde, as surcharged
with sorrowe, hée burst foorthe into these
tearmes.
            ALas (quoth hée) now haue I bought that by haplesse
experience, which if I hadde bene wyse, I
might haue gotte by happye counsayle: Nowe am I
taught that with payne and perill, which if selfe-loue
hadde not besotted my sences, I myght haue
learned with profitte and pleasure: that in the fayrest
Sandes is most ficklenesse, out of the brauest
Blossome moste commonlye springeth the woorste
Fruite, that the finest Flower seldome hath the best
smell, that the moste glystering Stone hath oftentymes
the leaste vertue, and that in the greatest shew
of good wyll lyes ofte times the smallest effecte of
friendshippe, in moste flatterye leaste fayth, in the
fairest face the falsest hearte, in the smoothest Tale
the smallest Truth, and in the swéetest gloses moste
sower ingratitude: Yea, I sée nowe (quoth hée) that
in trust lyes treason, that fayre woordes make fooles
fayne, and that the state of these fayned friendes
are lyke to the Marygolde, which as longe as the
Sunne shyneth openeth her leaues, but with the least
                  •
               
               
Clowde beginneth to cloase, lyke the Uyolettes in America,
which in Summer yéelde an odoriferous smell,
and in Winter a most pestilent sauour: so these Parasites
in prosperitie professe most, but in aduersitie perfourme
least: when Fortune fauoureth they laugh,
when shee frowneth they lowre: at euerye full Sea
they flowrish, but at euerye deade Neape they fade:
Like to the Fish Palerna, which béeing perfectlye white
in the Calme, yet tourneth passing blacke at euerye
storme: to the Trées in the Desartes of Aff
                     •
                  ica, that
flourish but while the South winde bloweth, or to the
Celedony s
                  •
               one, which retaineth his vertue no longer
than it is rubbed with golde. Sith then Gwydonius,
(quoth hee) thou findes such falsehoode in friendshippe,
and such faythles deedes in such paynted speaches, shake
off these fawning curres with the flagge of deflaunce,
and from hencefoorth trye ere thou trust. I, but (quoth
hee) it is too late to applye the salue when the sore is incurable
to crye alarum when the Citie is ouer-runne,
to seeke for couerte when the storme is past, and to 
                  〈◊〉
               
héede of such flattering mates when alreadie thou art
deceyued by such fawning Marchauntes: nowe thou
wilte crye Caue when thy coyne is consumed, and beware
when thy wealth is wracked, when thou hast
nothing wherof to take charge, thou wilt be chary, and
when follye hath alreadie giuen thée a mate, thou wilt
by wisedome séeke to auoyde the checke, but nowe
thou tryest it true, that thy Father foretolde thée,
that so long thou wouldest bée carelesse, as at last Repentaunce
woulde pull thée by the sléeue, and then had
I wyst would come to late.
            Wel Gwydonius, sith that which is once past can neuer
be recald againe, if thou hast by follie made a fault, séeke
by wisdome to make amends, &amp; heap not care vpō care,
nor adde not griefe to sorrow, by these thy pittifull complaints,

but chéere vp thy selfe and take heart at grasse,
for the end of woe is the beginning of weale, &amp; after miserie
alwaies insueth most happie felicitie.
            
               Gwydonius hauing thus dolorously discoursed wyth
himselfe, remained not aboue ten dayes in prison, but
that the Senate taking pittie of his case, and séeing no
accusations were inferred against him, set him fr
                  •
               e from
his Purgatorie, and gaue him good counsaile that héereafter
he shoulde beware by such witlesse prodigalitie
to incurre such suspition. Theseus neuer triumphed
more after he had escaped the daunger of the perillous
laborinth, then poore Gwydonius did whē he was set free
from this pernitious Limbo, now the bitternesse of bondage
made his fréedome seeme farre more swéete, and his
daunger so happily escaped, caused his deliuerie seeme far
more delightfull. Yet he conceiued such discourtesie against
the Citizens, for repaying his liberall good will
with such loathsome ingratitude, that the next morning
he departed from Barutta, not stored with too much mony
for molesting his minde, nor ouercharged with coine for

                  •
               ombering his conscience with too much care, but hauing
remaining of all his treasure onely that ring wh
                  •
               ch his
father gaue him, trauailing verie solempnly toward Alexandria.
            
            Where at that time there raigned a certaine Duke
named Orlanio, who was so famous and fortunate, for
the peaceable gouernment of his Dukedome, administering
iustice with such sinceritie, and yet tempering the
extremitie of the lawe with such lenitie, as hée both gained
the good will of straungers in hearing his vertue, &amp;
wonne the heartes of his subiectes in féeling his bountie,
counting him vnworthye to beare the name of a Soueraigne,
which knewe not according to desert, both to
cherish and chastise his subiects.
            
               
Fortune and the fates willing to place him in the
pallace of earthly prosperitie, endued him with two
children, the one a sonne named Thersandro, &amp; the other
a Daughter called Castania, eyther of them so adorned
with the giftes of Nature, and beautified with good nurture,
as it was hard to knowe whether beautie or vertue
held the supremacie. But least by this happie estate
Orlanio should be too much puffed vp with prosperitie,
Fortune sparing him the mate, yet gaue him a slender
checke, to warne him from securitie, for before his daughter
came to the age of fourtéene yéeres, his wife dyed, leauing
him not more sorrowfull for the losse of her whom
he most entirely loued, then carefull for the well bringing
vp of her whome he so déerely lyked. Knowing that
as his Court was a Schoole of vertue to such as brideled
their mindes with discreation, so it was a nurse of vice
to those tender yéeres that measured theyr willes wyth
witlesse affection, estéeming lybertie as perillous to the
staie of youth, as precious to the state of age, and that nothing
so soone allured the minde of a younge maide to
vanitie, as to passe her youth without feare in securitie.
Feared with the consideration of these premisses, to auoyde
the inconueniences that might happen by suffering
Castania to leade her lyfe in lawlesse libertie, hée
thought it best to choose out some vertuous Ladie to
keepe her companie, who might directe her course by so
true a compasse, and leuell her lyfe by so right a lyne,
that although her young yeares were verie apt to bée
intangled in the snares of vanitie, yet by her counsell &amp;
companie, shée might steddelye tread her steppes in the
trace of vertue, and none hée coulde finde more fitte for
the purpose then a certaine olde Widdowe, called Madame
Melytta, honored for her vertuous life throughout
all Alexandria, who béeing sent for to the Court, he saluted

on this manner.
            MAdame Melytta (quoth hée) the reporte of thy honest
conditions, and the renowme of thy vertuous
qualyties are such, as thereby thou hast not onely purchased
greate praise, but wonne greate credite throughout
all the Countrie. Insomuch that I incensed by this
thy singular commendation, I haue selected thee as the
onely woman to whome I meane to commit my chiefest
treasure, I meane Melytta, my Daughter Castania,
to whome I wyll haue thée bée both a companion and a
counseller, hoping thou wilt take such care to traine her
vp in vertue, and trace her quite from vice, to winne
her minde to honestie, and weane her quite from vanitie,
that shée in her ripe yeares shall haue cause to
thanke thée for thy paines, and I occasion to regarde
thée as a friende, and rewarde thée for thy dilygence.
            FIrst Melytta, so that shée leade her lyfe both charylye
and chastly. Let her not haue her owne wyll,
least shée prooue too wilfull, nor too much lybertie, least
shee become too lyght. The Palme trée pressed downe,
groweth notwythstanding but too faste. The Hearbe
Spattania, though troden on, groweth verie tall, and
youth although stricktlye restrained wyll prooue but too
stubburne.
            The vessell sauoureth alwayes of that lycour
wherewith it was first seasoned, and the minde retayneth
those qualyties in age wherein it was trayned vp
in youth. The tender twigge is sooner broken then the
strong braunch, the young stemme more brittle then the
olde stocke, the weake Bramble shaken with euerye
Winde, and the wauering wyll of youth tossed

with euerie puffe of vanitie, readie to be wracked in the
waues of wantonnesse, vnlesse it be cunningly guided
by some wise and warie Pylot.
            Then Melytta, youth is so easily intrapped with the
alluring traine of foolish delights, and so soone intangled
with the trash of pernitious pleasures, suffer not my
daughter to passe her time in idlenesse, least happily being
taken at discouert, she become a carelesse captiue to
securitie (for whē the mind once floteth in ye surging seas
of idle conceits, then the puffes of voluptuous pleasures,
and the stiffeling stormes of vnbridled fancie, the raging
blasts of alluring beautie, and the sturdy gale of glozing
vanitie, so shake the ship of recklesse youth, that it is daily
in doubt to suffer most daungerous shipwracke. But
let her spend her time in reading such auncient authors
as may sharpen her wit by their pithie sayings, &amp; learne
her wisedome by their perfect sentences. For where nature
is vicious, by learning it is amended, and where it
is vertuous, by skill it is augmented. The stone of secret
vertue is of greater price if it be brauely polished,
th golde though neuer so pure of himselfe, hath the better
coulour if it be burnished, and the minde though neuer
so vertuous, is more noble if it be inriched with the gifts
of learning. And Melytta for recreation sake, let her vse
such honest sportes as may driue awaie dumps, least she
be too pensiue, &amp; frée her mind from foolish conceites, y• she
be not too wanton. Thus Madame as you haue heard my
fatherly aduise, so I praie you giue my daughter the like
friendly aduertisement, y• héereafter she may haue both
cause to reuerence thée, and I to reward thée.
            
               Melytta hauing heard with attentiue héede the mind
of Orlanio, conceiued such ioy in this new charge, &amp; such
delight in this happie chaunce, as with chéerefull countenance
she repaid him this aunswere.
            
               
SIr (quoth she) although in the largest Seas are the
sorest tempestes, in the broadest wayes most boysterous
windes, in the highest hilles, most daungerous
happes, and in the greatest charge the greatest care, yet
the duetie which I owe you as my Soueraigne, and the
loue I beare you as a subiect, the care I haue to please
you as my Prince, and to pleasure you as a Potentate,
the trust you repose in my truth without sufficient tryall,
y• confidence you put in my conscience without sure
proofe, the courtesie your grace dooth shewe mée without
anie desert, haue so inflamed the forepassed fire of duetifull
affection, and so incouraged mée to incounter your
graces courtesie, with willing constancie, that ther is no
happ
                  •
                so harde which I woulde not hazard, no daunger
so desperate which I woulde not aduenture, no burthen
so heauie which I woulde not beare, no perill so huge
which I would not passe, nor no charge so greate, which
both willingly and warily I would not performe. For,
since it hath pleased your grace to vouchsafe so much of
my simple calling, as to assigne me for a companion for
your Daughter Castania, I will take such care in the
charie performaunce of my charge, and indeauour with
such diligence both to couns
                  •
               ll and comfort Casta
                     ••
                  a, as
your grace shall perceiue my dutie in pleasing you, and
my diligence in pleasuring her.
            THE Duke hearing the friendly and faythfull protestation
of the good Ladie Melytta, tolde her that although
it were great trouble for one of her age to frame
her selfe as a companion to such young youth, and that
some care belonged to such a charge, yet hée woulde so
counteruaile her painefull labour with princely lyberalitie,
that both she and all Alexandria should haue cause
to speake of his bountie.
            
               
               MElytta thanking the Duke for such vndeserued curtesie,
setting her householde affaires in good order,
repaired to the Court as spéedely as might be. But leauing
her with Castania, againe to Cwydonius.
            
            Who now béeing aryued at Alexandria, pinched wyth
pouertie and distressed with want, hauing no coyne left
wherewith to counteruaile his expences, thought it his
best course, if it were possible, to compasse the Dukes
seruice, repairing therefore to the Court, he had not staied
there thrée dayes before hée found fit opportunitie to
offer his seruice to Orlanio, whome verie duetifully hée
saluted on this manner.
            TYE report (right worthie Prince) of your incomparable
courtesie and pearlesse magnanimitie, is so blazed
abroade throughout all Countries, by the golden
trumpe of Fame, that your grace is not more loued of
your subiects which tast of your liberall bounty, then honoured
of straungers, which onely heare of your princely
vertue. Insomuch that it hath forced me to leaue my
natiue soile, my parents, kindred, and familiar friendes,
and pilgrimelyke to passe into a straunge Countrie, to
trie that by experience héere, which I haue heard by report
at home. For it is not (right worthie sir) the state
of your Countrie which hath allured me (for I déeme Bohemia,
whereof I am, no lesse pleasant then Alexandria,
neither hath want of liuing) or hope of gaine intised me,
for I am by birth a Gentleman, and issued of such parents
as are able with sufficient patrimonie to maintaine
my estate, but the desire, not onely to sée, but also to
learne such rare curtesie and vertuous qualities as fame
hath reported to be put in practise in your Court, is the
onely occasion of this my iourney. Now if in recompence
of this my trauaile, it shall please your grace to vouchsafe
of my seruice, I shall thinke my selfe fully satisfied,

and my paines sufficiently requited.
            
               Orlanio hearing this dutifull discourse of Gwydonius,
marking his manners, and musing at his modestie,
noting both his excellent curtesie and exquisite beautie,
was so inflamed with friendlye affection towarde this
young youth, that not onely he accepted of his seruice,
but also preferred him as a companion to his sonne Thesandro,
promising that since he had left his Countrie and
parents for this cause, he would so counteruaile his dutifull
desert with fauour and friendshippe, as he shoulde
neuer haue cause to accuse him of ingratitude.
            
               Gwydonius repaying heartie thankes to the Duke
for his vndeserued curtesie, béeing nowe brought from
woe to weale, from despaire to hope, from bale to blisse,
from care to securitie, from want to wealth, yea, from
hellish miserie, to heauenly prosperitie, behaued himselfe
so wisely and warily, with such curtesie in conuersation,
and modestie in manners, that in short time hée not
hnely purchased credite and countenaunce wyth Orlanio,
but was most entirely liked &amp; loued of Thersādro.
            
            Now there remained in the Court a young knight, called
Signor Valericus, who by chaunce casting his glauncing
eies on the glittering beautie of Castania, was so
fettered in the snare of fancie, and so intangled with the
trap of affection, so perplexed in the Laborinth of pinching
loue, and so inchaunted with the charme of Venus
Sorcerie, that as the Elephant reioyceth greatly at the
sight of a rose, as y• bird Halciones delighteth to view ye
feathers of the Phoenix, and as nothing better contenteth
a Roe buck, then to gaze at a red cloth, so ther was no obiect
that could allure the wauering eies of Valericus, as
the surpassing beautie of Castania, yea, his onely blisse,
pleasure, ioy, and delight, was in féeding his fancie with
staring on the heauenlye face of his Goddesse. But
alasse her beautie bredde his bane, her lookes, his

losse, her sight his sorowe, her exquisite perfections, his
extreame passions, that as the Ape by séeing the Snaile,
is infected, as the Leoparde falleth in a traunce at the
sight of the Locust, as the Cockatrice dyeth with beholding
the Chrisolito, so poore Valericus was pinched to the
heart with viewing her comely countenaunce, was griped
with galding griefe, and tortured with insupportable
tormentes, by gasing vppon the gallant beautie of so
gorgeous a dame. Yea, he so framed in his fancie the
forme of her face, and so imprinted in his heart the perfection
of hir person, that the remembrance thereof would
suffer him take no rest, but he passed the daie in dolour,
the night in sorrow, no minute without mourning, no
houre without heauinesse, that falling into pensiue passions,
he began thus to parle with himselfe.
            Why how now Valericus (quoth hée) art thou haunted
with some hellish hagge, or possessed with some frantike
fury, art thou inchanted with some magical charme,
or charmed with some bewitching Sorcerie, that so sodainely
thy minde is perplexed with a thousand sundrie
passions, alate frée, and now fettered, alate swimming
in rest, and now sinking in care, erewhile in securitie, &amp;
now in captiuitie, yea, turned from mirth to mourning,
frō pleasure to paine, from delight to despight, hating thy
selfe, and louing her who is the chiefe cause of this thy calamitie
Ah Valericus, hast thou forgot the saying of Propertius,
that to loue howsoeuer it be, is to loose, and to fancie
howe charie so euer thy choice be, is to haue an ill
chaunce, for Loue though neuer so fickle, is but a Chaos
of care, and fancie, though neuer so fortunate, is but a
masse of miserie, for if thou inioye the beautie of Venus,
thou shalt finde it small vauntage, if thou gette one as
wise as Minerua, thou mayst put thy winninges
in thine eye, if as gorgeous as Iuno thy accompts being
cast, thy gaine shall be but losse: yea, be shée vertuous,

be 
                  •
               he cha
                  •
               t, be she courteous, be she constant, be she rich,
be she renowmed, be she honest, be she honourable, yet if
thou be wedded to a woman, thinke thou shalt finde in
her sufficient vanitie to counteruaile her vertue, that
thy happinesse will be matcht with heauinesse, thy quiet
with care, thy contentation with vexation: that thou
shalt sowe séede with sorrowe, and reape thy corne with
sadnesse, that thou shalt neuer liue without griefe, nor
dye without repentaunce, for in matching with a wife
ther is such mischifes, and in mariage such miseries, that
Craterus the Emperour wishing some sinister Fortune
to happen vpon one of his foes, prayed vnto the Gods,
that he might be maried in his youth, and dye without
issue in his age, counting mariage such a combersome
crosse, and a wife such a pleasant plague, that he thought
his foe could haue no worse torment, than to be troubled
with such noysome trash. Oh Valericus, if the consideration
of these premisses be not sufficient to perswade
thée: if the sentence of Propertius cannot quench
thy flame, nor the saying of Craterus coole thy fancie: call
to minde what miseries, what mischiefes, what woes,
what wailings, what mishappes, what murders, what
care, what calamities haue happened to such, as haue
bene besotted with the balefull beautie of women, enioying
more care than commoditie, more payne than profite,
more cost than comfort, more gréefe than good: yea,
reaping a tunne of drosse, for euery dramme of perfect
golde.
            What carelesse inconstancie ruled Eriphila? what
currish crueltie raigned in Philomela? how incestruous a
life lead Aeuropa? and how miserable was that man
that married Stheuolea? What gaines got Tereus in
winning Progne? but a loathsome death for a little delight.
Agamemnon in possessing the beautie of Crecida,
caused the Grecian armie most gréeuously to be plagued.

               Candaules was slaine by his murdering wife, whom so
intyrely hée loued. Who was thought more happy than
the husbande of Helena, and yet who in time lesse fortunate?
What haplesse chaunces insued of the chastitie
of Penelope? what broyles in Rome by the vertue
of Lucretia? the one caused her sutours most horriblye
to be slayne, and the other that Tarquin and all his posteritie
were rooted out of their Regall dignities. Phaedra
in louing killed her haples sonne Hippolitus, &amp; Clitemnestra
in hating slew her louing husband Agamemnon.
Alas Valericus, how dangerous is it then to deale
with such Dames? which if they loue, they procure
thy fatall care: and if they hate thée, thy finall calamitie.
            But ah blasphemous beast y• I am, thus recklesly to
raile &amp; rage without reason, thus currishly to exclayme
agaynst those without whome our life though neuer so
luckly, should séeme most loathsome, thus Tymon lyke,
to condempne those heauenlye creatures, whose onely
sight is a sufficient salue against all hellish sorrowes: is
this right, to conclude generallye of perticular premisses,
is it Iustice to accuse all for the offence of some, is it
equitie to blame the staye of vertuous women, for the
state of vicious wantons? Doost thou thinke Valericus
to shake off the shackles of fancie with this folly? or
to eschewe the baite of beautie, by breathing out such
blasphemie? No, no, assure thy selfe, that these thy raging
reasons, will in time be most rigorouslye reuenged,
that the Gods themselues will plague thée for braying
out such iniurious speaches. Alas, Loue wanting
desire, maketh the minde desperate: and fixed fancie
bereaued of hope, tourneth into furye. The loyall faith
I beare to Castania, and the loathsome feare of her ingratitude,
the déepe desire which inforceth my hope, and
the deadlye despayre which infringeth my happe, so tosseth

my minde with contrarie cogitations, that I neyther
regarde what I saye, to my harme, nor respecte
what I doo, to my owne hurte: yea, my sences are so be
               
                  •
               otted
with pinching Loue, and my minde so fretted
with frying fancie, that death were thrice more welcome,
than thus to linger in despayring hope.
            And with that, to passe awaye those pensiue passions,
hée floung out of his Chamber with his Hawke
on his fiste, thinking by suche sporte to dryue awaye
this melancholycke humour, which so molested
his minde.
            But as hée was passing thorough the Courte, hée
was luckelye incountered by Melitta and Castania, who
minding to haue some sporte with Valericus before hée
did passe: had the onset thus pleasauntly giuen him by
Castania.
            
            IT is harde Signor Valericus (quoth she) to take you
either without your Hawke on your fiste, or your
heart on your halfepenie, for if for recreation you be not
retriuing the Partridge with dogs, you are in solemne
meditation driuing away the time with dumpes, neyther
caring for companie to solace your sadnesse, nor plesantly
discoursing of some amorous Parle: which makes
the Gentlewomen of this Court thinke, that you are
either an Apostata to Loue, as was Narcyssus, or haue
displayed the flagge of defiaunce against Fancie, as did
Tyanaeus. If these their surmised coniectures be true
Valericus, I warne thée as a friend to beware by other
mens harmes, least if thou imitate their actions, thou be
mangled with the like miserie, or maymed with the like
misfortune.
            
               Valericus hearing his Saint pronouncing this sugred
harmonie, féeling himselfe somewhat toucht with
this quipping talke, was so rapte in admiration of

her eloquence, and so rauisht in the contemplation of hir
beautie, that he stoode in a maze not able to vtter on
                  •
               
word, vntil at last gathering his wits together, he burst
foorth into these speaches.
            MAdame (quoth he) what it pleaseth the Gentlewomen
of this Court to surmise of my solytarinesse I
knowe not, but if they attribute it too curiousnesse, or
coynesse to strangenesse, or statelinesse, either that I am
an enimie to loue, or a foe to fancie, that I detest theyr
bountie with Narcissus, or contempne their beautie with
Tiancus, they offer me great iniurie, so rashly to coniecture
of my disease, before rightly they haue cast my water.
But to put your Ladiship out of doubt what is the
cause of my dumpes, so it is that of late raunging the
fieldes, my heart (my hawke I shoulde say Madame) houered
at such a princely pray, and yet myst of her flight,
that since she hath neither prunde her selfe, nor I taken
anye pleasure. Marie if the fates should so fauour me, or
fortune so shrowde me vp in prosperitie, that my desire
might obtayne her wish, I would not onely change my
mourning to mirth, my dolour to delight, and my care
to securitie, but I would thinke to haue gotten as rich
a pray as euer Caesar gaind by conquest.
            SUrely Signor Valericus (quoth Melitta) no doubt the
pray is passing princely, since the valew thereof is rated
at so precious a price, and therefore we haue neither
cause to condempne your Hawke of haggardnesse, for
want of pruning, nor you of foolyshnesse for want of
pleasure. And if your heart (your hawke I should saye
Signor Valericus) hath reacht farther with her eye, than
she is able to mount with her wing, although I am no
skilfull Fawlconer, yet I thinke you had better kéepe
her on the fist still and so féede her with hope, then let her

misse agayne of her flyght, and so she tourne tayle and
bée foyled.
            In déede Madame (quoth Valericus) your counsaile
is very good, for as there is no better consect to a crazed
minde, than hope, so there is no greater corasiue to a
carefull man than despaire, and the Fawlchoners also
iumpe with you in the same verdite, that the Hawke
which misseth her praye, is doubtfull to soare aloofe and
prooue haggard. Yet if she were so tickle, as she would
take no stande, so ramage as she woulde be reclaymed
with no lure, I had rather happely hazarde her for the
gayning of so péerelesse a praye, though I both lost her
and wanted of my wish: than by kéeping her still in
the Bynes to prooue her a kyte, or me a coward.
            In déede Sir (quoth Castania), Fortune euer fauoreth
them that are valyant, and things the more hard,
the more haughtie, hie and heauenly: neyther is anye
thing harde to be accomplished, by him that hardelye
enterpriseth it. But yet take héede that you fishe not
so fayre, that at length you catche a Frogge, and then
repentaunce make you mumble vp a masse with Miserere.
            
            No Madame (quoth he) it is neuer séene that hée
which is contented with his chaunce, should euer haue
cause to repent him of his choyce.
            And yet (quoth she) hée that buyes a thing to déere
maye be content with his chaffer, and yet wish he had
bene more chaire.
            Truth Madame, (quoth Valericus) but then it is
trash and no treasure, for that which is precious is neuer
ouerprised, and a bad thing though neuer so cheape
is thought too chargeable.
            Oh Sir (quoth Melytta) and is it not an old saying,
that a man maye buye golde too deare, and that
Iewells, though neuer so precious maye bée set at too

high a price. I sée if you had no better skill in manning
of a Hawke, than in making of a bargaine, you would
prooue but an ill Fawlchoner. But since we haue so
long troubled you with our talk, we wil now leaue you
to your sport, and so bid you farewell.
            
               Valericus with a courteous Conge repaying theyr
courtesie, and with a glauncing eye giuing hys Goddesse
the dolefull A dio, went solytarily into the secret
woods, wher laying him downe in the shade, he fell into
these musing meditations.
            WHat greater prosperitie (quoth he) can happen vnto
any earthlye wight, than if he be crossed with
care, to finde a confect to cure his calamitie: then if hée
be pinched with paines, to get a playster for his passions:
if he be drenched in distresse, to finde a meanes to
mitigate his miserye, which I sée by proofe perfourmed
in my seelye selfe: for the sight of my Goddesse hath so
salued my fore-passed sorrowes, her sweete words
hath so healed my heauye woundes, that where before
I was plunged in perplexitie, I am nowe placed
in felicitie: where before I was oppressed with care, I
am now refreshed with comfort. O friendly Fortune,
if from hencefoorth thou furiouslye frowne vppon mée,
if thou daunt me with disaster mishappe, or crosse mée
with perpetuall care, yet this thy friendlye courtesie
shall bée sufficient to counteruayle all future enormityes.
            But alas, I sée euery prosperous puffe hath his boysterous
blaste, euerye swéete hath his sower, euerye
weale his woe, euerye gale of good lucke his storme of
sinister Fortune: yea, euerye commoditie his discommoditie
annexed: the bloud of the Uiper is most healthfull

for the sight, and most hurtfull for the stomacke, the
stone Celonites is very precious for the backe, and very
perillous to the braine: the flower of India pleasaunt to
be séene, but who so smelleth to it, féeleth present smart:
so as the ioye of her presence procureth my delight, the
annoye of her absence bréedeth my despight: yea, the

                  •
               eare that she will not repaye my loue with lyking, and
my fancie with affection, that she wil not consent to my
request, but rather meanes to stiffle me with the raging
stormes of repulse, and daunt me with the doome
of deadly denialles, so fretteth my haplesse minde with
hellish furie, that no plague, no paine, no torment, no
torture can worse molest me, than to be distressed with
this dreadfull despaire.
            Alas, her callyng is too high for me to clymbe vnto,
her royall state is farre aboue my reach, her haughtie
minde is too loftie for me to aspyre: no doubt if I offer
my sute vnto her she will prooue like the Stone of Silicia,
which the more it is beaten the harder it is: or like
the spices of Ionia, which the more they are pounded the
lesse sauour they yéelde, lyke to the Isiphilon, which yéeldeth
foorth no iuyce though neuer so well brused: so,
though I shoulde with neuer so great deuotion offer vp
at her Shrine, prayers, promises, sighes, sobbes, teares,
troth, faith, fréedome, yea, and my heart it selfe, as a
pledge to pleade for pitie, yet she would make so small
accompt of these my cares, and as lyttle regarde my
ruth and ruine, as Eriphila did her faithfull friend Infortunio.
            
            But oh vilde wretch that I am, why doo I thus with
out cause condempne Castania, why doo I accuse her of
crueltie, in whome raigneth nothing but courtesie? why
doo I appeach her of coynesse, in whome bountie sheweth
small curiousnesse?
            
               
How friēdly, how familiarly, yea how faithfully did she
talke with me, what a chéerefull countenaunce did shée
carrie towardes me, what sodaine glaunces, what louely
lookes, which no doubt are signes that though she repulse
me at the first, she will not refuse me at the last:
though she be straight in words, she wil not be strange
in minde: though she giue me some bitter pilles of deniall,
it shall be but for the better tryall. And shall I
then béeing fedde with this hope prooue such a meacocke
or a milkesoppe as to be feared with the tempestuous
Seas of aduersitye, when as at lenghth I shall arriue
at the Hauen of happie estate: shall I dread to haue
my shippe shaken with some angrie blastes, hoping to
bee safelye landed on the shoare, and so haue my share
of that, which the showers of shrewde Fortune for a
time hath denied me. No, no, Dulcia non meruit, qui
non gustauit amara. Hee is not worthye to sucke the
swéete, which hath not first sauoured the sower: hée
is not worthie to eate the kernell which hath not crackt
the shell, hee deserueth not to haue the crowne of victorye,
which hath not abidde the brunt of the Battaile:
he meriteth not to possesse the praye, whih will not willyngly
take some parte of the payne: Neyther is hée
worthye of so heauenlye a Dame as Castania, that
woulde not spende the most precious bloud in his bodye,
in the pursute of so péerelesse a péece.
            
               VAlericus thus mittigating his paine with the milde
medicine of hope, and rooting out the dead flesh of
despayre with the Playster of trust, determyned to
stryke on the Stythe whyle the yron was hotte, and
to pursue his purpose whyle his Mystresse was in
her good moode. And therefore leauing his sporte

for this time, hied him to the Court in hast: where insinuating
himselfe into the societie of the Ladies and gentlewomen,
hée shewed himselfe in sport so pleasaunt, in
talke so wittie, in manners so modest, in conceits so cunning,
in parle so pithie, &amp; in all his conuersation so comely,
that whereas before hée was specially loued of none,
now he was generally lyked of all: insomuch that for a
time there was no talke in the Court but of the Metamorphosis
of Valericus minde. Who often times determining
in plaine tearmes to present his sute to Castania,
when he came to the point, feare of offence and dreade of
deniall, disappointed his purpose, that he remained mute
in the matter: but at last perceiuing delaie bred daunger,
séeing his mistresse sit alone in his presence, houering
betwéene feare and hope, he began the assault with this
march.
            MAdame (quoth hée) for that I sée you sitting thus solitarie
in dumps▪ I am the bolder to prease in place,
although the most vnworthie man to supplie it. Hoping
you will pardon my rudenesse for troubling thus rashly
your musing meditations, and count my companie the
lesse offensiue in that I sée you busied with no such seryous
matters whervnto my presence may be greatly preiudiciall.
Cyneas the Philosopher, Madame, was of this
minde, that when the Gods made beautie, they skipt beyond
their skill, in that they framed it of greater force
then they themselues were able to resist, if then there is
none so wise or worthie whome beautie cannot wracke,
nor none issued of such princely birth, whom beutie cannot
bend, though I haue bene intangled with the snare
of fancie, and haue listened to the lure of beautie, I am
the more to be borne with, and the lesse to bée blamed.
For I must of force confesse Madame, that the giftes of
nature so abundauntly bestowed vpon you, your excellent

beutie and exquisite vertue, haue so scaled the wals
of my fancie, and sacked the fort of my fréedome, that for
my last refuge I am forced to appeale vnto your courtesie,
as the onely medicine which may cure my intollerable
disease. Nay incurable I may well call it, for (I
speake with teares outwardly, and droppes of bloud inwardly)
vnlesse the missing showers of your mercye
mittigate the fire of my fancie, the drops of your princely
fauour quench the flame of my affection, and the
guerdon of your good will giue a soueraigne Playster
for my secrete sore, I am lyke to passe my lyfe in more
miserie, then if I had taken the infernall tormentes.
But I hope it is not possible, that out of a Sugered
Fount shoulde distill a bitter streame, out of a fragraunt
flower a filthie sappe, and from such diuine
beautie shoulde proceede hate and hellish crueltie.
            It is Madame your beautie which hath wrought my
woe, &amp; it is your bountie which must worke my weale.
It is your heauenly face which hath depriued mée of
lybertie, and your curteous consent must bée the meanes
to redéeme mée from captiuitie: for as hée that eateth of
the Briane leafe, and is infected, can by no meanes bée
cured, vnlesse hée taste of the same roote: As hée which
is wounded of the Porcuntine, canne neuer bée healed
vnlesse his woundes bée washt with the bloude of the
same beast, as there is nothing better against the stingof
a Snake, then to bée rubbed with an Adders slough,
and as hée which is hurt of the Scorpion séeke a salue
from whome hée receiued the sore, so Loue onely is remedied
by Loue, and fancie by mutuall affection: You
madame must minister the medicine, which procured the
maladie, and it onely lies in your power to applie th
                  •
               
plaister which inferred the paine.
            Therefore I appeale to your good grace and fauour,
and at the barre of your beautie I humblie holde vp my

handes, resting to abide your sentence, either of consent
vnto life, or of deniall vnto death.
            
               CAstania hearing this solempne discourse of Valericus,
was driuen into a maze with this vnlookt for
motion, musing that he would so farre ouershoote himselfe,
as to attempt so vnlikelye a match, and therefore
with disdainefull countenaunce shée gaue gim this
daunt.
            AS your present ariuall Signor Valericus, dooth not
greatly preiudice my muses, so I thinke it will as little
profit your motion, and as your companie pleaseth
me regarding the person, so it much misliketh me, respecting
the parle: that your countes beeing once cast, you
shall finde your absence might haue more pleasured you,
and better contented mée. For it is vnpossible Valericus
to call the Fawlcon to that Lure wherin the pennes
of a Camelion are pricked, because shée dooth deadly detest
them, it is harde to traine the Lyon to that trappe
which sauoureth of Diagredium, because he loatheth it.
And it is as impossible to perswade mée to enter league
with fancie, which am a mortall foe to affection, and to
vowe my seruice to Venus, which am alreadie addicted
to Diana. No, no sir, I meane not to loue least I liue by
the losse, nor to choose, least my skill béeing small I repent
my chaunce. She that is frée and willinglye runneth
into fetters is a foole, and who so becommeth captiue
wtout constraint, may be thought either wilful or witles.
It is good by other mens harms to learne to beware, &amp; to
looke before a man doth leap, least in skipping beyond his
skill, he light in the myre. Who so considereth the ficklenesse
of mens affections, &amp; the fléeting fondnesse of their
fading fancie, who carefully looketh at the lyghtnesse of
their loue, and marketh the inconstancie of their wauering

minde, who readeth the recordes which make mention
of their déepe dissemblinges, faithlesse protestations,
false vowes, periured promises, fained loue, and forged
flatterie: how poore Ariadne was abused, howe Medea
was mocked, how Dido was deceiued, how Oenone was
reiected, and how Phillis was forsaken, and yet would be
allured to the traine with such filthie scraps, I woulde
count her chaunce too good, were her choice neuer so bad.
But leauing these necessarie doubtes, Valericus, I tell
you for troth, if I ment to loue, it is not you I meane to
lyke, if affection forced me, it is not your person I meane
to fancie, your patrimonie is not sufficent to counteruaile
my parentage, nor your bringing vp my birth, and
therefore I would wish you to sow the séede of your sute
in a more fertill soile, for in me you shall finde no grafts
of graunt to growe, nor no consent to be cropped, for I
neither lyke of your vnlikely loue, nor meane not to bée
framed to your fancie.
            
               Valericus béeing pushed with this Pike, thought it a
signe of small courage to yéelde at the first foine, &amp; therefore
looking more narrowly to his ward, and gathering
himselfe within his weapon, he stoode to his tackeling
with this replie.
            MAdame (quoth hée) if you condempne me of folly for
climing a staffe to high, or accuse me of fondnesse for
laying my loue on a person of such princely parentage, if
I séeme to make an ill market in cheaping such precious
chaffer, as the price thereof is farre aboue my reach, yet
my offence is too small to beare anie waightie penaunce,
sith where the fault procéedeth of loue, there the pardon
ensueth of course, but your beautie shall beare all the
blame, as the onely spurre of this my rash enterprise. For
as it is impossible for the yron to resist the operation of
the Adamant, or the sily strawe the vertue of the sucking

Ieat, so as impossible it is for a loner to withstande
the brunt of beautie, to fréeze if he stande by the flame, or
to peruert the lawes of Nature. So that madame if you
kn
                  •
               we what a breach your beautie hath made into my
breast, and howe déepelye I haue shrined the Idoll of
your person in my happelesse heart, I assure my selfe
though my person and parentage, my birth and bringing
vp be farre vnfitte for such a mate, yet you would déeme
my loue and loyaltie to deserue no lesse. Loialtie I call
it madame, for as all things are not made of one mould,
so all men are not of one minde, as the Serpentine po
                  •
               
               der
is quickly kindled, and quickly out, so the Salamander
stone once set on fire canne neuer be quenched, as the
soft Waxe is apt to receiue euerie impression, so the hard
mettall neuer chaungeth forme without melting. Iason
was neuer so trouthlesse as Troilus was trustie, Paris
was neuer more fickle then Pyramus was faythfull, Aeneas
was neuer so lyght as Leander was faythfull: And
sure Madame, I call the Gods to witnesse, I speake
without faining, that sith your beautie and vertue eyther
by fate or fortune is so déepely shrined in my heart,
if it please you to accept me for your slaue or seruaunt,
and admitte mee so farre into your fauour, as that I
may fréely inioy the sight of your sweete face, and féede
my fancie in the contemplation of your beautie, in liewe
thereof I will repaie such duetifull seruice, as the betrothed
fayth of Erasta to his Persida, shall not compare
with the loue of Valericus and Castania.
            
            
               CAstania hearing these perplexed passions procéede
from wofull Valericus, pricked forwarde to take
some remorse of his tormentes, felte within her minde
a carefull conflict betwéene fancie and the fates: loue and
the destinies, fancie perswaded her to take pittie of his
pai
                  •
               es, the fates forced her to giue him the repulse, Loue

wisht her to retourne his good will with gayne, the destinyes
draue her to denie his request, tossed thus with
contrarie cogitations, at last she burst forth into these
doubtfull spéeches.
            
               VAlericus, as I am not altogether to reward thy good
will with hate, so I cannot repaie it with loue, because
fancie denies me to like: to marie I meane not, to
retaine seruaunts I may not. Marie to let thée either to
loue, or looke, take this for an aunswere, I neither can
nor will.
            And with that shée went her waie, leauing Valericus
greatlye daunted with this doubtfull aunswere,
with feare and hope so fiercely assailed, that béeing lefte
alone, hée beganne thus to consider of his amorous
conceites.
            IF euer wofull creature had cause to complaine his
wofull case, then vndoubtedly maye I preace for
the formost place, for there is no sorrow more sower,
no torment more terrible, no griefe more grieuous, no
heauynesse more hurtfull, then to haue desire requited
with despight, and good wyll with hate, then to like vppon
hope of courtesie, and to finde nothing but hate and
hellish crueltie.
            Alasse poore Valericus, is thy true loue thus triflinglye
accounted off, is this the guerdon for thy good wyll?
Doeth thy déepe desire merite no better desert, then hast
thou no choice, but eyther to dye desperatelye, or else to
liue loathsomelye? Why fonde foole, doest thou count
her cruell, that at the first giues not a frée consent? Doest
thou thinke her coye that commeth not at the first
call, wouldest thou haue the match made at the first motion?
Shée that is wonne with a worde, wyll bée lost
with a Winde, the Hawke that bates at euerie cast of

the Lure, wyll neuer bée steadfast on the stonde, the woman
that frameth her wyll to euerie wishe, will prooue
but a wild wanton. No, no, Valericus, let not her denials
daunt thée, let not the sower tast of her talke quat thy
queasie stomacke, conster all thinges at the best, though
her censure was verie seuere, yet shée knitte vppe her
talke wyth a courteous close. The hound which at the
first default giueth ouer the chase, is called but a curre.
The Knight that finding the first encounter combersome,
giueth ouer the quest, is counted but a coward, and
the louer that at the first deniall is daunted with despaire,
is neyther worthie to obtaine his desire, nor inioy
his desert. And with that hée floung out of his Chamber,
both to auoyde the melancholy which tormented
his minde, and sée if hée coulde haue a sight of his
Goddesse.
            But Castania altogether vnwilling to parle wyth
her newe patient, kept her selfe out of his sight, which
Valericus espying, was no whit amazed, but lyke a valiaunt
Souldier gaue the fort a fresh assault with a new
kinde of batterie, séeking to obtaine that with writing,
which he could not gaine with words, and therefore speedely
framed a letter to this effect.
            
               
                  Signor Valericus to the
Ladie Castania, health.
                  THere is no creature (madame Castania) so bereaued of
reason, or depriued of sence, which béeing oppressed
with direfull calamities, findeth not by méere instinct of
nature, a present medicine for his maladie, man onelye
excepted, who by reason of this want, maye iustlye accuse
the iniurious Gods of iniustice. The Tyger though

                        
                           
                           neuer so deadly wounded tasteth the roote of Tamariske,
and is presently cured: The Deare béeing stroken
though neuer so déepe, féedeth on the hearbe Dictamum,
and forthwith is healed: the Lyon salueth his sicknesse
by eating the Sea woolfe, and▪ the Unicorne recouereth
his health by swallowing vp the buddes of a Date tree.
But man béeing crossed with care, or oppressed wyth
griefe, pinched with fancie, or perplexed with Loue, findeth
no Hearbe so wholesome, no medicine so milde, no
Playster so perfect, nor no Salue so soueraigne, which
by their secret vertues can appease his passions. Which
madame I knowe by proofe, and nowe speake by experience,
for your diuine beautie and secrete vertue, the
perfection of your bodie and the bountie of your minde,
hath kindled such a flaming fire in my haplesse heart,
that by no meanes it maye bée quenched, but will tourne
my bodie into dry earth and sinders, vnlesse by the drops
of your pittie it be spéedelye redressed. Then Madame
your beautie is my bale, let it bée my blisse, since it hath
wrought my woe, let it worke my weale, and let not
my faithfull seruice and loiall loue be recompenced with
such rigorous refusalls. Striue not for my lyfe, since you
haue my lybertie, séeke not my death, since you are the
Saint to whome I offer vp my deuotion. But good madame,
let the swéete Balme of your beneuolence salue
the sore which so painefully afflicteth my carefull conscience,
and with the deaw of your grace redéeme him from
most hellish miserie, whose lyfe and death standeth in
your aunswere, which I hope shall be such as belongeth
to the desert of my loue, and the shewe of your
beautie.
                           
                              Yours if he be Don Valericus.
                           
                        
                     
                     VAlericus hauing thus finished his letter, sent it with
as much spéede as might be by his Page to Castania,
who finding her at conuenient leasure, with most
reuerent dutie deliuered it. Castania at the first sight
coniecturing the contents with scorneful lookes and disdainfull
countenaunce vnripped the seales, where séeing
and reading his déep deuotion, she perceiued that his affection
was no lesse in déede, than hée professed in word,
she notwithstanding would take no remorce of his torment,
but to dryue him more into dolefull dumpes, she
retourned him this dampe.
                  
                     
                        Castania, to Signor
Valericus.
                        AS it is impossible (Signor Valericus) to strayne moyst
licour out of the drye flint, to procure flaming heat
in that which alreadie is nipped with chilling colde, to
force the sturdie streames to run against their common
course, so as harde it is to winne vnwilling loue, eyther
with teares, for trueth. For if thy birth and patrimonie
coulde counteruaile my parentage, if my Father
were content to knitte vp the knotte, yet neyther his
commaunde nor thy intreatie shoulde not make me to
choose without my owne loue or liking. Sith then thou
arte the man, whome I rather loath than like, cease
from thy sute, make a vertue of necessitie, and asswage
the flame thy selfe, which no other will quench.
By importunate persisting in thy purpose where no
hope is, thou proouest thy selfe rather a desperate sotte
than a discréete souldiour. To hoppe against the Hill,
is extreame fondnesse, to stryue agaynst the streame
méere follye, then Valericus auoyde the one and eschew
the other: for if thou wilt séeke to gaine my good wil,
                     
                  
                  
                     
thou shalte tourne the endlesse stone with Sisiphus, and
therefore take my naye for an answere. For if I wold
I can not, and if I coulde I will not. And so farewell.
                  
                     No waye yours, Castania.
                  
               
            
            VAlericus hauing receyued this rigorous Letter from
ruthlesse Castania, séeing with what great disdaine
she reiected his dutifull deuotion, and howe with coye
countenaunce and lowring lookes she rewarded his loyall
loue, hée beganne with reason somewhat to represse
his rage, and with wisedome to redresse his witlesse
follye, for comparing her crueltie with his owne courtesie,
and her wilfull disdaine with his willyng dutye,
his disordinate desire beganne not onely to decay,
but his extreame loue tourned to extreame hate, in so
much that forced with despight, hée sent her in reuenge
these raging lynes.
            
               
                  Valericus the despised, to despitefull
Castania.
                  DIogenes béeing demaunded why so extreamelye hée
hated women, aunswered, because (quoth he) they
be women: so if thou aske of me why so rudely I raile
agaynst thy recklesse folly, I aunswere, because thou
arte Castania, whose mercilesse minde is so misledde
with ingratitude, and whose currish nature is foyled
with carelesse inconstancie, that lyke Menechmus Supreptus
his wife, thou doost not begin to loue, ere agayne
thou séekest t
                        •
                      hate. Thou playest Castania lyke the
young Eagles, which béeing hatched vp by the Birde
Osyphaga, neuer séeke to pearke on loftye Mountes,
but to sitte in durtye Dales, and lyke the gréedie kyte
               
            
            
               
                  
                  which leaueth the swéete flesh, to praye on the stincking
carrion. But why doo I so farre forget my selfe?
Is shée to bée blamed that leaueth her choyce to haue a
better chaunce, or is the Fawlchon to bée accused of
bastardie, that leaueth the Starlyng to praye on the
Larke? No: and no doubt such is thy case, for if it
be true that all speaketh, or at the least suspecteth, thou
art lyke by thy louers Parentage to become a greate
Potentate: for if armes bée the bewrayer of auncient
discentes, no doubte hée is come of an olde house.
                  Yea, thy Father Orlanio maye reioyce if hée lyue to
sée the daye that his Daughter shall bée so well wedded
as to such a wranglyng Wisarde. But Pasiphae
preferred a Bull before a King, and Venus a sméered
Smith before Mars the God of Battayle. Tush, Psomneticus
was Father to Rhodopes Children, whosoeuer
begatte them, and that Cloake is of a course spinning,
that cannot kéepe off the raine. Farewell.
                  
                     Liuing he hopes to reuenge thy iniuries. Wofull Valericus.
                  
               
            
            CAstania no sooner had read these despitefull lynes of
Valericus, but her minde fried with the flames of
furie, and her breast boyled with raging wrath, in such
sort, that she coulde not be in quiet nor take any rest,
she busied her selfe so carefully in studying with what
kinde of reuenge she might best wreake her wrathe vppon
him, and requite his spitefull speaches. At last womanlike,
she found her tongue the best wepon, and with
that she plagued him in this sorte.
            
               
                  
                  Castania to Valericus, neither
health nor good hap.
                  THE Mastiffe Dogge Valericus, can neuer queste
lyke a Spaniell, but hée must alwayes barke lyke
a Curre, it is naturall for the Pye to chatter, for the
Iaye to iangle, and for thée to rayle and rage like a
franticke foole. Dooest thou (thinke Valericus) by
brauling like a beggar to become a king, or by thy
moodlesse follye to obtaine my fauour, no, as I knowe
thy knauerie, so I passe not for thy brauerie: neither can
those vaunts stande for payment, where the partie is
prickte for a péeuish paltring patch. It is no maruell if
thy doggish letters sauoure of Diogenes doctrine, for in
troth thou art such a Cinicall kinde of Dun
                        •
                     e, that thy
fond felicitie is in biting bitterly those, whom otherwise
thou canst not reuenge. In déede gentle Balaams Asse,
if I had bene so lyght as to haue loued you, I myght
iustlye haue bene accused to haue bene a Curre or a
Kystrell, for in faith she that féedes her fancie on thy
face, maye onely reape this profite to fill her eyes full
with the figure of a foole. For my louers Armes Valericus
they are imblased in such a coate, as it is harde for
thée to controwle. But I know thou boastest y• thou hast
gotten thy Antiquitie by conquest, and kéepest thy Letters
patentes in the beggers bor
                        •
                     . Thus adieu Sir
Dunce, the more you mislike mee, the better I loue my
selfe.
                  
                     Thy detested foe, Castania.
                  
               
            
            VAlericus his heart was so hardened with hate, as he
was nothing dismayed with this rigorous reply, but
thought himselfe halfe satisfied, that he hadde thus
            
               
kindly toucht her to the quicke, praying the Gods, that
sith it was not in his possibilitie to make any sufficient
reuenge, they would by some sinister meanes requite hir
crueltie. But leauing him to his dumpes, at last to
Gwydonius, who besides the beautie of his bodie, and
the bountie of his minde (whereat all Alexandria wondred,
had by good gouernment and perfect practise, obtained
such a dexteritie in all things, as in feates of
armes no man more forward, in exercise none more actiue,
in playe none more polliticke, in parle none more
pleasant, amongst his auncients very wise, amongst the
youthfull who more merrie: so that there was no time,
person, nor place, whereto he aptly applyed not himselfe:
insomuch that he entered into such fauour and familyaritie
with Thersandro and Castania, that he was the
onely man whose companie they desired to enioye. But
especially Castania, who by casting a gazing glaunce
some time vpon the beautie of Gwydonius, felte a certayne
restraint of libertie in her affections, an alteration
of minde, and as it were a ciuill assault within
her selfe: but hauing small practise in the pangs of loue,
shée could not coniecture the secret cause of these her soda
                  ••
               e
passions, thinking that as it was a toye lyghtlye
taken, so it would as lightly be left: and vpon this still
she rested, conceiuing onely an ordinarie kinde of liking
towards Gwydonius.
            
            Who bathing thus in the streames of blisse, and
safely harboured in the hauen of happinesse, wanting
nothing which might content his minde, eyther for plesure
or profite, thought it a poynt of méere folly, eyther
to seeke or wish for more than inough, knowing that to
strayne further than the sléeue would stretch, was but
to make the arme bare, and to skippe beyonde a mans
skill, was to leape, but not to knowe where to lyght:
to auoyde therefore hastinesse in hazarding, hée fell a

slumber in the carelesse seate of securite.
            But as it is impossible for a man to sléepe by the Uiper
and not bée inuenomed, to gaze vppon the Cockatrice
and not be infected, to stare vppon the Sunne and
not bée dazeled, to looke vpon Medusas head and not be
transformed, to wade in the waues and not bée drenched,
to handle coales and not be scorched, so it was as
impossible for young Gwydonius to gaze vppon the
beautie of Castania and not bée galled, to fire his eyes
vppon her feature and not bée fettered, to sée her vertuous
qualyties and not bée inueigled: for her courtesie
hadde so incountered him, her modestie hadde so amazed
him, and her charie chastitie so inchaunted him,
that whereas hée came to Orlanio his Courte frée from
affection, hée was nowe become a seruyle Slaue to
Fancie, before a foe to Lust, nowe a friende to Loue:
yea, hée felte such an alienation of his senses, and such
a straunge Metamorphosis of his minde, as reason was
tourned to rage, myrth to mourning, ioye to annoye,
delight to despight, weale to woe, blisse to bale: in
fine, such contrarye passions so perplexed this doubtfull
Patient, as maugre his face, he yéelded the Fort to fancie,
and pulde in the former flagge of defiaunce, intreated
for truce, and beganne to enter parle with Cupide
on this manner.
            O Gwydonius (quoth hée) what straunge chaunce,
naye, what rare chaunge, what sollempne motion,
naye, what sodayne madnesse, what foolish frensie, or
rather what franticke affection hath possessed thée?
            Is thy lawlesse lybertie tourned to a slauish captiuitie?
Is thy fréedome fettered? Are thy sences besotted?
Is thy witte inueygled? Werte thou of late a defier
of Venus, and arte thou nowe a defender of vanitie.

Diddest thou of late renounce beautie as a foe, and wilt
thou now imbrace her as a friende. Is this the carefull
keeping of thy Fathers commaundement, or is this
thy diligent duetie in obseruing the counsayle of thy
olde Sire Clerophontes? Hast thou so soone forgotte his
fatherlye precepts, or committed to oblyuion his friendlye
aduertisement? Did hée carefully warne thée to beware
of Loue, and wilt thou carelessely wedde thy selfe
to Lust? Did he shewe thée what poysoned ban
                  •
                is hidden
vnder the painted baites of beautie, and wilt thou
be haled to the hooke?
            O haplesse case: naye rather, if the charye charge
thy Father gaue thée, will be no constraint, if his counsayle
will not commaunde thée, if his warning wil not
make thée warie, nor his aduice be thy aduertisement:
yet let imminent perills, and insuing daungers bée a
precious preseruatiue against future calamities. Consider
with thy selfe Gwydonius, what difference is betwéene
fréedome and bondage, betwéene libertie and
captiuitie, mirth and mourning, pleasure and payne,
rest and care, happinesse and heauinesse: and so farre
dooth he which is frée frō affection differ from him which
is fettered in fancie.
            Why but Gwydonius, why doost thou thus recklesly
rage against reason? Why doost thou thus fondly exclayme
agaynst thine owne welfare? Why doost thou
condempne thy selfe of that crime whereof thou art not
guyltie.
            Thy Father warned thée to beware of fickle
fancie, but this thy lyking is firme affection. Hys
counsayle was to perswade thée from leawde lust,
but not from lawfull loue, from vanitie, not from vertue:
yea, his will was to wish thée from lykeing such
a lewd minion, who had neither birth, welth nor vertue,

but a little fading beautie to be either her credite or thy
countenance, not to warne thée from louing such a chast
maiden, nay a péereles Princesse, whose birth may countenaunce
thy calling, whose power may promote thée,
whose liuings may inrich thée, whose vertue maye aduaunce
thée: yea, in obtaining whome, thou shalt gaine
both honour, and perhaps the inheritaunce of a Dukedome.
            Doost thou thinke then Gwydonius in winning so
worthie a péece, to purchase thy Fathers displeasure,
nay assure thy selfe he will not onelye be content with
thy chaunce, but he will thinke thou hast runne a happier
race, than Hyppomanes did in winning Atlanta.
Content with thy chaunce? Why Gwydonius art thou
so fonde a foole, as to count the Castle conquered, that
as yet thou hast not compassed: to suppose the Citie sacked,
which thou hast not beséeged: to thinke the bulwarke
beaten, which as yet thou hast not battered: or
to count the Ladie wonne, whome as yet thou hast not
wooed. Nay Gwydonius, if thou weigh thy case in
the equall Ballaunce, thou hast more cause of feare
than of hope, of doubte than of assuraunce, of
myssing thy pretence, than of obtayning thy purpose.
            The Fawlchon (Gwydonius seldome perketh with
the Merlyne, the Lyon seldome lodgeth with the
Mouse, the Hart seldome féedeth with the Pricket, Aquila
non capit Muscas, and a Dame indued with Nobilitie,
vouchsafeth not to match with a man of meane
Gentilitie. Of meane Gentilitie Gwydonius? yea
truely, for Castania rather thinketh thée sprong of some
poore peasaunt, than of anye princely personage.
            Besides, alas Fortune her selfe denieth me anye
such fauour, my good will as yet hath deserued no
suche gwerdon, my desire is farre aboue my deserts,

my ambition aboue my condition, and the poore staye of
wandering Gwydonius farre vnfit for the princely state
of worthie Castania. But put case she did will as I did,
wish that she wer pricked in ye same veine, caught in the
same snare, trapped with the like traine, &amp; fired with the
like fancie, yet the Duke her father will neither condescend
to her mind, nor consent to my motiō, neither think
well of her liking nor of my loue, nay if he shoulde but
once heare of such recklesse folly, as he hath wrought
my promotion, so he would worke my confusion, as hée
hath bene my friend, so he would be my foe, and in troth
Gwydonius not without cause, for art thou so voide of
vertue, or vowed to vice, so nursed vp in vanitie, or nusled
vp in villanie, as to requite his liberalitie with such
disloialtie, to returne the trust which he reposeth in the
                  •
               
with such treason. Tush, Loue is aboue Lord or Lawe,
friend or faith. Where Loue leadeth, no master is made
account off: no king cared for, no friende forced off, no
dutie respected, but all things done according to the qualitie
y• is predominant. Why Gwydonius, what doubts
are these that thou thus dreamest on? Why dost thou cast
beyond the Moone, and feare before thou art in daunger
to fall: knowing that Loue and Fortune desireth not
them that are dastards, nor careth not for them that are
cowardes. The Captaine that retireth from the walls
before he hath the repulse, shall neuer returne a conquerour,
the Souldier that fainteth before the battaile bée
fought, shal neuer vaunt himself of victorie. He that feareth
euerie tempest is not fit to be a trauailer. He that
doubteth euerie waue shall neuer proue a perfect Pylot,
and he that in loue dreadeth euerie chip of mischance,
may well encounter, but neuer obtaine the conquest.
            Sith then Gwydonius, hardie venturing is a signe of
happie victorie, sound out the march with the trumpet of
trust, beginne the assault, giue the onset. Laie the battering

péeces of loue, against the bulwarke of beautye,
and no doubt thy successe shall bée such as thou shalt triumph
with Caesar and saie, Veni, Vidi, Vici. And art
thou so presumptuous fonde foole, as to promise thy selfe
the conquest, knowest thou not that the path of loue is
perillous. And with that he fell into such melancholike
passions, such contrarie cogitations, such doubtfull
thoughtes, such fearefull supposes, that as hée which
cateth of the Goorde roote looseth his memorye, and as
the Elephaunt when hée eateth of the Helitropion leafe,
is then verie sléepie, so Gwydonius was so perplexed
with these vnacquainted passions, that contrarie to his
custome hée hadde driuen mirth into mourning, pleasaunt
conceites into painefull cares, laughing into lowring,
singing into sorrowe, as béeing thus besotted to
solace himselfe, hée went into a Parke adioyning to the
Dukes Pallace, where sitting vnder the shade of a béech
trée, leaning his head on his hande, he laye as one in a
slumber. But Fortune willing somewhat to fauour
this young Nouice, brought it so to passe, that Tersandro,
Valericus, Castania and Melytta, with diuerse other
gentlemen, were for recreation sake, raunging in ye same
Parke, who espying ghostly Gwydonius 
               
                  •
               itting as one in
a traunce, Castania passing before the rest, pulling him
by the sléeue, draue him thus out of his dumpe.
            WHy how now Gwydonius (quoth shée) are you dreaming
or doubting, or is your minde musing vpon
some metaphusicall motions, that you sit thus as a man
half mortified, your solempne iesture makes me remember
the picture of Pigmalion, which once I sawe portrayed
out by a skilfull painter, who leaning his head on his
Marble mistres, (that so vnfainedly he loued) sate wyth
his
                  •
               eyes as one in a slumber, hauing his face notwythstanding
so bedewed with brinish teares, as his outward

plaintes did sufficiently bewraie his inward passions.
In truth Gwydonius I had taken thée for Pigmalion, if
thou hadst hadde teares as thou wert in a traunce, for
thou doest not greatly differ from him neither in countenaunce
nor colour, wel if it were but a dreame Gwydonius,
that thus combred thy conscience, or a doubte that
made thée thus dumpish, I wil deuine the one if it be not
to darke, or decide the other, if it be not too secrete, marie
if the case be combersome, I leaue it to the iudgement of
these Gentlemen.
            
               GWydonius wakened out of his musing slumber wyth
this sugured harmonie, séeing before his eyes his gorgeous
Goddesse, the verie Saint, at whose shrine he was
offering vp scalding sighes, farre fetcht sobbes, plaintes,
prayers, and protestations, was so appalde with her presence,
that as the Basiliske looseth his sences with the
sight of a naked man, as the Torteise séeing the North
starre is benummed, as the Hermeline looking on the
stone Echites is greatly amazed, so Gwydonius séeing the
incomperable beautie of his best beloued Castania, was
so astonished, yea, so inchaunted with the rare perfection
of this heauenly Pallas, that as one besotted he sate sencelesse,
not being able to vtter one worde, vntill at length
reuiued with the view of her chéerefull countenance, he
repaide her with this pleasaunt aunswere.
            MAdame (quoth he) whereas iestingly you saye, that
at the first sight you had taken me for perplexed Pigmalion
by my pittifull plaintes and carefull countenaunce,
but that I wanted trickeling teares to decypher
my sorrowe, I aunswere, that woe may verie well bée
wythout watrie wailinges, for when the Stone Garatides
fryeth wythout, it fréezeth within, the Germaunder
leafe, when it is most full of moisture, looketh

then most drie, where the streame is most déepe, there it
is most still, and where is the smallest shewe of teares,
there is the greatest signe of sorrowe. And also I call the
heauens to witnesse, that when you wakened me out of
my dreame by your diuine eloquence, I tooke you either
for beautie to be Venus, for comelynesse to be Pallas,
or for port and honour to be Iuno, so that both your presence
and curtesie daunted my minde, your presence in
dazeling my eies so sodainely with so solempne a sight,
your curtesie, in that your Ladyship without curiositie
would vouchsafe to talke with so meane a Gentleman.
But Madame, sith that I perceiue your skill in nauigation
to be great, in that you made so cunning a coniecture,
and without anie great aiming, so rightly hitte the
marke, to put you out of doubt, I confesse I was both in
a dreame and a doubt, wherein sith it pleaseth your honour
to take so much paine, I will craue your aide to deuine
the one, and decide the other.
            
               
                  
                     
                        The Dreame.
                        I Was walking (Madame Castania) in my dreame,
(as I supposed) solitarily by the sea side, where, as I
tooke delight to sée the Dolphins leape (which as the Mariners
saie is a signe of imminent tempest) I forthwith
espyed a rocke in the sea, wherevpon stoode a Ladie araied
with roabes of burnisht golde▪ so formed and framed,
so adorned and decked with the giftes of Nature, as at
the first I tooke her to bée Thetis, that had so gorgeouslye
clad her selfe, to welcome home her louer and Lord Neptunus.
But viewing her countenaunce more narrowly,
I perceiued her to be a mortall creature (though vnworthie
such diuine beautie should be shrouded in the substaunce
of an earthly carcasse) which so inflamed my affection,
so fired my fancie, &amp; sp kindled my desire, that the

tormentes of Tantalus, the torture of Ixion, the sorrowe
of Sisiphus, were not halfe comperable to the perplexed
passions that pinched my haplesse heart, when I sawe all
hope cut awaie from inioying this earthly Goddesse, the
sea which compassed the rocke was so déepe and daungerous,
the cliffes so stéep-downe and fearefull, as to descend
was no lesse daunger then death it selfe, thus as I
surged in griefe, and wandered vp and downe in woe, I
spied a bridge a farre off, whereby was a passage to the
rocke, which sight so salued my forepassed sorrow, and so
reuiued my daunted minde, as I was driuen into an extasie
for ioy, to sée so good meanes to inioy my wished desire.
Comming to the bridge, I found it built of glasse so
cunningly, and so curiously, as if Nature her selfe had
sought to purchase credit by framing so curious a péece
of workmanship. But yet so slenderly, as ye least waight
was able to pash it into innumerable péeces, and vnderneath
the bridge did run so terrible a sea, such bouncing
billowes, such tumbling waues, such fearefull surges,
such roaring stremes, such hideous goulfs, as it made
the passage séeme a thousand times more perillous. This
terrible sight was such a cooling Card to my former conceits,
as hope was turned to feare, blisse to bale, &amp; supposed
happinesse to assured heauinesse. And yet my fancie
was not quenched, but rather far the more inflamed, my
desire was not diminished, but augmented, &amp; my liking
no lesse, but rather inlarged, so that to liue in loue without
hope was loathsome, to séeke redresse was losse of
life, to want my wish was horror, to inioy my will was
hell, to liue in care without comfort was calamitie, to
séeke for cure was more th
                              •
                            miserie, not to possesse ye pray
was hellish daunger, to venture for the prize was haples
death. Thus crossed with cares, &amp; daunted with such diuers
doubts, desperate hope so repulsed direfull feare, y•
incouraged by ventrous desire, I hadde either obtained

my wish, or wanted of my will, if your Ladyshippe had
not so sodainely wakened me out of my slumber. Thus
madame Castania, you haue heard my dreame, now the
doubt is, whether it had ben better to haue ventured vppon
the brickle bridge, and so either desperatly to haue
ended cares with death, or else valiantly to haue inioyed
desire with renowme, or still like a fearefull dastard
to haue ended my dayes in lingering loue with myserie.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               Castania hearing the surmised dreame of Gwydonius,
both smelled the fetch, and smiled at the follie of this
young youth, knowing that these fantastical visions and
presupposed passions, would in time (if he tooke not héed)
proue but too true, to preuent therefore such imminent
perills, shée nipt her young nouice on the pate with this
parle.
            
            
               GWydonius (quoth shée) I haue listened to thy drousie
dreame, with déep deuotion, by so much the more desirous
attentiuely to heare it, by howe much the more I
finde it straunge and wonderfull: yea, so straunge as if
I my selfe had not wakened thée out of thy slumber, I
would either haue thought it a fained vision, or a fantasticall
inuention, but sith these Gentlemen héere present
&amp; mine owne eyes are witnesses, &amp; thine owne tongue a
testimonie of thy talke, suffice I beléeue it, though I can
not diuine it: to giue a verdit where the euidence is not
vnderstood is vanitie, to yéeld a reason of an vnknowen
case is méere folly, and to interpret so straunge a dreame
without great practise is but to skip beyond my skill,
and so lay fast in the mire. Yet least I might séeme to
promise much and performe nothing, I will decide your
doubt if you please to take my doome for a censure.
            It is a saying Gwydonius, not so common as true,
that the hastie man neuer wantes woe, and that hée

which is rash wythout reason, seldome or neuer sléepeth
without repentaunce. To venture amiddest the Pikes
when perills cannot bée 
                  •
               schewed, is not fortitude but
folly, to hazarde in daungers, when death ensueth is
not to bée worthely minded, but wilfully mooued. Uertue
alwayes consisteth betwéene extremities, that as
too much fearefulnesse is the signe of a quaking coward,
so too much rashnesse betokeneth a desperate Ruffian.
Manhoode Gwydonius consisteth in measure and
worthynesse, in fearing to hazard without hope. But to
giue a verdite by thine owne voyce, I perceiue thou art
guiltie of the same crime, for when the bricklenesse of
the Bridge portended death, and the surging Seas inferred
losse of lyfe, yet desire draue thée to aduenture so
desperate a daunger. Better it is Gwydonius to liue
in griefe, then to die desperatelye without grace: better
to choose a lingering lyfe in miserie, then a spéedie
death without mercie, better to bée tormented wyth
haplesse fancie then with hellish fiends, for in lyfe it is
possible to represse calamity, but after death neuer to redresse
miserie. Tully Gwydonius in his Tusculans questions,
discoursing of the happinesse of life and heauinesse
of death, sayth, that to lyue we obtaine it of the louing
Gods, but to die, of the vnluckie destinies: meaning
heereby, that lyfe though neuer so loathsome, is better
then death, though neuer so welcome: whereby I conclude
Gwydonius, that to liue carfully, is better then to
die desperatly.
            
               Gwydonius perceiuing that Castanias parle was
nothing to the purpose, and that shée toucht not that
point whereof hée desired most to bée absolued, but
meant to shake him off wyth a flée
                  •
               elesse aunswere,
beganne to drawe her to the Trappe wyth this
traine▪
            
            
               MAdame Castania (quoth he) I confesse that rashnesse
neuer raigneth without repentaunce, nor hastie hazarding
without haplesse harmes, that he which aduentureth
desperate daungers is a foole, &amp; he that passeth ineuitable
perills is worse then an Asse: Yet from these so
generall rules Madame, I exempt these perticular exceptions,
namely Loue &amp; Necessitie, which two are tied wtin
no bonds, nor limitted within no law, for whom ye diuel
driues he must néedes run, be the passage neuer so perillous:
and whom Loue or Necessitie forceth, he must venture
be the daunger neuer so desperate: for as there is no
enterprise so easie which to an vnwilling man séemeth
not verie hard to bée atchieued, so there is no incounter
so combersome where will wisheth, that séemeth not passing
easie to bée perfourmed, nowe this will is with nothing
sooner pricked forwarde, then either with the force
of Loue, or sting of necessitie. So that whosoeuer aduentureth
in a daunger, though neuer so desperate, is
not to be blamed, if inforced by fancie, or incouraged by
affection, and especially where the perill is in possibilytie
to bee passed without death, and in the performaunce
thereof, the possession of such a prise as the passionate
person more estéemeth then lands, limmes, or lyfe it selfe,
bée it neuer so swéete. In which case madame my cause
consisteth. For the Ladie who was an heauenly obiect to
my glasing eies, was so beautified with the giftes of nature,
and so perfectly pollished with more then naturall
perfection, that with the only view of such diuine beutie,
my sences were so besotted, my wit &amp; will so inueigled,
my affection so inflamed, &amp; any fréedome so fettered, yea,
Loue alreadie had made so greate a breach into the bulwarke
of my breast, that to obtaine so gorgeous a Goddesse,
I thought death no daunger, though neuer so direfull,
nor losse of lyfe no torment, though neuer so terrible.
            
               In déed Gwydonius quoth Thersandro, I agrée with
thée in this poynt, that there is no carpet Knight so cowardly
that wold not passe most perillous pikes to possesse
so liuely a Dame as thou doost decypher, nor no dastard
so daunted with dread which would not greatlye
indanger himselfe to inioy so louely a damsell, in y• fruition
of whom consisteth nothing but ioy, blisse, rest, contentation
of minde, delight, happinesse, yea, all earthlye
felicitie.
            And yet Sir (quoth Gwydonius) your sister Castania
condemnes me of follye, in ventring for so precious
a price, when as hope perswaded me, that no hazarde
could be haples, and assured me that Loue and Fortune
fauoureth them that are bold: that the Gods themselues
séeing my perplexed passions, would of pittie defend me
from those perillous daungers. For if Theseus by Diuine
power were ayded against the force of the monstrous
Minotaure, or if Iason, who constrained with a
couetous desire to obtaine the golden Fléece, arryuing
at Colchos, was preserued by the Gods, from the dint of
the deadly Dragons, no doubt Iupiter himselfe woulde
either haue made the staggering bridge more strong (cō
               sidering
that no hope of wealth, no desire of riches, no
gréedinesse of gaine, no loue of lucre, but beautie her
selfe was the victorie I meant to vaunt of,) or els
if I hadde sowsed in the roaring Seas, hée woulde
haue prouided some happie Dolphin, that Arion lyke, I
might arriue at the desired Rocke: and then my daungers
should haue bene tourned into delight, my perilles
into pleasures, my hazarding into happinesse: yea, I
should haue possessed that heauenly paragon, and enioyed
the loue of that louelye Venus, whose onelye sight
were a sufficient salue, against all fore-passed sorrowes.
            Staye there Master Gwydonius (quoth the Ladye

               Melytta) for I sée to graunt one false proposition, is to
open a doore to innumerable absurdities, and that by suffering
you too long, of these supposed premisses, you wil
inferre some cauillyng conclusion to your former reasons:
thus I replye. That I confesse necessitie to haue
no lawe, but I graunt not the same of Loue: for if it
be lawlesse, it is leawde: if without lymittes, lasciuious:
if contayned within no boundes, beastlye: if obserued
with no order, odious: so that lawlesse Loue
without reason, is the verye Load-stone to ruth and ruine.
            Sith then Master Gwydonius as your selfe affirme,
this was the pricke that pusht you into perill, how can
the effect be good, when the cause was naught, or howe
can you clearkly defend your desperate motion, procéeding
of such a fonde and foolish occasion. But it was the
perfection of her comelye person, her exquisite feature,
and rare beautie, that so kindled thy desire, and so bewitched
thy sences: for, who is so fearefull that beautie
will not make bolde? who so doubtfull, that beautie wil
not make desperate? yea, what so harde that a man
will not hazarde, to obtayne so diuine a thyng, as
beautie.
            Oh Gwydonius, hast thou not hearde the Fish Remora
lystening to the sounde of a Trumpet is caught
of the Fishers, that while the Porcupine standeth staring
at the glymmering of the starres, hée is ouer-taken
with dogges, that the Deare gazing at the bowe is striken
with the bolte, that the Leoparde looking at the
Panthers paynted skinne is taken as a praye, and that
he which taketh too much delyght to gaze vpon beautie,
is oftentimes galled with griefe and miserie. Yea, his
pleasure shall inferre such profite, and his good wil such
gayne, as if he reapte the beautifull apples of Tantalus,
               
which are no sooner toucht, but they tourne to ashes.
            Beautie Gwydonius, no sooner flourisheth but it fadeth,
and it is not fullye ripe before it beginne to rot: it no
sooner blossometh but it withereth, and scarcelye béeing
toucht it stayneth, lyke to the Guyacum leafe, that hath
the one halfe parched, before the other halfe be perfect: to
the Birde Acanthis, which hatched white, yet tourneth
blacke at the first storme: or lyke to the Stone Astites,
that chaungeth colour with the onelye breath of a
man.
            If then Gwydonius, Beautie be so fading, so fickle,
so momentarie, so moouing, so withering, so waning, so
soone passed, and so soone parched: is this the Iewell,
which you count more déere than life? and the Iemme
which you thinke worthie to be purchased with the danger
of death? No doubt Gwydonius, if you wonne the
victorie, you might vaunt of a great Conquest, and if
your long hope were repayed with a great happe, it
shoulde bée much lyke to his, which thinking to embrace
Iuno, caught nothing but a vanishing clowde.
            You doo well Madame (quoth Castania) to put an
If, in it, because hée that vaunteth of victorie before hée
hath wonne the fielde, maye prooue himselfe a foole: hée
that bragges of gaines before the accompts be cast, may
perhappes put his winnings in his eyes: and hée that
bloweth the Mort before the fall of the Buck, may very
well misse of his fées: so he that counts himselfe a spéeder
before he be a wooer, sheweth himselfe a vaine person
or a vaunting patch.
            Might it not bée I praye you Master Gwydonius,
that passing the bridge scaping the dangerous seas, &amp; happely
arriuing at the desired Rocke, yet you might misse
of your purpose? Yes forsooth: for many a man bendeth
his bow, y• neuer killeth his game, laieth y• strap y• neuer

catcheth the fowle, pitcheth the Net that neuer getteth
the fish, &amp; long time are heauie wooers that neuer proue
happie speeders.
            So perhaps Gwydonius you might be crossed with a
chippe of the same mischaunce, and the gorgeous Dame
whome you adore for a Goddesse might repaye your liking
with loathing, your loue with hate, your good will
with despite and your fixed fancie with small affection,
either that she lyked you too little, or loued another too
much. All these doubts Gwydonius are carefullye to be
cast, and wisedome it is to feare the worst, and finde the
best: but you Sir like a lustie champion, thinke a Ladie
won at the first looke, and the good will of women
gained at the first glaunce, thinking the Gods thēselues
are to be accused of iniustice, if they be not ayders to
your enterprise, insomuch that if in ventring ouer the
perilous passage, you had by disaster Fortune fallen into
the daungerous Seas, you doubted not but that Iupiter
would haue sent a Dolphin, that Arion like you
might escape the fearefull surges: but Gwydonius bée
not so ventrous, least though you harpe very long, you
get not the like hap. These premisses considered, if my
censure might stand for a sentence, I déeme it better to
be counted a dastardly coward, than a desperate caitife,
better to forsake your Goddesse, than your God, better
to lyue pinched with a few momentarie passions, than
with desperate death to destroy both soule and body: for
there is no sore such which in time may not be salued,
no care such which cannot bée cured, no fire so greate
which may not bée quenched, no loue, liking, fancie, or
affection, which in time may not either be repressed, or
redressed.
            
               Valericus hearing this rough replye of Castania, supposed
that although she leuelled at Gwydonius, yet shée
shot at him, and fearing the fort should be too much shashaken

with this fearce assault, he stifly defended the
walles with this fresh Alarum.
            MAdam quoth hée, I se you will sit nye the wals eare
you be thrust out for a wrangler, and that you will
speake against your owne conscience, but you will haue
the conquest: for my owne part Madame, howsoeuer I
séeme to lyke it, I will not saye I mislike it, but I am
sorrie you Madame Melitta shoulde so blasphemouslye
imblaze the Armes of beautie, and so recklesselye
rayle against the sacred lawes of loue: sake héed
                  •
               
for crossing Cupid so crabbedlye, for though he forgiue
and forget, Venus is a woman, and will s
                  •
               eke reuenge.
            
               Valericus (quoth she) take no care what daunger I
incurre for speaking the truth, if I chaunce to bee harmed,
it is mine owne mishap, and for Venus reuenge I
care for it the lesse because I feare it not: if I speake
against my selfe, you may sée I am the fitter to bée a
Iudge, because I am not partiall, nor haue any respect
of persons.
            These quippes Madame (quoth Gwydonius) are nothing
to the purpose, therefore in the behalfe of my selfe
and beautie thus I answere. That as there is nothing
that so soone procureth a man to loath as deformitie, so
there is nothing which sooner perswadeth a man to loue
than beautie, for the most precious stone is chosen by the
most glystering hiew, the purest golde by the most perfect
colour, the best fruite by the brauest blossomes, and
the best conditions by the swéetest countenaunce, so that
where beautie raineth, there vertue remaineth, and vnder
a faire face resteth a faithfull heart. Sith then beautie
and bountie cannot be parted, what man is hée so
brutish, whom the least of these will not make to break
or bende?
            
               
And wheras you condemn me of vanitie for vaunting
before the victorie, I say, that if fortune had so fauored
mée, that I had gayned the presence of my Goddesse, I
would neuer haue doubted to haue obtained my desire:
for if she had séene the desperate daunger which I aduē
               tured,
and the fearefull perilles which I passed for her
sake, she coulde not but of conscience, repaye my loue
with vnfayned loyaltie, and my good will with treble
gaine. And in troth I thinke it vnpossible, that such heauenlye
beautie shoulde bée eclypsed with crueltye,
and such perfect comelynesse be blemesht with curious
coynesse.
            Why Gwydonius (quoth she) doost thou call it crueltie,
not to condiscende to the request of euerie one that
wooeth, or doost thou tearme it coynesse not to yéelde
to the assaulte of euerye flattering Louer, then in my
iudgement it were good for euerye woman to bee both
cruell and coye, that by crueltie she might auoyde the
traine of trothlesse wooers, and by coynesse 
                  •
               schewe the
troupe of faithlesse suters.
            And so Madame (quoth Valericus) she should reape
small comfort and lesse credit.
            Tush Signor Valericus (quoth Gwydonius) it pleaseth
her thus merelye to iest, whereas I knowe shée
dooth accompt more of a courteous Dame, than of a
curyous Damsell, and that her Ladishippe so detesteth
the name of crueltye, that shée woulde bee loath to bée
thought to haue a mynde deuoyde of mercie. And in
troth to leaue these particular instaunces, women in
generall, or for the most parte, are bountifull, courteous,
sober, chaste, demure, not imbrued with vice, but
indued with vertue: so that by howe much womens
bodies are weaker than mens, by so much their mindes
are more strong and vertuous.
            What Gwydonius (quoth she) doo you thinke to bée

a frée-man in Wales, for offering a léeke to Saint Dauie,
or to bring Pan into a fooles Paradise, by praysing
his Pipe.
            Not so Madame (quoth he) but I hope in extollyng
a Souldiours life to haue Saint George to my friend,
and in giuing verdit with Venus to gaine her good wil,
and to reape the reward that Paris had for his censure.
            Marie sir (quoth Castania) if you haue no better gettings,
you may gaine long inough, and yet liue by the
losse: for in obtaining one friend, you shall reape two
foes as Paris did, who was more plagued by Pallas and
Iuno, than pleasured by flattering Venus.
            
            And yet Madam (qd he) his mishap shall not make me
to beware: for if Venus wold grant me but one Lady in
the world, whom most entirely I loue, I would neither
respect Pallas, Iuno, nor Diana her selfe, were she neuer
so despitefull.
            Yes but you wold (quoth she) if she pinched you but
with Acteons plague, to pester your heade with as many
hornes as a Har
                  •
               . It wold cause you coniecture your
new Mistresse were too much giuen to the game, or that
thou wert come from Cornetto by discent.
            Tush Madame (quoth he) doo you count Acteons hap
such a great harme, the only sight in séeing Diana naked,
was a recompense for all his ensuing sorrowes, and if
my selfe might inioye my wish, and obtaine the heuenly
Dame that so hartely I desire, the plague of Acteon,
nay ye griping grief
                  •
               , ye ghostly spirits do suffer, shuld not
counteruaile the ioye I shoulde conceiue in inioying so
péerelesse a Iewell.
            Truly (quoth Thersandro) thou art worthie Gwydonius
to be a chapman, that thou bids so well for thy
chaffer, and in my minde she is not in Alexandria, who
for her beautie is so to be loued, or at ye least wold déeme
thée not worthy to be liked. But leuing these amorous

discourses, let vs hye vs in hast to the Court, least in
tarrying Orlanio misse
                  •
                vs, and so we be shent. The companie
obaying the minde of Thersandro, passed as spéedely
as might be to the Pallaice, where being arriued,
they departed euery man to his owne lodging.
            
               Castania had no sooner conueyed her selfe closely into
her chamber, but her minde was moued with a thousand
sundry motions, and she felt such a cruell conflict in
her haplesse hart, by the assault of diuers contrarie passions,
that how stoutly so euer she defended the walles,
she found her force too weak to resist the rage of so recklesse
a tyrant. Now the prayers Valericus powred forth
came to effect, now Venus meant to be reuenged for the
crueltie she vsed to her valiant Captain Valericus, who
so valiantly had fought vnder the flagge of affection,
and yet could by no meanes preuayle. For Castania hearing
the sugured Eloquence, which so swéetlye flowed
from the sappie wit of Gwydonius, framing in her fancie
the forme of his face, and printing in her heart the
perfection of his person, was so intangled in the snares
of Loue, as shée coulde by no reason redresse her miserie,
but will shée, nyll shée, fell into these bitter complaints.
            ALas witlesse wretch (quoth she) that I am, what fierie
flames of fancie doo frie within mée? what desire,
what lust, what hope, what trust, what care, what dispaire,
what feare, what furie? that to be payned wyth
these perplexed passions, to me that neuer felt the force
of them before, is no lesse dolour than death it selfe, bee
it neuer so dyrefull. O Gods, where are nowe become
those loftye lookes I vsed to Valericus? Where
is the disdaynefull dealynges, the coye countenaunces,
the curyous congies, the causelesse crueltie?
            Yea, the harde heart, which so rigorouslye reiected the

loue of him which so entirely liked me. Could I, fonde
foole that I am, valiauntly withstande the assaults of a
worthie Gentleman, &amp; shall I cowardly yéeld to an vnknowen
straūger: did I loath him whose parentage was
little inferiour to mine, and shall I loue another of base
and vild birth: did I disdaine to looke at the lure, and
shall I now stoope without stall, come without call: yea,
and to such an emptie fist, O lawlesse Loue, O witlesse
will, O fancie, fraught full of phrensie and furie. Alasse,
if I should be so carelesse as to consent to this franticke
toie, what will they say, that praised me for my vertue?
will they not as fast dispraise me for my vanitie, wil not
my father fret, my kinsfolke crie out, my friendes be sorrie,
my fo
                  •
               s and especially Valericus, laugh me to scorne,
and triumph of this my mishap: yea, wil not all y• world
wonder to sée me alate giuen to chastitie, and now shake
hands with virginitie, to yéeld my déerest iewell &amp; chiefest
treasure into ye hands of a stragling straunger, who
came to my fathers court without countenance or coine,
wealth or worshippe, credit or calling: yea, who by his
owne report is but a person of small parentage. Séeke
then Castania to asswage this flame, and to quench this
fire, which as it commeth wtout cause, so it wil consume
without reason. For the greatest flowe hath the soonest
ebbe, the sorest tempest hath the most sodaine calme, the
hottest loue hath the coldest end, and of the déepest desire
oft times ensueth the deadlyest hate: so that she which
settles her affection wt such spéed as she makes her choice
without discreation, may cast her corne she knowes not
where, and reapes she wots not what, and for her hastie
choosing, may perhaps get a heauie bargaine. Alasse, I
knowe this counsaile is good, but what then? can I denie
that which the destinies haue decréede, is it in my power
to peruert that which the Planets haue placed? can I
resist that which is stirred vp by the starres? No, what

néede I then make this exclamation, sith I am not the
first nor shall not be the last whom the frantike phrensie
of flickering fancie, hath with more wrong and greater
vauntage piteously oppressed. What though Gwydonius
be not wealthie, yet he is wise, though he be not of
great parentage, yet he is of comelye personage, it is not
his coine that hath conquered me, but his countenaunce,
not his vading riches, but his renowmed vertues, &amp; I far
more estéeme a man then money: I but the Duke my father
is not so base minded as to bestow me vpō so meane
a Gentleman, he neuer will consent that poore Gwydonius
shuld inioy y• which he hopeth some pearlesse prince
shall possesse. What then? shall I preferre my Fathers
weale before mine own wil, his liking before mine own
loue? no, no, I will choose for my selfe whatsoeuer my
choice be. Why but perchance Gwydonius will no more
estéeme thee then thou didst Valericus, &amp; repay thée with
as smal fancy as thou him with affection. Tush, doubt it
not Castania, thou art y• dame which he so deciphered in
his dreme, thou art y• 
               Venus which he saw in his visiō, y•
art y• goddesse, whose beauty hath so bewitched him, y• art
y• iewell to possesse, y• which ther is no hap so hard which
he would not hazard, no daunger so desperate which hée
wold not aduenture, no burden so heuie which he wold
not beare, nor no perill so huge which he wold not passe.
And shall not then Gwydonius be my seruant, sith I am
his Saint, shall not I like him which loueth mée, sith
he is my ioy, shall I not inioye him? Yes, Gwydonius
is mine, and shall bée mine in despight of the fates
and Fortune.
            
               Castania hauing thus pittifully powred out her plaints
would gladly haue giuen Gwydonius intelligence (with
modestie if she might) of her good will towardes him, &amp;
god knows how faine Gwydonius wold haue discouered
his feruent affection, if too much feare had not astonished

him, &amp; too great bashfulnes staied her. She therfore houering
betwéene feare &amp; hope, perseuered so long in his pensiue
passions &amp; careful cogitations, y• by couert concealing
of her inward sorrow, the flame so furiously fried within
her, that she was constrained to kéepe her bed. Whervpon
Melytta coniecturing the cause of her care by y• colour
of her countenaunce, thought to sift out the occasion
of her sorrow, y• by this meanes she might apply a medicine
to her maladie, &amp; finding fit opportunitie, she brake
with her in this wise.
            Madame Castania (quoth shée) since I haue by y• Duke
your father bene assigned to you as a companion, I haue
in such louing wise both comforted &amp; counselled you, as
I hope you haue iust cause to say y• I haue most carefully
tendred your estate, for perceiuing how willing you
were to follow my direction, I counted your wealth my
weale, your pleasure my profite, your happinesse my ioy,
&amp; your prosperitie my felicitie. Which friendly care if it
wer
                  •
                not to be considered, if I shuld shew you what great
sorrow I sustaine by your heauinesse, you would iudge
my words to procéede either of folly or flatterie, but if
your sore be such as it may be salued, if your care may be
cured, if your grief may be redressed, or your malady mitigated
by my means, cōmand me good Castania in what
I may to pleasure thée, &amp; thou shalt find me so charely to
performe my charge, as my willing mind shall euidētly
bewray my well meaning. I see Castania, of late, such
a straunge Metamorphosis in thy minde, as for pleasant
conceits thou dost vse pensiue cogitations, thy chéerefull
countenance is changed into lowring lookes, thy merrie
deuises into mournful dumps, &amp; yet I cannot coniecture
no cause of this sodaine alteration. If want of riches
should worke thy woe, why thou swimst in wealth, if
losse of friends? thou hast infinit of noble parētage, which
loues thée most entirely. If thou meanest no longer to

leade a single life, no doubt thy father will prouide thée
of such a princely match, as shall content thée for his person,
and countenaunce thée with his parentage. But if
in all these supposes I haue mist the marke, and haue
not toucht the case of thy calamitie, vnfolde vnto me Castania
what the paine is that thus doth pinch thee, and assure
thy selfe, I will be so secrete in thy affaires, as euer
Lampana was to her Ladie Cleophila.
            
            
               Castania hearing this friendly discourse of Melytta,
thought for al this faire glose ye text might be to intricate,
&amp; that these painted spéeches would proue but rotten pillers,
fearing therefore the fetch, and doubting the worst,
if shée bewraie her minde, shée framed her this aunswere.
            MAdame (quoth she) the incomperable curtesie and vnfained
friendship which since your first comming I
haue found in you by experience, will neither suffer mée
to suspect your Ladyshippe of flatterie, nor my selfe willingly
to be accused of ingratitude, for your diligence
hath bene so great, &amp; my deserts so small, that if I might
but liue to requite some parte of your good will, it were
the second felicitie I looke for in this life. But touching
the pensiue passions which thus diuersly perplexed mée,
I aunswere, that as he which is wounded of the Bores
tuske, if his sore take aire is verie hardly healed, as hée
which stroken with a Scorpion if his wound take wind
can neuer be cured: so madame, many inward maladies
carry this nature, that if they be once discouered
                  •
                they are
far the more hardly recouered, that it is better to conceale
them with griefe, then reueale them in hope of reléefe.
            Not so Castania, your principle is not true, for if your
passions procéeded of loue, which of all other inward
sores requireth greatest secrecie, yet vndoubtedly y• more

it is discouered, the sooner it is cur
                  •
               d, for as the sto
                  •
               e of
Armenia béeing couered with sande, burneth most extreamly,
and no sooner taketh aire but it cooleth, so the firie
flames of loue raked vp in silence, frie most furiously,
but béeing by discourse dis
                  •
               losed, they soone conuert
from flame to fume and smoke. Wherfore good Castania
impart vnto me the matter which doeth import thée so
néere, and I sweare vnto thée by the sacred rites of Caeres,
which is so honoured in Alexandria, that if thou doost
loue where thy friends do not like, and thy wish be contrarie
to their will, yet I will séeke all meanes possible
to redresse thy sorrowe.
            Alasse good mada
                  ••
               e, rather then you shoulde thinke
mée so incredulous or suspitious, as not to beléeue your
oth, or doubt of your secret dealing, I will without delay
make you priuie to the cause of my paine, what perill so
euer I incurre by reuealing it. So it is Melytta, that the
perfection of Gwydonius, his exquisite qualities, and excellent
vertues haue fiercely assaulted the fort of my
fancie, as I am perforce constrained to resigne my libertie
captiue vnto his curtesie, and to make his person the
prison of my heart. This lucklesse and vnlikely loue madame,
is the cause of my care, &amp; the sum of my sorrowe,
this frantike affection hath driuen my drouping heart to
shew forth these drousy looks, this is it which hath made
me an enimie to my selfe, a foe to all good companie, &amp; to
delight in nothing but sorrow &amp; solitarinesse: yea, this
is the sore, which if in time it be not salued, will preuent
by death all other miseries.
            And is this (quoth Melytta) the paine that so greatly
perplexeth you, is this the 
                  ••
               re which so cōbers thy conscience?
is this the daunger which driues thée into such
deepe distresse? Doest thou thinke so supersti
                  •
               iously of
Gwydonius, or so abiectly of thy selfe, y• thou deemest this

                  〈◊〉
                impossible to be brought to passe: no, no, doubte

not Castania, I my self dare absolutely promise thée, that
thy loue shall sort to such happie successe, as thou thy self
doest séeke for.
            And with that Melytta staied by a sodaine sight shée
had of y• Saint that Castania so hartely serued, for Gwydonius
was entering in at the chamber doore with a dish
of delicates, which Orlanio hearing his Daughter was
sicke, had sent her. Melytta séeing y• 
               Cupid began to fauor
the cause of his clients, in giuing them such fit opportunitie
to discouer their cares wēt her way, leauing Gwydonius
y• first man to play his part in this tragicall Comedie,
who seeing his goddesse thus surprised with sicknesse,
was so galled with griefe, so pinched with hellish
passions, &amp; so tortured with extreame torments, y• his colour
began to change, &amp; he fetcht a deep sigh or two, which
Castania hearing, she perceiued wtout touching his pulses,
the cause of these his sodain passions. In fine, such melancholike
motions so amazed his minde, that he was almost
mute in his message, yet at length incouraging
himselfe, he presented it vnto her in this wise.
            Madame (quoth he) the Duke your Father hearing of
your sodain sicknesse, in token of his fatherly affection, amongst
all his dainties, hath sent you this dish, which he
thinks most méete for your diet, wishing your Ladyship
to let no doubtfull motions distresse your minde, nor no
carefull thoughtes cumber your conscience, for you shall
lacke nothing if you reueale to him your want, which either
your will or wish can desire. And truely madame,
to manifest my willing duetie (if the prayers of a poore
Gentleman may be heard of the heauenly Gods) I wish
that before you tast of this foode, it may turne to Nectar,
whereby not onely your sicknesse should be salued, but
your diuine beautie and vertue according to desert shuld
be crowned with immortalitie.
            
               Castania perceiuing with what seruent affection

               Gwydonius vttered these wordes, began to chéere vp her
selfe, in hope y• her good will should not be repaied with
ingratitude, taking therfore the present at his hands, and
liking it neuer the worse for his sake that brought it, she
returned him this replie.
            
               Gwydonius (quoth she) as I haue cause most reuerently
to accept of my fathers louing curtesie, &amp; to repay his
natural affection with most dutiful obedience, so I haue
cause to thanke thée for thy paines, and to thinke wel of
thée for thy wish, promising in recompence of thy good
will, if in any respect I may plesure thée, to séeke and sue
to my father for preferment.
            Madame, I account the performance of my message
no paine, but pleasure, and I think my selfe as much honoured
by this office, &amp; thrice more happie thē if I shuld
in Ganimedes place present the cup to Iupiter. But Madame,
sith that to stop the streame, is to make the floud
flow more fiercely, to represse the fire, is to make it flame
more furiously, and to restraine the force of loue, is to
kindle a greater flame, least too long delaie shoulde
bréede too great daunger, and by concealing my sorrow I
shuld make the sore incurable, I thought good either presently
to heare the curteous sentence of my lyfe, or the
cruell doome of my death. So it is Madame, that too long
gasing vpon the beames of your heauenly beautie, &amp; to
narrowlye construing ouer your vertuous conditions, I
remaine so caught in the snare of your bounty, &amp; so thralled
in the thridde of your vertue, that the staie of my
life hangeth in your hands, either to driue me downe to
hellish miserie, or to hoist me vp to heauenly felicitye.
For although I haue not héeretofore by duetifull seruice
made manifest the loyaltie of my loue, yet since I first
framed in my fancie (as in a mirrour) the shape of your
surpassing beautie, my heart hath bene crossed with such
cruell Camizados for your sake, as if with the Target

of hope, I had not withstoode the furious force of such raging
furies, I had by dispaire bene dashed against most
dangerous rocks. Sith thē Madam y• sight of your swéet
face hath fast fettered my fancie in the linkes of loue, as
without your meanes I can neither bée redressed nor released:
I humbly desire you neither to resist the motion
of my wel meaning, nor to reiect the deuotion of my good
will, but to accept your poore Gwydonius as a faithfull
seruant.
            
               Castania hearing diligently the faithfull discourse of
distressed Gwydonius, perceiuing by his sighes the pinching
sorrow of his thoughts, and séeing him to fast fettered
in folly, on a sodaine to giue her the slip, had that she desired,
and now her louing lookes was tourned to lowring
glances, her delightfull curtesie, to disdainfull coynesse, &amp;
she thought to repaie the swéet meate wherewith before
she feds him, with most sowre sauce, not that she misliked
of his loue, for it was the onely thing she desired, but to
make him the more feruent in affection, vttering these or
such like words to her selfe secretly.
            And is not Castania the victory most accounted of, wher
the conquest is most doubtful? is not the castle which abideth
the longest battery thought the richest bootie, are not
those pearles which are scarcely found &amp; hardly gotten,
euer of the greatest value, what so is gained by p
                  •
               rill, is
thought alwaies precious, hardly come by, warily kept.
The Maide that by long sute and much trauaile is obtained,
by how much the more she was hard in the winning,
by so much the more she will be swéet in the wearing,
she which in her virginitie is charie of her chastititie,
in her marriage wil be as warie of her honestie, therfore
I will qualifie ye hot loue of Gwydonius with a cold
potion, &amp; with that she made him this waspish answere.
            Why Gwydonius, shal the olde Prouerbe be verified
in thee, that the Priest forgets himselfe that euer he was

a Clearke, that too much 
                  〈◊〉
                bréedes contempt.
I sée well if Appelles that cunning Painter suffer the
greasie Sowter to take a view of his curious worke he
will grow so malapert, as to meddle with his picture:
if the proud Centaure Ixion be bidden to the Feast of
the Gods, no lesse then Iuno her selfe wil suffice him for
his choyce.
            Set a beggar on horse-backe they saye, and he wyll
neuer alyght. Extoll one of base stocke to any degrée of
dignitie, and who so proud and haughtie. I speake this
Gwydonius to thy reproofe: is thy stomacke alate waxen
so queasie, that no diet will downe but my Fathers

with too much furie, he would vnplume thée of all his
feathers, that like Aesops Crowe thou mightst receiue
the reward of thy rashnesse. If therfore thou loue thine
owne welfare keepe thy selfe within thy boundes, and
striue not farther than thy sléeue will stretch, least in
climing too high, thou catch the sorer fall.
            
               Castania hauing thus sharply shaken vp my young
youth Gwydonius, thought she had giuen him a sufficient
cooling Carde: but he no whit dismayed with thys
denial, like a lustie champion entred pece mele with her
in this wise.
            Madame (quoth he) the poore shoomaker was not blamed
for viewing Appelles picture, but because in finding
fault he went beyond his shooe: the Centaure Ixion
was not reprooued for his familiaritie with Iuno as
he was a guest, but in that his sute tended to the sackeing
of her honestie: familiaritie neuer bréedes contempt
in a good mind, neither am I to be accused of y• crime, for
the most seruile slaue in Alexandria (I call the heauens
as witnesses of my wordes) dooth not with more louing
duetie reuerence and honour your person and parentage,
then doth your poore seruaunt Gwydonius. Well
Madam though my nature and nurture be such in your
sight, as they bewray my bringing vp and birth to bée so
base, as if I meane to draw my discent, I must (as you
say) imblaze mine armes in the beggars coate, yet thus
much I aunswere in respect of my parents and without
arrogancie thus farre I stande on my pantuffles, that
the credit I haue in your Fathers Court, is not coequal
with the calling I haue in my owne countrey, if I did
not count it more great credite and honour, in that I
haue sometime inioyed a curteous countenance of your
swéete selfe, since my comming. But if I were the most
famous Prince in the world, I so estéeme your deuine
beautie and exquisite vertue, as I would thinke my self

farre vnworthy to possesse such heauenlye perfection:
which if I could obtaine, the displeasure of your Father
could no whit discourage mée, his thundring threates
could no whit amaze me: no, death it selfe could neuer
daunt my minde, were it neuer so despitefull. But who
(say you) can lay their loue wher is no desert, and wher
want bréeds a flat deniall?
            Ah Castania, Nature by her secret motion, hath indu
               
                  •
               d
all creatures with some perfect qualities, to supplye
that what which bréedes misliking. The Moule depriued
of sight hath a wonderfull hearing, the Hare being
very fearefull is most swifte, the fish hauing no eares,
hath most cléere eyes: so though want of dignitie disgrace
me, though want of coyne discountenaunce me,
though lacke of wealth impaires my credite, yet Nature
hath giuen me such a loyall and louing heart, as I hope
in the perfection of that, she hath supplyed the want of
all the rest: so that Madame though I want coyne I do
not want constancie, though I haue no lands, yet I lack
not loyaltie, though I want wealth, yet I want not wil
to ende my life to doo you good, or spend my time to doo
you seruice.
            
               GWydonius hauing thus pithely replyed, draue Castania
into a great doubt, whether she should presentlye
consent to his demaund, or still driue him off with delayes,
whether she shuld yeelde the fort at the first skirmish,
or stand to the doubtful euent of battaile: at length
least she shuld digresse from the course of womankinde,
she thought best to denie that she most of all desired, and
therefore then gaue him this aunswere.
            
               GWydonius (quoth she) in what state you came to
my Fathers Court I know, what you are by discent
I knowe not, nor I care not, and if I did, it auayl
                  •
               th

not, but this I saye, that it is harde taking of Fowle,
when the net is discryed, and ill catching of Fish, when
the hooke is bare: impossible it is Gwydonius to inferre
beléefe, where no credite will be giuen, and to deceyue
her that spieth thy fetch: when the string is broken, it
is hard to hit the white, and when a mans creditte is
called in question, perswasions can little preuaile. It is
a religion amongst louers to sweare and forsweare, to
promise mountaines and perfourme moulhilles, to bée
ripe without and rotten within, to carrie a rustie blade
in a veluet scabberde, and a siluer Bell with a leaden
clapper. Therefore Gwydonius I had rather mistrust too
soone, than mislyke too late, I had rather feare my choice
than rue my chaunce, I had rather stop at the brimme,
than at the bottome: for the signet being set, it is too
late to breake the bargaine, and fancie being once fixt, it
is too late to reclayme affection. For the loue of a woman
is lyke the Oyle of Flynt, which being once congealed
will neuer be dissolued, like the Diamonde,
which being once rubbed with the gum of a Pine trée,
will neuer be broken: so if I fancie any, sith I meane
not to fléete, it shall bée such a one, as I néede not repent
me.
            And whereas you say Gwydonius, that in despight
of Fortune, Nature hath giuen you a louing heart, I
my selfe surely did neuer déeme any lesse, but thought
you of the crue of those louers that loue too much, hauing
as manie Ladies as they haue wits, and that is
not a fewe, who count that euery face must haue a new
fancie, and if they sée a thousand the
                  •
                must be all viewed with a sigh, which considered Gwydonius, I meane not to like nor to loue neither you nor any other.
            AND shall then Madame (quoth he) my merite be repayed with no 
                  •
               eede, shall my good will be requited  with no gain? shall I  haue in lieu of my loue no liking? will you so swar

                  •
               ustice, as not to giue euerye one according to his desert? at the least recommpence? not desire with despight, and heartie loue with loathing hate, for as the Poet sayeth. Quis enim succenset amanti.
            
            
Well Gwydonius, as I will not be thy priuie friend, so I will not be thine open foe, and as I cannot be so curteous as to requight thee for thy paines, so I wil not be so cruell as to despight thée for thy presumption, and whereas thou crauest gaines for thy good will, I am content to remaine thy vnwilling debter.
            Yet Madame (quoth he) where the debt is confest, ther remaineth some hope of recouerie, for though y• creditor be neuer so vnwilling to pay the debt being due, hée shall by constraint of lawe and his owne confession, (
                  •
               augre his 
                  •
               ace) be forced to make restitution.
            Truth Gwydonius (quoth she) if he commence his action in a right case, &amp; the plea he puts in, proue not imperfect. But yet take this by the way, it is hard for that plaintiffe to recouer his costs, where the defendant bëeing Iudge sets downe the sentence.
            
               Gwydonius feeling himselfe pincht to the quick with this pretie quip made no further reply, but l

to thy friend, whome with bitter blowes thou doost rebuke:
is there no other call for courtesie but crueltie?
doost thou finde no fitter meanes to obtain a reasonable
request but by a rigorous repulse? or is it the nature of
women to defie that outwardly which they most desire
inwardly, to loath that in their mouth, which they loue
in their minde, to reiecte that with their hande, which
they most willingly would receiue in their heart? Doost
thou thinke Castania to drawe Gwydonius to thy desire,
by detesting him? Doost thou thinke to allure him to
thy loue, by loathing him? Doost thou suppose to winne
him to thy will by these waspish aunsweres? No: and
what, doost thou know what perill will insue of this repulse,
what daunger will followe of this denyall? Is it
lyke he will put it vp patiently? No sure, either looke to
haue his extreame loue tourned to extreme hate, or that
he will persist no longer in the pursute of his purpose.
Oh would to God Gwydonius, thou wert againe to begin
thy demaund, and I to frame mine aunswere: then
would I salue thy sores with swéet strops, not with cutting
corasiues: then wold I mittigate thy maladie with
easie medicines, not with pinching playsters: then wold
I comfort thée with consent, not daunt thée with denyalls.
But alas, had I wist now comes too late, &amp; therefore
Castania if thou hast made a fault, séeke to make amends,
and recompence this his iniurie with most friēdly
courtesie.
            And with that came Melitta, who comforting Castania,
passed away the rest of the day in parle.
            
            But Gwydonius, who all this while had a flea in
his eare, was driuen into a quandarie with the taunting
quips of his Mistresse, fearing that although his accompts

were great, his gaines should be little, &amp; though
he made a very long haruest, yet he shoulde reape but a
very small croppe, thinking that vnder such sower spéeches,
a sugred minde could not be contained: yet at last
entring into déeper consideration with himselfe, he fell
into these tearmes.
            But by the swéete (quoth he) how should we know
the sower: but by the blacke how should we know the
white: he neuer greatly accompteth of prosperitie which
hath not bene before pinched with aduersitie: which perchaunce
Castania meanes to make me trye by experyence,
thinking to féede me first with bitter broaths, that
her after daintie fare may more delight me: to daunt
me with the raging stormes of deniall, that the calme
of her consent may more content me: to make mée tast
the bitter pills of annoy, that héerafter I may enioy the
greater ioy: for the chilling cold of Winter makes the
sprowting spring time séeme farre more pleasaunt, the
parching heate of Summer, makes the coole shade more
delightfull, and the frowning lookes of Castania, will
make her smiling countenaunce séeme more chéerefull.
Then cease not Gwydonius to pursue thy sute with endlesse
paine, either to enioy her curtesie, or tast of her crueltie,
to thy great happinesse or extreme heauinesse.
            
               GWydonius thus like a valiant champion, neuer amazed
with any chip of misfortune, neuer feared to giue
the assault for all the first repulse, but onely sought opportunitie
how he might in close combat once again incounter
with Castania, vowing either to return wt some
signe of victorie, or els to put lim and life in hazard. But
fortune meaning plesantly to sport wt this yoūg nouice,
wold neuer minister such fit occasiō, y• he might haue solitary
accesse to his goddes, for Castania of pretēded purpose

so warely auoided his companie, and with such disdainfull
lookes so reiected his dutie, as Gwydonius was
constrained to séeke his course, by a new compasse, delyuering
vnto one of her maides a friendly letter to this
effect.
            
               
                  Disdayned Gwydonius to his desired
Castania, Health.
                  WHo so tasteth (Madame Castania) of the Riuer Licos
in India, féeleth such a continuall flame to fry
and fret his intrayles, as it is more torture than to bée
tormented with the hellish-furies, and this griefe canne
neuer be redressed, but with drinking the bloud of his
déerest friend. And as he that is venomed by the Phalanga,
féeleth such painfull passions, as he runneth mad,
and is onely cured by the meanes of most harmonious
musicke: so Madame, the furious heate of fancie, dooth
so scorch and scale my haplesse heart, and dooth perplexe
me with such hellish pangues, as death it selfe were
thrice more desired, than thus to driue my dayes in dolour.
And I haue so gréedely swallowed vp the sugred
poyson of your deuine beautie, as through the extremitie
of pinching griefe, which so direfully distresseth me,
I rest as one distract from his senses, not possible to obtaine
a cure for this my calamitie, vnles with the deaw
of mutuall affection you mitigate my maladie, or with
the pleasant harmonie of your musical consent, you appease
my miserie.
                  Sith then Madam my care procéedeth from your beautie,
let my sore be cured by your bountie, sith the perfection
of your person hath wrought my bane, let the effect
of your courtesie procure my blisse, and reiect him not

The pike fatally prosecuteth the fish Mugra, as his mortall

spéedely shreddeth the line in sunder, to deliuer him, the
Snake most deadly detesteth the field-mouse, and yet she
heapeth vp in her hole store of prouision to preuent her
enimies penurie: and shall then madame, your crueltie
so farre excéede these sencelesse creatures? shall your
rigour be so voide of reason, as to requite your friende
with paine? when they repaie their foes with pleasure,
to driue your friends into distresse, when they redéeme
their foes from daunger, no madame, I hope you wil not
counteruaile my constancie with such discurtesie, nor so
recklesly regard your poore Gwydonius, whose loue and
loyaltie is so great, that as the stones which are found
in the riuer Lyncestis, the lowder the winde bloweth, &amp;
the deeper they are drencht in the water, the more they
burne and blaze: so the more you séeke to coole my fancie
with disdaine, the more my affection is kindled with
desire, the more you loath, the more I like: the greater
dispaire you driue me into by denialls, the greater hope,
(incouraged by constancie) I haue to obtaine my request,
in which feruent affection, I meane to remayne
without chaunge, crauing in liewe of this my loyaltie,
that you will spéedely send the messenger of present consolation,
to him which pineth awaie, and is yours onely,
and euer.
                  
                     Still in hope, Gwydonius.
                  
               
            
            
               CAstania hauing receiued this Letter from her assured
friend Gwydonius, although she perceiued by the contents

that his loue was not counterfait, but constant: not
lyght, but loyall: not floting, but faithfull: and that she
should not finde him immutable in prosperitie, which
was so permanent in aduersitie. Yet (whether it were
for coynesse in consent, or charinesse of choise I knowe
not) she once againe thought to sound him more deeper,
to kéepe out still the flagge of defiaunce, and to spende
one Uollée of shot in the face of her enimie, to sée if a hot
skirmish would make him flie the field. And if lyke a
valiaunt souldier he did manfully march on, and not refuse
the brunt of the battaile, shée woulde then resigne
the fort of her fréedome into his hands, and yéelde vp the
bulwarke of her breast, which so long he had battered,
that triumphauntly he might set vp Trophees in signe
of a most victorious conquest. To put therefore the matter
in question, she returned him this answere.
            
               
                  Castania to Gwydonius which hopeth
in vaine, health.
                  MAister Gwydonius, your Letter béeing more hastely
receiued then heartely read, I perceiue by the contents,
that you are still perplexed with your pensicke passions,
and that your disease is incurable, for if your pains
may be appeased, or your maladie mittigated by no medicine,
but by my meanes, you are like either to pay your
due vnto death, or still to linger in distresse. My cunning
is too small to enterprise the composition of anye secrete
simples, and my calling too great to become a Phisition
to such a paltering pacient, so that I neither can nor wil
cure another mannes harme by mine owne mishap. To
loue him whome I cannot like, were but to wreast against
mine owne will, to flatter him whome I meane

not to fancie, is but a méere tricke of extreame follye.
What the cause is Gwydonius, that thy good will reapes
so small gaine, and that so rigorously I repaie thy loue
with hate, I knowe not, vnlesse the constellation of the
Starres by some secrete influence haue so appointed it
in the calculation of our natiuitie. But this I am sure,
that as no Serpent can abide the smell of a harts horne,
as the Panther escheweth the companie of the Ownce,
as the Uulture is mortall enimie to y• E
                        •
                     le, and as it is
impossible to hatch vp a Swanne in an Eagles neast, to
temper Oile &amp; Pitch together in one vessell, to mixe the
bloud of a Lyon and a Woolfe in one bowle, and to procure
amitie betwéene the Fawlcon called Tilo, and the
Foxe, so hard is it to procure me by ruthfull request to be
thy friend, which am by instinct of nature thy protested
foe, and as harde to winne me to thy wife, who so little
likes of thy loue, that the verie remembrance of thy person
makes me fal into most hatefull passions. Cease thē
                     Gwydonius to condempne me of crueltie, and leaue off at
last to appeale to my curtesie, for thou shalt alwayes bée
sure to feele the one, &amp; neuer to finde the other. Yet least
thou shouldest accuse me of ingratitude, though I cannot
inwardly mittigate thy miserie, yet I will outwardlye
teach thée to applie such plaisters (as if the experience of
them proue true) shall greatly appease thy paine. Plinie
Gwydonius reporteth, that hée which drinketh of the riuer
Auerna, cooleth and mortifieth his affections, but if
the water be toucht by any meanes before it be drunke,
the vertue thereof is of no value. He that weareth the
feathers of the Birde Ezalon about him, shall euer bée
fortunate in his loue, but if they bée not pulde when
the Sunne is eclipsed, they are of no force: and to conclude,
ther is nothing that sooner driueth awaie amorous
conceits, thē to rub y• temples of thy head with ye sweat of

an Asse, which if you canne performe it, as no doubt you
may put it in practise, I hope you shall be redressed from
your intollerable griefe, and I released from such an importunate
sute.
                  
                     Forced by the destinies still to denie thee, Castania.
                  
               
            
            
               Gwydonius hauing viewed and reuiewed ouer this
Letter, seeing y• rigorous resolution of his mistres, could
by no meanes be remoued, and that a most seuere sentence
was pronounced against him by a most iniurious
Iudge, was driuen into a doubt whether he should styll
with plaints sue for pittie, or else blasphemously exclaim
against her brutish crueltie, whether he should bewraie
his parents and parentage to the Duke and her, or still
stand to the doubtfull chaunce of Fortune, to pursue his
purpose still with plaints, her hellish crueltie perswaded
him: to blaspheme against her, the sinceritie of his lou
                  •
               
would not let him: to bewraie his birth, diuerse daungers
might insue: to stand to the chaunce of Fortune,
was still to hazard without hope: combred thus with diuers
cogitations, at last he determined to breake vp the
batterie, and to laie too an 
                  〈◊〉
                hold, but to returne
with as much speede as might be to his father Clerophontes
Court, there by absence to mittigate the maladie
which so grieuously molested him: yet he thought before
his departure to giue her a friendly farewell, that
might both confirme his constancie, and condempne her
crueltie, which he framed to this effect.

what curtesie shall I euer be able to shew thée, that may

to requite thy loyaltie? what duetie can be a due recompence
to this thy good will: yea, if I by any meanes canne
quit this thy loue, I neuer doubt to bée déemed ingratefull
while I liue: Thy worthy constancie (Gwydonius)
hath wonne the castle which many haue besieged, &amp; thou
hast obtained yt which diuerse haue sought to gaine: yet
it is not the shape of thy beautie, but the hope of thy loialtie
which entiseth me, not thy faire face, but thy faithfull
heart: not thy comely countenaunce, but thy modest
curtesie, not thy words, but thy vertues: not thy wealth,
but thy wit: for she that builds her fancie vpon such fading
subiects, tieth her loue to the inconstant whéele of
fortune. And what though the Duke my father be incensed
against me, for making (in his minde) so carelesse a
choice? What care I for his friendship, so I haue thy fauour,
let him fret, let my friends frowne, let liuinges be

            THis Letter being most luckelye deliuered into the
hands of Gwydonius, I leaue you to iudge Gentlemē
into what a quādarie this yoūg youth was brought
to see such a sodaine chaunge, and so happie a chaunce,
as to haue his hellish bale requited with heauēly blisse,
his despightfull annoy, with delightfull ioye: his heauinesse
with happinesse, and doubtfull despaire tourned
to assured hope: to sée Fortune which of late defied him
as a foe, now to imbrace him as a friend, and to will
that he did wish: to sée his mistres crueltie tourned to
curtesie, her disdaine to desire, her bitter pilles to sugured
potions, her stormie repulses to calme consent, and
her contemptuous protestations, to most constant promises.
For if the carefull captiue, who by the doome of
the Iudge expecteth each hower to die, reioyceth when he
heareth his pardon pronoūced, no doubt Gwydonius ioye
could be no losse, sith deniall was his death, and consent
the conserue to heale his wounds: the greater care, the
greater ioye, the more paine the greater pleasure, the
more hellish miserie the more heauenly felicitie. Yea,
Gwydonius was driuen into such an extasie for ioy, that
he was in doubt, whether this letter was preferred to

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉

him in déede, or presented to him in a Uision,
whether hée were wrapte into a Traunce, or rauished
with some drowsie slumber: but at last perceiuing
it to be no fained fantasie, such a déep desire inforced
his affection, as he thought euery moment a month,
euery houre a yeare, euerye daye a thousande, vntill hée
might fréely enioy the presence and sight of his loue and
Ladie Castania. Fortune meaning to aduaunce him to
the toppe of her inconstant whéele, brought it so to passe,
that before the wéeke was ended, he spied Castania walking
alone in the garden: which sodaine sight so reuiued
his sences, ye without anye dread or doubt he manfully
marcht on towards her, and was as hastely &amp; hartely
incountred by Castania: who embracing Gwydonius
in her armes, welcommed him with this salutation.
            AS the Whale (Gwydonius) maketh alwayes signe
of great ioye at the sight of the fish called Talpa Marina,
as the Hynde greatlye delyghteth to sée the Leoparde,
as the Lion fawneth at the viewe of the Unicorne,
and as he which drinketh of the Fountaine Hypenis
in Scithia, féeleth his mind so drowned in delight,
that no greefe though neuer so great, is able to asswage
it: so Gwydonius I conceiue such surpassing pleasure
in thy presence, and such heauenlye felicitie in the sight
of thy perfection, that no miserie though neuer so monstrous
is able to amaze me, no dolour though neuer so
direfull is able to daunt me, nor no mishap though neuer
so perillous, is able to make me sinke in sorrow, as
long as I inioy thy presence, which I count a soueraine
preseruatiue against all carefull calamities. That as he
which tasteth of the hearbe Hyacynthus is neuer combred
with care, and as he that weareth the stone Agathes
about him, is surely defenced against all insuing
sorrrowes, so inioying the sight of thy séemely selfe, and

féeding mine eyes with the forme of thy feature, I think
my selfe sufficiently shrowded against all the tempestuous
showers of sinister fortune. And to proue these my
promises to be no fained vanities but faithfull veritie,
I commit my selfe, my stay, and state into thy hands to
dispose of me at thy plesure, wishing rather to liue with
thée in most distressed penurie, than to linger héere in
most fortunate prosperitie.
            
               GWydonius listening attentiuely to this sugred harmonie,
was so rauished with the sight of her sweete
face, and so rapt into a traunce with the contemplation
of her beautie, that as the Lyon tasting of the gumme
Arabicke becommeth senselesse, as the Bul by browsing
on the barke of a Iuniper trée falleth a sléepe, as the Camill
standeth astonished at the sight of a Rat: so Gwydonius
séeing in his armes the Saint whom in heart hée
did honour, and imbracing the Goddesse whome with
most déepe deuotion hée did adore, was so amazed, that
he was not able to vtter one worde as witnesse of his
happinesse, vntill at last gathering his wits together, he
beganne thus to reply.
            
               CAstania (quoth hée) it is an axiome in Philosophie,
that the colour ioyned hard to the sight, hindereth the
sence, the flower put into the nosethrill stoppeth the
smelling, the Wine vessell béeing full, lets passe no wine
though neuer so well vented, the water-pot béeing filled
to the brimme, yeeldes forth no licour, though hauing
a thousand holes: so where the minde is surcharged with
ouermuch ioy, or too much pleasure, there the tongue is
both tied, and the sences so restrained, that the heart is
neither able to conceiue the ioye, nor the tongue able to
expresse the pleasure. Which Castania I nowe

speake by proofe, and knowe by experience, for I am so
drowned in delight by inioying that princely Iemme,
which I estéeme the rarest and richest Iewell, not onely
in Alexandria, but in all the worlde, and so puffed vp
in pleasure by thy diuine presence. Yea, thy faithfull
and vnfained affection, the promise of thy constancie, and
the hope of thy loyaltie, the report of thy chastitie, &amp; the
renowme of thy modestie, the force of thy beautie, &amp; the
fame of thy vertue. But aboue all thy prodigall bountie,
in bestowing these heauenlye perfections on thy
poore Gwydonius, béeing by person and parentage most
vnworthy to possesse them, so surcharg
                  •
               th my silly heart
with excessiue ioye, that my tongue not being able in
part to expresse the extreame pleasure of my minde, I
am with Phili
                     •
                  tion the Comicall Poet, constrayned by
silence to vnfolde that affection, which in words the filed
phrase of Demosthenes were not able to decypher. But
this assure thy selfe Castania, that if Iuno wold aduance
me to be Monarch of the world, if Pallas would preferre
me to excéede hautie Hercules in valour, if Venus wold
present me with some princely péece of heuenly perfection,
yet would I not so gladly receiue their proffers, as
I doo gratefully accept the promise of thy loue and loyaltie.
No, I accompt the treasure of Croesus but trash, in
respect of the guerdon of thy good will: I accompt the
fortune of Caesar but folly, respecting the fruites of thy
fauour: I estéeme the dignities of Priamus as dregs,
in respect of thy diuine perfection. Yea Castania, I am
so snared with thy beautie, and so intangled in the trap
of thy bountie, as I shall neuer leaue to loue thée, nor euer
beginne to like any other.
            IT is easie Gwydonius (quoth Castania) to purchase
credite, where the partie is alreadie perswaded, and
to infer beléefe, where euery word is counted an Oracle.

Therefore omitting these friuolous protestations, thus
much I say touching the purpose. Cecillius Metellus was
wont to say, that as it was necessary that old men shuld
be graue in counsaile, so it was expedient young men
should be secret in loue, and therefore when the contract
was made betwéene Fuluius and his daughter, he sealed
vp their lippes with his signet, meaning that to violate
the secret conference of louers, was to commit a second
sacriledge. I speake this Gwydonius, as one carefull of
thy staye and my state: for if Orlanio my father should
but once heare of our loue, or suspect our liking, it wold
bréede thy mishap and my miserie: yea, no doubt hée
would spéedely preuent our pretence, which woulde bée
thy care and my calamitie. Dispose our affaires at thy
pleasure, but discouer not our purpose, if thou hast won
the castell vaunt not of the conquest, if thou hast made
a good market, bragge not of thy gaines, lest by boasting
of thy bootie, thou loose thy pray and be thought a pratler.
And Gwydonius aboue all men beware of Valericus,
least vnder the shape of a friend, he proue in tyme
thy mortall foe, least his fained amitie proue faithlesse
enmitie: that in trusting too much without triall, thou
finde not treason: and then though thou repent, yet had
I wist cometh too late, &amp; so thou wish thou hadst neuer
loued, and I neuer liked.
            TUsh Castania (quoth Gwydonius) he that is afraide
to venter on the Bucke because he is tapisht in the
briers, shall neuer haue hunters happe, and he that puts
his doubt in loue for euery chaunce, shal neuer haue louers
lucke. Cannot the Cat catch Mice, without she
haue a bell hanged at her eare? Cannot the Hobbie seaze
on his praye but he must checke? Cannot the Spaniell
retryue the Partridge, but he must quest? and cannot
we deale so warely but all the worlde must wonder at

it? Yes, it is a subtill birde that bréedes among ye aerin
of Hawkes, and a shifting Shéepe that Lambes in the
Foxes Denne, and he shall looke narrowlye, that spyes
me halting. Let Orlanio not onely weigh our workes,
but our wordes, and let Valericus both déeme our déeds,
and deuine our thoughts, and yet I hope we will deale
so secretlye in our affaires, as neither the one shal haue
cause to suspect our familiaritie, nor the other to detect
our affection. And therefore Castania least (if we bée
spyed) the time and place giue occasiou of mistrust, I
will leaue you as I found you, and so farewell.
            WEll these two louers placed thus by fortune in the
Pallaice of earthlye prosperitie, floated so securelye
in the streames of blisse, as they thought no chips
of mischaunce might chaunge their present happinesse
to future heauines, as long as their priuie contract was
kept so secret to themselues. But as they which cannot
sée fire in the strawe are stone blinde: so he that cannot
sée the flame of fancie is a foole. It is harde to couer
smoake, but more harde to conceale loue, which these
two Louers in tract of time tryed true. Who as closely
as they kept their cloake, yet it was most easie to espie
the lining: for fancie secretly restrayned, is like the
sparke couered with ashes, which at length bursteth into
a great flame. For there passed betwéene Gwydonius
such amorous glaunces, such louing lookes, such courteous
congies, such countenaunces, and such friendlye
familiaritie, such often méetings, such open gréetings,
such sighes, such sobbes, and such straunge passions, as
not onely Valericus but all the Courte (though they
poore soules, thought to daunce in a Nette and not bée
séene) perceiued how entirelye they loued, and lyked

               
                  •
               ach other. Which as it did not displease many which
loued Gwydonius as their friend, so it greatly despited
Valericus which was his foe, to see one of small countenaunce
preferred before one of his callyng, that Gwydonius
shoulde winne the Bulwarke which he so long
had battered: that hée pitching the Field, another shuld
obtaine the Conquest: that hée laying the siege, another
shoulde vaunt of the victorye: that while he beat
the Bush, another shoulde catche the Birdes: and that
the méede of his merite, should be giuen to one of small
deserte. Béeing combred with these cholaricke cogitations,
and perplexed with these despightfull passions,
inflamed with wrathfull furie, he fell into these termes.
            O Goddes (quoth hée) what courtesie is there to bée
founde in such Kytes of Croesus kinde, or what
constancie is there to bée hoped for, in suche dayntye
disdayning Dames? whose wauering wills and staylesse
wittes both waxe and wane with the Moone,
whose Lunaticke mindes chaunge with euerye suddayne
motion; yea, whose lyghtnesse and leawdnesse
is suche, as they delyght with the Rauen to feede on
the moste loathsome fleshe, with the shée Woolfe to
choose the fowlest Make, with Aesops Cocke to preferre
the barley Corne before a most precious pearle, &amp;
with Glaucus to make a chaunge of his golden armour
for brazen harnesse.
            Didde not Euphinia forsake most famous
Princes, and imbrace a most infamous Bondeslaue?
Didde not Sirichia the Princesse of Denmarke
reiecte moste Princelye Potentates, and at
laste accepte a poore Peasaunt? Yea, didde not

               Venus her selfe with the béetle, disdain all day to light
on the most fragrant flowers, and at night vouchsafeth
to lodge in a filthie cowsheard: I meane, did shée not
refuse the renowmed Gods, and choose a most deformed
Smith.
            Why, but Valericus, is it fancie that forceth them to
this folly? Doth loue lead them? doo the Destenies driue
them? doth beautie allure them? Is it their countenance
that constraineth them? no, they are clownes: is it their
person or parentage that perswadeth them: no, they are
pesants. But like craftie Calipsos they thinke by these
vnequall matches to rule the roste after their owne dyet,
to be soueraigne Mistres of their owne mindes, with
Venus to let Vulcan possesse the trée, and Mars enioye
the fruite, to haue their husbands féede the shéepe, &amp; some
other reape the fléece: vnder the shaddowe of his heade,
doo defende themselues from such heate, as would otherwise
greatly scorch their credite, to make him followe
the bent of their bowe, although he set the Cuckoldes
end vpward. It is a simple cloake that cannot couer one
from a shower of raine, and a silly husband that is not
able to father that another dooth beget. But to see howe
these gallaunt girles, if they like not the partie, what
shewe of shamefastnesse they will make, how they will
vale their face with the visour of virginitie, howe they
will cloake themselues with the colour of continencie,
how charie they will be of their chastitie: whereas if
they fancie, who so loose of their lips, and frée of theyr
flesh as they. But Valericus, why doost thou thus reckelessely
raile and rage against womankinde. It is not
Castania that thus crosseth thée with care, but Gwydonius
that bréedeth thy griefe. It is not shée that inferreth
thy sore, but hée that procureth thy sicknesse.
            Shée is not the meanes of thy maladye, but
hée the hinderer of thy medicine. Shée is not the

worker of thy woe, but he is the sower of thy sorrowe.
And shall hée bée puffed vp with prosperitie, and I pressed
downe with miserie? shall he swimme in wealth,
and I sinke in want? shall he bath in blisse, and I waile
in woe? shall he bée pampered vp with pleasure, and I
pinde awaie with penurie? No, I will either spoile him,
or spill my selfe, in despight of the fates and fortune.
            WHile thus Valericus sought opportunitie to reuenge
his wrath vppon guiltlesse Gwydonius, Fortune
minding to bewraie her immutabilitie, brought it so to
passe, that whereas Orlanio was accustomed to paie a
yéerely tribute to the duke of Metelyne, which surmounted
to the sum of thirtie thousand Duckets, either wilfully
or vnwittingly he with-held this debt, which Clerophontes
claimed as his due, insomuch that béeing demanded
by Embassage for ye paiment of this tribute, hée
flatly answered, that he would not from hence foorth disburse
one denier, &amp; he was sorrie that in paying it héeretofore
he proued himselfe such a foole. Wherevpon Clerophontes
being fraught with raging fury, was so incensed
against Orlanio, that taking counsaile of his nobilytie,
he determined with as much spéede as might bée, to
wage battaile against him, and to obtaine that by constraint,
which he denyed him of curtesie. As thus he was
musing with himselfe whom he shuld appoint Captaine
generall of his armie, because he meant not in proper
person to abide the hazarde of the battaile, the rem
                  •
               mbraunce
of his sonne Gwydonius, came into his minde,
which not onely amazed him, but so molested him, as hée
was driuen into most distressed dolour, now he called to
minde his mercilesse crueltie in correcting his faults, and
his moodlesse rigour in rebuking his folly: 
                  •
               owe he bewailed
his long absence, and wished his spéedie presence:
yea, he was so diuersly perplexed, as he began thus dolorously

to discourse with himselfe.
            ALasse (quoth he) now I sée the saying of Cicero to be
true, that who so wilfullye peruerteth the lawes of
nature, séemeth to proclaime himselfe an enimie to the
Gods: for that Nature neuer framed anye thing amisse,
wherein I haue most grieuously offended: For in
beastly rage I haue surpassed the brute beasts, and in
crueltie the sencelesse creatures: I haue béene more
deuoyde of pittie then the fowles of the aire, and more
vnnaturall then the Fishes of the Sea. The Birde
called Apis Indica, séeing the venimous Uiper readie to
deuour her young ones in the neast, presenteth her selfe
to death, to preserue them from destruction. The Eagle
is so carefull ouer her young, that if it happe by her default
one of them doe perish, shée willinglye woundeth
her selfe in many places with her owne beake. The Lyon
so louingly fostereth vp her Whelpes, that shée neuer
tasteth of the praie vntyll they bée fullye satisfied.
The Foxe is so carefull ouer her cubbes, that shée willingly
falleth into the Hunters handes to defende hir
young from harme. But I vilde wretch, (as though I
had drunke of the Ryuer Lincestis in Bohemia, which
presently tourneth whatsoeuer it toucheth into stones.
In stéede of friendly courtesie, haue abused mine owne
sonne with frowning crueltie, in liew of mercie I haue
brought him to miserie, the fatherlye affection I haue
shewed him, hath béene raging furie: yea, my rygorous
Nature, naye rather my vnnaturall rage hath béene
such towardes him, as hée lyueth a bannished exile in a
straunge Countrey, perhappes pinched wyth penurye,
oppressed with pouertie, wandering in the wilde Desartes,
in daunger of deuouring, in peryll of spoyling,
afflicted not onelye with the maladie of the bodie, but
the miserie of the minde: so that no doubte hée wisheth

that I had neuer béene Father to such a sonne, or he neuer
sonne to such a Father.
            Alasse what ioye canne I nowe enioy, when I want
my onely ioye? What comfort canne I haue to sée my
childe in calamitie? What pleasure canne I take while
hée toyleth in penurie, who nowe in mine age shoulde
bée the staffe whereon to staie, that by his valyaunt courage
and warlike prowesse (wherewith from his infancie
hée hath béene indewed) might defend mee from
mine enimies, and reuenge mée of my foes. But alasse
I lament too late, the calme commeth out of time, when
the Shippe alreadie hath suffered shipwracke, and these
pittifull plaintes little preuaile, where the patient is
alreadie pushed into perill. No, no, my rage hath béene
too greate, to heare of his hastie retourne, my peruerse
furie hath béene such, as hée dare not abide my presence:
and surely my sorrowe is too greate euer to bée
salued.
            And with that Clerophontes start vp, minding to
reuenge these his cholarike cogitations by bloudie battaile,
vppon the confines of Alexandria, and therefore
in greate hast mustered all his men, made great prouisions
for the warre, and caused his Nauie to bée rigged, for
that hée meant to conueie his armie by sea into Alexandria.
            
            While thus there was no worde through the whole
Dukedome of Meteline but warre, warre, and no newes
but of the cruell conflicte that shoulde insue betwéene
the two Dukes. Certaine Merchauntes of Alexandria,
which then roade in the Hauen, durst not goe a shoare
to sell their commodities, but as fast as Winde and
weather would serue them, highed them out of the harbour,
and coasted spéedely into their owne countrie: wher
they no sooner arriued, but they made reporte thereof
to Orlanio, who driuen into a dumpe wyth this

noysome newes, whether he doubted of the puissant power
of Clerophontes, who was such a worthie warriour,
and in battaile so bolde, that no man durst abide him, or
whether he feared his owne force was not able to resist
the furie of his raging enimie. He presently summoned
all his Lordes to a Parliament, where after some conference,
it was concluded, that Thersandro should bée sent
Embassadour to Metelyne to parle of peace with Clerophontes,
which determination was no whit deferred, but
with as much spéede as might be, the barke wherein he
should passe was prouided, the charge of the Embassage
was giuen him, &amp; he accompanied with a traine of braue
Gentlemen, departed.
            But if this newes was dolefull to Orlanio, no doubt
it was death it selfe to Gwidonius, who hearing that his
Father would bend his force against the place, wherein
he was. Sawe all possibilitie taken awaie from obtayning
his purpose. For he feared death if he were knowen
to Orlanio, and he doubted despightfull hate at the
least if he bewraide himselfe to Castania. Which double
dolour so distressed him, as he felte himselfe diuersly perplexed
with dumpish passions, his mirth was tourned to
mourning, his pleasaunt conceits, to painefull cogitations:
his wanton toyes, to wailing thoughtes, now he abondoned
all good companie, and delighted onely in solytarie
life, the wilesome woodes were his wished walkes,
and the secret shades the couert he chiefly coueted. In
fine, he séemed rather a Tymon of Athens, then a Gentleman
of Alexandria, so that all the Court meruailed at
this so sodaine a chaunge: but especially Castania, who
cōiecturing his doleful hart by his drousy looks, was astonished
at this his strange state, casting in her mind whether
she had giuen him any cause of this care, or whether
by her occasion he was crossed with this calamitie. But
alas poore soule, howsoeuer she aimed she mist ye marke,

for Gwydonius felte his disease so secrete, as hée knewe
none could but himselfe deuine the cause of his maladie,
which no doubt was such, that it woulde haue inferred
present death, if he had not hoped for some happie newes
by Thersandro.
            
            Who no sooner luckely ariued at Metelyne, but Clerophontes
was certified, that the Dukes son of Alexandria
was come to impart with his grace some waightie matters
of importaunce. Nowe at this instaunt when the
message was brought him, his Daughter Lewcippa
was by, who (as the Nature of women is, desirous to sée
and bee séene) thought she woulde both heare the parle,
and viewe the person of this young Embassadour, and
therefore found fish on her fingers, that she might staye
still in the chamber of presence, whether presently Thersandro
was sent for, who curteously and curiously dooing
his obysaunce to the Duke, deliuered his Embassage in
this manner.

                rather
to wage battaile, then to loose anie parte of your due although
he feareth not your force, as one able euery way
to withstand it, nor passeth of your puissaunce, as a Potentate
sufficient to resist your power. Yet, the care hée
hath of his subiectes safetie, and the loue hee hath to preserue
the life of his commons, the regard he hath to paie
and performe that which conscience and custome requireth,
and lastly, meaning with Tully, Iniquissimam pacem
iustissimo bello anteponere. Hée hath sent mée
both to sue for conditions of peace, and to pay the tribute,
which if your grace shall refuse, of force he must put his

hope in the hazard of Fortune.
            
               THersandro hauing thus pythelye performed his
charge, Clerophontes tolde him that vpon a sodaine
he woulde not dispatche so waightie a matter, but
meant first both to consulte and take counsaile of his
Nobles: which done, within thrée dayes hée shoulde
haue an aunswere. In the meane time hée commaunded
Lucianus the Steward of his house, verie courteouslye
to intreate both Thersandro and his traine, and to
feast them with such sumptuous fare, as they might haue
cause most highly to extoll his magnificence.
            But leauing Clerophontes to consult with his learned
counsaylours, and Thersandro to companie with the
lustie Courtiers, againe to Lewcippa, who while this
young youth was telling of his 
                  •
               ale, neuer markte the
matter, but the man, nor regarded not the parle, but respected
the person: neuer noted the contents, but viewed
his countenance: In such sort, that shée was so scorched
with the fire of fancie, and so scalded with the flame
of affection, so bewitched with his beautie, and so inueagled
with his bountie, as hée was the onelye man that
made her checke at the praie, bate at the Lure, and wyllingly
yéelde to the first assaulte of fancie. And on the
other side, Fortune so fauoured, that Thersandro printing
in his heart the perfection of Lewcippas person,
felte his fréedome so fettered by the viewe of her heauenly
face, and so snared in the beames of her amorous
glaunces, that hée wisht that eyther this discention had
neuer growen, or that hée hadde not béene the deliuerer
of the message, for hee felt his heart alreadie so ouergrowen
wyth good-will towardes this younge Princesse,
as no salue but her selfe was able to mittigate his
sorrowe, no medicine but her courte
                  ••
               e was able to cure

his calamitie, and hée thought to preferre his sute to his
professed foe, was follie: to linger still in loue, was death
and miserie: to séeke for helpe at her handes, neyther
woulde the present state permitte him, nor time suffer
him to prosecute his purpose: daunted with these diuerse
doubtes to auoyde the melancholike motions that molested
his minde, hée presently went from his lodging to
the Court, that by companie he might driue awaie these
dumpes, where hée found in the great chamber diuerse
Ladies and Gentlemen, passing awaie the time in pleasaunt
parle, amongst whom was that pearelesse Paragon,
princely Lewcippa: who (after due reuerence done
to the Gentlewomen in generall) was singled out by
Thersandro, and courted in this wise.
            MAdame (quoth hée) if anie creature hath iust occasio
                  •
               
to accuse either Nature or the Gods of iniustice,
man onelye hath the greatest cause to make this complaint,
for there is none eyther so depriued of reason, or
deuoide of sence, which by some naturall instinct dooeth
not skilfully presage of perills before they come, and warily
preuent ere they be past.
            The Goates of Lybia knowe certainelye when the
Canicular dayes beginne, wherein commonlye they fall
blinde, and therefore by eating the hearbe

they prouidentlye preuent their disease. When the Lyon
leaueth his Lawnes, and raungeth in forraine Desertes,
hée alwayes foresheweth a drought. When the
Fish called V

                  anascapos sinketh downe to the bottome
of the Sea, hée bewrayeth greate tempestes to
bée imminent. But man is so farre from this secrete
foresight, that not onelye hée cannot deuine of
these ensuinge daungers, but rather wilfullye

or willing, pusheth himselfe into most manifest perills,
which madame, I speake, as féeling my selfe distressed
with this want. For if I had bene indued with this sacred
prescience, perfectly to presage of ensuing perilles, I
had not ben crossed with such cares as I am like to incur,
nor hadde cause to repent this my present arriuall. But
sith lacke of such skill hath procured my losse, and that
when the hurt is had it is too late to take héede, though
reuealing of my mishappe cannot heale my miserie, nor
repeating of my paines redresse my sorrowe: yet, I
meane to participate my passions to your good grace,
that though you cannot or will not mittigate my maladie,
yet you maye pittie my estate, which will somewhat
ease my heauinesse. I came to your Fathers
Court madame, a frée man of Alexandria, and am lyke
to retourne a captiue of Metelyne, I arriued deuoyde of
care, and am lyke to departe, drenched with calamitie:
I landed frée from affection, but feare to passe hence
fraught with fancie: my charge was onely to parle of
peace, but my chaunce is to discourse of passions. Yea,
your beautie hath so fettered my fréedome, and so snared
my heart in the linkes of your loue, that it shall neuer
bée raced out by anye sinister meanes of Fortune,
although I sée it is almost impossible to obtayne
it.
            For I doubte our parents are lyke to proclaym
                  •
               
themselues professed foes, and the vrgent necessitie of
my affayres, forceth mée to departe so spéedelye, as
want of time wyll not suffice to make tryall of my
loue, whereby I might claime a sufficient guerdon
for my good wyll: yet howsoeuer the matter shall
happe, whether my hope be voide, or my happe be vaine,
I meane madame to remaine yours for euer.
            
               
               Lewcippa tooke such delight in hearing Thersandro
discourse so louingly, as she could scarely kéepe her countenaunce
from bewraying the pleasure she conceiued in
this parle, séeing that her loue was requited with lyking,
and her fancie incountered with the like affection.
Yet least Thersandro should thinke her too curteous
if she shuld come at the first call, and very light of loue,
to like at the first looke, she framed him this aunswere.
            SIr (quoth she) if of your sute for conditions of
peace there insue no better successe than the reuealing
of your passions shall reape pittie at my handes, or
if the intreatie for truce be as lightly respected by my
Father, as either your person or petition is regarded by
me, you are like to carrie home cold newes to your coū
               trey,
and to vaunt that you bad faire, but bought little:
that your Haruest was long, but your corne not worth
the cropping: that your venter was much, but your
gaines such, as if your winnings proue no better, you
are lyke to liue by the losse. For sir, doo you suppose mée
so sottish, as to thinke euery one that flatters dooth fancie,
or so addicted to selfe loue, as by a few filed phrases
to be brought into a fooles Paradice: knowing that it
is the fashion of men by their fained subtiltie to deceiue
our faithfull simplicitie. No, for if you meane to counterfaite,
take this for a rule, it is ill halting before a creple.
But sir, this your sodaine liking bewrayes y• lightnesse
of your loue, this your fonde affection, imports the
ficklenesse of your fancie: for soone hot, soone cold? easely
inflamed, as quickly quenched: like to the Apples of Arabia,
which begin to rot, ere they be halfe ripe. And if I
meant to loue, had I none to like but my Fathers foe?
should I desire him whom my Father dooth detest? And
if I should so farre forget mine owne staye, or my Fathers

state, as to consent, it were impossible either to
appease his wrath, or to get y• graunt of his good will, so
yt to desire y• which I can neuer inioy, wer to driue my
self wholy into despair, which wold smally profit you,
and greatlye displeasure me, and therefore cease to sue
for that, which may

               e wisht, but neuer obtaiued.
            
               Thersandro although he heard Lewcippa decide the
case sufficiently, yet he was so wilfull, that he woulde
not take her doome for a verdite, but retourned her this
replye.
            MAdame (quoth he) where in liew of hate there insueth
loue, it is alwayes the signe of the greater
affection: and that it is a thing either confirmed by the
Fates, or appointed by the Gods. Tereus the Prince of
Thra
                     •
                  e, being sent by his Father to defie Pand
                     •
                  on the
king of Athens, was enamoured of his daughter Progne,
whereby betwéene the Parents in stéede of fatall enmitie,
there insued friendly amitie. When as the bloudie
warres betwéene Atis the King of Libia, and Lycabas
the Prince of Assur was most hot, young Admetus
being sent Ambassadour into Libia, was so stroken
in loue with Alcest, onely Daughter to his fathers foe,
and she repaying his lyking with such loyaltie, as death
it selfe could neuer dissolue their amitie. If madame,
these premisses may perswade you to take pittie of my
passions, or these examples induce you, not to let the hatred
of our parents be a hindrance of our loue, whether
your father reiect me as a foe, or accept me as a friende,
I doubt not but the destinies will driue the bargayne
through, in despite of them and fortune.
            Sir (quoth she) I confesse Progne poore wench loued
Tereus, but how wretchedly did he reward her loyaltie?
and Scylla was enamored of Mino
                     •
                  
                her fathers foe, but

how tyrannously did he repay her loue with treacherie,
Tarpeia betrayed the Tower of Rome to one of the Sabynes
whom she most entirely loued, but the méede of
her merite was extreame miserie. Shall I then Therfandro
sée the traine and yet fall into the trappe, shall I
spie the nettes, and yet strike at the stale? shall I sée
the mishap, and yet wilfully incurre the mischaunce, no
I meane not for an inch of ioye, to reape an ell of annoy,
for a moment of mirth a month of miserie, for a
dram of pleasure, a whole pound of paine, and by procuring
mine owne delight to purchase my fathers death
and destruction. But let this suffice Thersandro to signifie
how I pittie thy passions, and thinke wel of thy person,
that if my Fathers will might be framed to my
wish, if he would condiscend as I would consent, thou
onely art the man who in the way of mariage shoulde
dispose of me at thy plesure. But sith the frowning state
of Fortune denies our loue to haue such happie successe,
hope well, and rest vpon this poynt, that I will alwaies
like thee as a friend, though not loue thée as my pheere.
            AS Thersandro was ready to replye, and to seale vp
the bargaine of their loue vppon her swéete lippes,
Clerophontes came in, who marred all their market, &amp;
tourned their swéete to sower, for he gaue Thersandro
his aunswere before Lewcippa, which was this.
            That he neither ment to accept of the conditions of
peace, nor to receiue the tribute, but to claime his due by
the doubtfull euent of battaile. That he shortly pretended
in person to visite Orlanio, and within the walls of
Alexandria to demaund his debt, and that he would bestow
his Fathers Dukedome vpon a Lord of his called

                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
                in dowrie with his Daughter Lewcippa.
            
            
               
               Thersandro was nothing amazed with the first part
of the message, but when he hearde howe Clerophontes
meant presumptuously both to depraue him of his ly
               
                  •
               ing,
and depriue him of his Loue, he was so puffed vp
with wrath and chollar, as hap what hap would, he fell
into these tearmes.
            I Remember (quoth he) that Caligula the Emperour
prouiding a mightie armie to subdue great Britaine,
when he was come to the Sea, readie to post ouer
his Souldiours in his Nauie, he lefte off his endlesse
enterprise, and set them to gather Cockles. Siphax boldly
boasting that he would bestowe the kingdome of Numidia
vpon his second Sonne, was by Massinissa ouerthrowen,
and solde as captiue to the Romanes. I dare not
sir inferre comparisons, because they be odious, nor apply
the examples, sith time and place forbids me: but this
I say, that to fish before the net, is alwaies counted folly,
and to vaunt before the victorie, is but vanitie. Yea,
and if I had as good right to your Daughter Lewcippa,
as I haue to the supposed Dowrie which you assigne
her, I woulde in despight of Lucianus and the diuell
himselfe, dispose her at my pleasure.
            
               Clerophontes hearing the cholaricke conclusion of
Thersandro could scarcely bridle his frantick furie from
raging without reason against this young youth, yet
somewhat mittigating his moode, he breathed out these
cruell threatenings.
            IF the lawe of Armes (quoth he) did not both safely
protect thee, &amp; surely forbid me to hurt thée in y• thou
art a messenger, I would with such seueritie chastice
these thy presumptuous spéeches, as thou shuldest learn
héereafter to answere with more reuerence: yet I wysh
thée not to stande too stiffe vpon this poynt, least if thou

be so recklesse as to breake the bondes of reason, I be so
forgetfull as to passe the lymits of the law. Thou hast
receiued a determinate aunswere for the Embassage, &amp;
there I charge thée this present day to depart out of my
Dominions.
            
               Thersandro fearing the tyrannie of this cruell Clerophontes,
presently passed out of the Chamber of Presence,
taking his leaue of Ladie Lewcippa, onelye with
louing lookes, which she requited with such glaunces of
good will, as they were sufficient signes what insupportable
sorrowe she receiued by his so sodayne departure:
yet knowing that her fancie was incountred with
mutual affection, she droue away the mystie clowdes of
despaire, hoping that the Gods séeing their faithful amitie,
would take pitie of their passions, &amp; in time redresse
their miserie.
            But Thersandro hauing with spéede dispatchte hys
affaires (all his train being set aboord, and they coasting
the straights with a luckie gale) was so combred with
care, and so ouer-growen with griefe, that he passed no
hower, minute, nor moment, without wofull waylyng,
sorrowfull sobs, and farre fetcht sighes, so that the Gentlemen
his companions, supposing that he was thus
painfully perplexed for feare of Clerophontes pu
                  •
               ssance,
began both to comfort and incourage him not to doubte
or dread the force of the enimie, sith his father was able
to repulse him, without any daunger to himselfe, or any
great damage to his subiects. But these their perswasions
could no whit preuaile to asswage his passions, this
their incouragement coulde not cure his care.
            But as there is no greater bane to the bodye, than
trouble of the minde: so Thersandro so long continued
in these pensiue passions, and carefull cogitations, concealing
his griefe so couertly, which so much the more
furiously flamed within him, that he was constrayned

to kéepe his Cabbin till his arriuall at Alexandria.
            
            Where being set on shore, and presently conueyed to the
Courte, he remained for the space of thrée dayes, so
strangely perplexed, as he was not able to make report
of his message: which so griped Orlanio with such inspeakable
griefe, as he wished rather to haue died valiantly
 wt the force of hys enimye, than to put the health
of his sonne in hazard by passing so perillous a iournie.
But Thersandro séeing that sorrow would not salue his
sore, but rather increase his sicknesse: that mourning
would not appease his maladie, but rather augment his
miserie: began to take heart at grasse, and within few
dayes began to recouer his former health. And then hée
declared to his Father, what he had in charge from Clerophontes,
how he meant spéedely to wage war against
him, &amp; by force of armes to driue him out of his Dukedome,
which he had alreadie promised to one Lucianus
in dowrie with his Daughter. Orlanio hearing this
proud presumption of this bragging Duke, thought the
greatest barkers were not alwaies the sorest biters, and
that it was farre more easie with words to obtayne the
victorie, than with déeds to attayne the Conquest. Yet,
least he might be taken at vnwares, he made a generall
muster throughout all his Dominions, prouiding in
euery place necessarye munition for the defence of hys
Countrey. And assembling his Nobilitie to giue theyr
verdite, who were fittest to bée Captaines in this
skirmish: after some consultation had in this cause,
they concluded, that since Clerophontes meant to ioyne
battayle in his owne person, that lykewise hée shoulde
bee Generall of the field, and Gwydonius who surpassed
all the rest in martial exploites, should be Lieuetenant,
and conduct the armie, which he no sooner hearde but hée
was tormented with inspeakable griefe, he beganne to

pull downe his Peacockes feathers, to hang his wings,
and crye creake: euery man hoping to winne fame was
merrie, but he alone mourning: euery man laughed, &amp;
he alone lowred: insomuch, that he was generallye suspected
to be a fearfull cowarde, and that dread of daunger
draue him into these dolefull dumpes. But as they
rashly coniectured the cause of his sorrowe, so they mist
the nature of his sicknesse: for Gwydonius séeing that
of this cruel conflict his calamitie should ensue, and that
this bloudie broyle would bréed his bane, he fell into
such solitarie surmises, and such musing meditations,
that Valericus his open friende and yet his secrette foe,
sought by sundry meanes to search out the cause of his
care, but not being able to wring out any thing, eyther
by flattering promises or fained protestations, he ceased
frō his importunate sute. But froward fortune brought
it so to passe, that Valericus comming by the chamber of
Gwydonius, heard him thus desperatly discoursing with
himselfe.
            ALas (quoth he) I sée the Sunne being at the highest
declineth, the Sea being at full tide ebbeth: calme
continueth not long without a storme, neither is happinesse
had long without heauinesse, blisse without bale,
weale without woe, mirth without mourning. For who
a late so floated in the flouds of felicitie as I, which now
by the sinister meanes of frowning fortune am sowsed
in the seas of sorrow, exalted alate to the highest degrée
of happines, am nowe driuen to the greatest extremiti
                  •
               
of euill: alate puffed vp with prosperitie, &amp; now pushed
downe with aduersitie: yea, alate placed in Paradise,
and now plunged in perplexitie.
            Oh Gwydonius, if thy fathers friendlye preceptes

might haue perswaded thée, if his aduice had bene thy
aduertisement, and thou hadst carefully kept his counsaile,
then by his fore-warning thou hadst bene fore-armed
against all mishap and miserie. The force of fickle
fancie had not then giuen thee the foyle, loue had not so
lyghtly procured thy losse, nor the painted shew of beautie
had not so soone procured thy bane. My bane? Why
fond foole, beautie hath bred my blisse, fancie hath not
giuen me the foyle, but hath yéelded me the fort: Loue
hath not wrought my losse, but requited me with treble
gaine.
            Hath not Castania requited my loue with loyaltie,
and repayed my good will with mutuall affection? Is
shee not my Saint and I her seruaunt? Are wée not
contracted together by loue, and shall continue together
by lawe? May I not dispose of her in the waye of marriage
at my pleasure? Yes, but what then, the more is
my grief, and the greater is my care. For if her presence
procureth my delight, will not her absence bréede my despight?
If her consent preserued my life, will not her
contempt inferre my death? Yes. For alas sin
                  •
               e the destinies
meane to dissolue that fancie hath decréed, since
the frowning fates séeke to vnloose that which loue hath
linked, since froward fortune means to break the bonds
wherin beautie hath boūd vs, since these bloudie broiles
will cause Castania (where before shée accepted mée for
a friend) nowe to reiecte mée for a foe: What better
lucke canne I looke for, then a loathsome lyfe, or what
better happe can I hope for, than horrour and heauinesse?
Yea, which waye so euer I tourne mée I
sée nothing but woe and wretchednesse. For if Orlanio
perceyued our liking, how would he storme at our
loue? If he knew my chaunce, how woulde he fret at
his Daughters choyce? Woulde hée euer consent,

that Castania should match with so meane a mate, that
her princely personage should be disgraced with my base
parentage, that her calling shuld be crazed with my slender
countenaunce: no, he would no doubt first banish me
out of all his dominions. Tush Gwydonius, would God
this were the worst, and then thou mightest hope in
time by some meanes to redresse this doubt. But if Orlanio
shoulde knowe thou wert heire apparaunt to the
Dukedome of Metelyne, and onely sonne to Clerophontes,
his fatall foe, what torment were there so terrible,
which thou shouldest not trie? What paine so pinching,
which thou shouldst not passe? What hap so hard which
thou shouldest not hazard? Yea, what death so direfull,
which at his cruell hands thou shouldest not suffer? And
what if Castania were priuy to thy state, dost thou think
her so constaunt as to consent to her Fathers foe? doest
thou thinke she would wish the sonnes weale, when the
Father wisheth her mishap? No, assure thy selfe if thy
state be once knowen, that Castania wil most deadly detest
thée, which will be more grieuous to thée then death
it selfe, be it neuer so terrible. Sith then Gwydonius,
thou must shortly either go in armes against thine owne
father, or else loose both thy loue and thy life, let not delaie
bréede daunger, but strike on the stith while y• yron
is hot, Castania hath promised to forsake both Father,
friendes, and her owne countrie, to passe wher and when
it pleaseth thée, she doubteth no daungers, shée forceth of
no misfortune, she careth for no calamitie, she passeth for
no perills, so she inioy thy desired companie, and therefore
as spéedely as may be, conueie her closely into y• confines
of Metelyne, before eyther she know thy staie or thy
state. And shall I so practise her with pollicies? shall I
so sift her with subtiltie? shall I put so little trust in her
troth? and so small confidence in her constancie? as to cō
               ceale
from her anye secret? No, come woe, come wretchednesse,

come death, come daunger, hap what hap will, I
will presently impart vnto her my present state, and my
pretended purpose.
            
               Valericus hearing this doubtfull discourse of Gwydonius,
was driuen into an extasie for ioy, to sée that hée
had found such fit meanes whereby he might not onely
purchase the Dukes fauour, aspire vnto honour and dignitie,
but also obtaine the loue of Castania, for he meant
spéedely to preuent the pretence of Gwydonius by vnfolding
to the Duke the summe of his secrete purpose,
assuring himselfe, that after Orlanio knew his parents
and parentage, that hée was sonne and heire to Clerophontes,
no price though neuer so precious, no raunsome
though neuer so rich, might redéeme him from the most
despightfull death that could be deuised. And of these
premisses he inferde this conclusion, that the cause bée taken
awaie the effect faileth, that Gwydonius béeing reiected,
hée should bée receiued: that hée being despighted
with hate, he shoulde be requited with loue, and vppon
this hope he went presentlye to bewraie this matter to
Orlanio, whom he found with his sonne Thersandro, and
diuerse other noble men consulting what course they had
best take against Clerophontes, whome Valericus saluted
in this wise.
            
               PLato (right worthie Prince) that graue and wise philosopher,
whose sentences in all ages haue bene holden
as most diuine Oracles, portrayeth out in the books
of his Common wealth, the picture of a perfect Citizen,
whose liniaments béeing first leuelled, hée tricketh vp
with these coulours, that he loue his Prince loyallye,
kéepe the lawes carfully, and defend his Countrie valyantly,
in which thrée pointes (saith he) consisteth the chiefest
duetie of a trustie subiecte: this saying of Plato
throughly considered, and calling to minde the sundrie

good tournes which without desert your grace hath
bestowed vppon me, I thought if I shoulde not repaye
your fauour with faithfulnesse, and your trust you repose
in me with inuiolable troath, I might bée counted
a vicious vassall, deuoide of all vertue, a trecherous Citizen,
rather then a trustie subiect, a carelesse slaue, then
a carefull Gentleman: yea, a gracelesse monster, misled
with ingratitude. I am come (right worthie Sir) not to
betraie my foe, but to bewraie my friende, not to discouer
the fault of my enimie, but to disclose his offence,
which liueth with me in perfect amitie, in whose companie
hetherto hath ben all my ioy, pleasure and delight:
but since his pretence is greatlye preiudiciall to your
graces person, I thought to preferre your profite before
mine owne pleasure, and the commoditie of my countrie
before mine owne priuate contentation. So it is that
Gwydonius, whome your grace hath honoured, and all
the Court estéemed, is sonne and heire to Clerophontes,
the Duke of Metelyne, who by the péeuish pollicie of
his Father, vnder the pretence of seruice, is purposed to
procure your fatall death, and the finall destruction of
your Dukedome. And the better to performe this diuellish
practise, hée hath contracted himselfe to my Ladie
Castania, who blinded with his beautie, and inueagled
with his wit, hath consented, not onely to kéepe his
counsaile to your confusion, but also closely to conuey her
selfe with him into his Countrie. Which pretence if
your grace doth not spéedely preuent, you shall finde that
delaie bréedes daunger, &amp; that procrastination in perils
is but the mother of mishap.
            And haue I (quoth Orlanio) brought vp the Birde
that will picke out mine owne eyes? Haue I fostered vp
the Serpent in my bosome that will bréede my bane?
Haue I giuen her lyfe that séekes to yéelde me death?
Haue I cherisht her béeing younge, and wyll shée

consume me being older: was there none to choose but
Gwydonius, nor none to loue but the son of her fathers
foe? Will she preferre her lust before my life, her priuate
pleasure, before the safetie of my person? Well, as she forgets
the dutie of a child, so I will forget the natural affection
of a Father, and therefore Valericus, goe spéedely
with these noble men to Gwydonius chamber, and apprehend
him, that I may requite his hatefull trecherie
with most hellish torments. And Thersandro, sée you that
Castania be closely kept vntill we haue caught the traytour,
least she vnderstanding that their deuise is disclosed,
she saue her selfe by flight.
            
               Valericus hauing this commission giuen him from
the Duke, made no delay, but passed to Gwydonius lodging
with as much spéed as might be: but Fortune who
after euery chip of mischaunce, sendeth some lot of good
lucke, and after euerie storme of aduersitie, sendeth a quiet
calme of prosperitie, so carefully prouided to frée Gwydonius
from mishap, that he was newlye gone towardes
Castania, to impart vnto her this his pretence, but before
he came to her chamber, he was incountred by Thersandro,
who stearnly taking Gwydonius by the bosome, pulling
out his Rapier, commaunded him as a traitour to
stand, or else without anye farther doome he shoulde féele
the dint of death.
            
               Gwydonius amazed with this sodaine motion, stoode
as one in a traunce, neither being able to defend himselfe
with word or weapon, but yéelded himself into y• hands
of Thersandro, who shakt him vp with these bitter spéeches.
            THou traiterous wretch (quoth he) as it is impossible
for the flame so closely to bée couered, but it wyll bée
spied, so it is impossible, but that treason, though neuer
so secret, should in tract of time bée disclosed, which now

by experience is verified in thée, for although thou hast
hetherto falsely fained thy selfe to be a straunger of a foraine
nation, thou art now knowen to be sonne and heire
to Clerophontes that cruell tyraunt my Fathers foe,
by whose péeuish pollicy thou hadst not only brought the
common wealth to confusion, but didst pretend to be preiudiciall
to my fathers person, if thy deadly practise &amp; diuellish
purpose had not by Valericus his meanes ben preuented.
Hast thou ben so trained vp in trecherie, or is thy
minde so spotted with villany, as to repaie my Fathers
good wil with such barbarous ingratitude, and to deuise
his destruction which simply foresought thy preferment.
Yea, to counsel my sister Castania, not onely to consent to
thy desire, but to my fathers death? Is this the manner
of Metelyne? or the custome of thy countrie, to be such cosoning
counterfaits? Well, since I haue happely attached
thée as a traitour, &amp; as a villanous rebell, both transgressing
humane and diuine lawes, thou shalt abide the
paine &amp; punishment due to such diuellish offenders. Now
let thy cruell sire Clerophontes frée thée from those torments
that thou art like to suffer for thy trecherie, &amp; let
the Lords of Metelyne deliuer thée from his hands, who
meanes in most miserable wise to martir thée. Yea, let
thy Concubine Castania, who is like for her gracelesse
disobedience to sippe of the same sorrowe, sée if her teares
will now preuaile to mooue Orlanio to pittie. No, if Iupiter
himselfe sent Mercurie to mittigate his moode, neither
the authoritie of the one, nor the eloquence of the
other might preuaile to pacif
                  •
               e his furie.
            
               GWydonius séeing that not onely his purpose was preuented,
and his secretes disclosed, but that also Valericus
most villanously had accused him and Castania of
that which they neuer so much as once imagined, was so
perplexed, and driuen into such dumpes, as he séemed by

               
                  ••
               lence

               o a
                  •
               erre that which Thersandro had alleadged,
yet at last he began thus to replie.
            
               THersandro (quoth he) as I meane not to affirme that
which is false, so I will not denie that which is true,
but come dolor, come death, come miserie, come martyrdome,
come torture, come torments, I wil neither accuse
my selfe iniustly, nor excuse my selfe by periurie. I confesse
Thersandro that I am sonne and heire to the Duke
of Meteline, &amp; contracted to thy sister Castania, that Clerophontes
is my father by the lawe of nature, &amp; Castania
my wife by the league of loue, but that I either pretended
or purposed to be preiudiciall to Orlanios person, or
y• 
               Castania was counsailed or euer consented to her Fathers
confusion, I not onely denie, but I will proue by
combat, that Valericus most villanously doth accuse vs
of that whereof we are altogether sacklesse.
            WHy Gwydonius, (quoth he) wilt thou séeke to proue
thy self loial, when the hearers déeme thée a lyar, or
to make a tryall of thy troth, when thy words can haue
no trust? Doest thou thinke my fathers furie will suffer
thée to fable? Doest thou thinke his wrathfull rage will
abide thy reasons, or that he wil be so patient as to heare
thée pleade thine owne cause? No, if thou wert as cléere
from these crimes alleadged against thée by Valericus as
I am, yet in that thou art sonne to Clerophontes, the
coine of Croesus, and kingdomes of Caesar, were not sufficient
raunsome to redéeme thée from death. But Gwydonius,
since thy health hangeth in my handes, and
thy lyfe or death is in my power, I will neither bée so
bloudie minded as to bréede thy bane, nor so cruell, as to
be the cause of thy confusion. The guerdon Gwydonius
I craue for this my good will, and the recompence I
claime for this curtesie, is: that when thou commest to

               Metelyne, thou certifie thy sister and my loue and Ladie
Lewcippa, that for her sake I haue procured thy safetie,
that her perfection hath preserued thée from perill, the
loue I beare her hath saued thy lyfe, the duetifull deuotion
I owe vnto her, hath redéemed thée from death and
daunger. And in token of this my vnfained affection, I
will lift my hand against none that commeth from Metelyne,
but against Lucianus onely.
            Before Thersandro was able fullye to vnfolde his
minde, or that Gwydonius had time to yéeld him thanks
for the sauegard of his lyfe, they hearde a greate noise,
which made Gwydonius flie, and Thersandro hie him hastely
to Castanias lodging. Nowe the companie which
came, was Orlanio himselfe, who certified by Valericus
that Gwydonius could not be found, laid not only watch
and ward throughout all his Dukedome to attach him,
but went in proper person with his Garde to apprehend
Castania, and laie her in close prison, whom he found all
blubbered with teares, for that she had vnderstoode the
cause before of her brother▪ 
               Thersandro: Orlanio no sooner
spied her thus wéeping, but he raged against her in this
wise.
            HAth the force of loue, nay rather the furie of lust (vild
wretch) so blinded thy vnderstanding, that to accomplish
it thou passest not to peruert both humane and diuine
lawes. Doth lasciuious affection and fleshly fancie
so furiously frie within thée, as thou woldest procure thy
fathers death to purchase thy diuellish desire? Could no
rules of reason, no prick of conscience, no respect of honestie,
no feare of God, nor dread of man, prohibit thée from
pretending such a monstrous mischiefe, as to conclude wt
my mortal foe to worke my fatall confusion. The young
Storkes so tender the old ones in their age, as they will
not suffer thē so much as to 
                  〈◊〉
                to get their owne liuing.

The Bird called Apis Indica, being young, séeing the old

to wa

                them continually from
place to place on their backs: these sauage creatures haue
but onely sence, and are obedient, thou hast both reason &amp;
sence, &amp; art more vnnatural, these bruite beasts are most
dutifull to their parents, and thou a reasonable creature
art most disobedient to thy Father: yea, contrarie both
to the lawes of Nature and nurture, thou séekest to
bath thy handes in his guiltlesse bloude, and without
care or conscience to commit most cruell murther, which
is so hatefull to all things, as the sencelesse plantes and
stones most deadlye detest such villanie. The Oliue
trée so hatefully abhorreth a Parracide, that who so béeing
guiltie of that crime, attempteth to plant it, dooeth
not onely himselfe presently perish, but the trée forthwith
wayneth and wythereth. The stone Epistrites so loatheth
this offence, counting it a fact so repugnaunt to nature,
that it wil not vouchsafe to be worne by a murtherer.
And shall I then let thée liue whō the sencelesse creatures
do so deadly loath. No, this hād which cherisht thée
being a child shall now chastise thée béeing such a cursed
caitife. And with that he drew out his Fawlcon redie to
haue slaine her. But that Thersandro knéeling down, desired
him that he would not so in his furie forget himselfe,
as without the sentence of the law put her to death,
but to commit her to ward vntill the wars betwéen him
&amp; Clerophontes were happely ended, &amp; then vppon more
straight examination, if she wer found faultie, to assigne
her a punishment due for such an offence. Orlanio somewhat
pacified with his sonnes perswasion, commanded
that presently she should be carried to prison, and the Ladie
Melytta with her, as an actor also in this Tragedie.
And that with all spéed they should post the countrie for
the attaching of the traitor Gwydonius.
            
            
               Who after that he parted from Thersandro, séeing before
his eyes the terrour of torments, and the hellish
horrour of death, was driuen forward so with the dread
of daunger, and feare of imminent perills, that knowing
perfectly the coast of the Countrry, he passed so secretly
&amp; spéedely, as he was not so much as once descried
by the Postes that pursued him, but scaped safely
                  •
                out
of the Dukedome of Alexandria. Béeing now without
the dint of the Dukes daunger, séeing that although hée
had escaped himselfe, yet he had lefte his Loue and Ladie
Castania in hazarde of her life, he began thus to exclaime
against his owne folly.
            AH Gwydonius (quoth he) what folly hast thou committed
by this thy fearefull flight, what carefull calamitie
is like to insue of this thy cowardise in auoyding
Scylla thou art falne into Cha
                     •
                  ibdis, in preuenting
one danger thou art like to be plagued with a thousand
discommodities. Had it not bene better for thée to haue
died in Alexandria with honor than to lyue heere with
shame and reproach, to haue suffered mishap with Castania
then to linger héere in miserie? Doost thou thinke
that she will euer count of such a prating Paras
                  •
               te, as
will loue her in prosperie and leaue her in aduersitie, as
preferreth his owne safetie before her securitie, his lyfe
before her loue, and draweth himselfe out of daunger to
leaue her in distresse? No, she will contempne thée as a
coward, more fit to be a mate to some country 
                  ••
               nt, than
a 
                  •
               atch for such a courtly Princesse, she will thinke thy
greatest faith was but fained ficklenesse, thy forged loue
was but filthie lust, thy promises was but periuries,
and that thy greatest amitie was but most dissembled
enmitie: so that of a professed friend she wil become thy
professed foe, her desire will tourne to despite, and her
loue to most hellish hate.
            
               
Why alas, would my paine haue pleased her, would
my martirdome haue contented her minde, had my peril
procured her profite, or my care her commoditie. Naye,
rather would not my daunger haue bene her death, my
mishap her miserie, my torture her torments, and my
fatall destinie hir finall destruction. By sauing my life
in time we maye enioye our loue, but by death no hope
had bene lefte for obtaining our desire: so that I assure
my selfe, Castania will rather allowe of my pollicie by
preuenting perilles by flight, than mislyke of my practise
in procuring mine owne safetie. And vpon this point
I rest, hoping that the Gods séeing how vniustly Valericu;
hath accused vs, will in tract of time ridde vs from
blame and reward him with shame.
            
               GWydonius was not more distressed with dolour than
poore Castania was combred, wt care to sée so strange
a chaunce and so sodaine a chaunge, that she who of
late was a royall Princesse, was now a ruthfull prisoner,
that her fréedome was tourned to fettars, her dignitie
to miserie, and her happie stay to a most hellish state:
that after flouds of teares which fell from her Christall
eyes, she burst foorth into these tearmes.
            ALas (quoth she) what poore Damosell was euer driuen
into such doubtfull distresse? what Princes was
euer perplexed with such dolefull passions? what mayde
was euer crossed with such mishap? nay what creature
euer was clogged with the like calamitie? Haue the
spightfull destinies decréed my destruction, or ye peruers
                  •
               
Planets conspired my bitter bane? Dooth froward fortune
meane to make me a mirrour of her mutabilitie,
or is this the rewarde that Cupid bestowes vppon hys
Clyents? Is euery one that dooth fancie maymed with

the like misfortune, or is loue alwayes accōpanied with
such haplesse lucke? Alas no, for their loue is lawfull, &amp;
mine leawd and lasciuious: their fancie is fixed vppon
vertue, and mine vpon vanitie, they make their matche
with consent of their parents, and I my market without
my fathers counsaile: so that I am like in choosing
such chaffre, to chop and chaunge and liue by the losse:
yea, to buye repentance at an vnreasonable rate. Had it
not bene better for thée Castania, to haue condiscended to
the requests of Valericus, then consented to the sute of
Gwydonius: to haue liked thine owne countrey-man,
than loued a straggeling straunger: to haue satisfied thy
selfe with assuraunce, than vainely to fish for hope?
            Truth, but what then? can the strawe resist the vertue
of the pure Iet? can the flaxe resist the force of the fire?
can a louer withstand the brunt of beautie? fréeze, if he
stande by the flame: peruert the lawes of nature, or eschew
that which is framed by the fates, or flye from
the force of fa
                  •
               cie? No, for who so escapeth the deadlye
dartes of Cupid, shall be scorched with his fire, and shée
that with the deaw of chastitie quencheth this flame,
shall be o
                  •
               er-taken with his wings: so that to seeke by
flight to eschewe affection, is foolishly to enterprise that
which can neuer be atchieued.
            But alas, if I must néedes lende a listening eare to
the allurements of loue, was there none to like but thy
Fathers foe? Now fonde foole couldest thou shew him
courtesie, that intendes to repaye thée with crueltie?
Howe couldest thou choose the sonne to thy mate, when
the father séekes thy miserie? It is not possible to mixe
the bloud of a Bull and a Beare together in one vessel.
The Lyons whelpes wil neuer cōpanie with the young
Wolues: the Fawlchons called Pelagrae will neuer fly
with the young Lauaretes, and if the egges of a
Crowe and a Curlewe bée put in one neaste, they

both foorthwith burst in sunder, because there is such
                  •
               
auncient enmitie betwéene the olde ones. And wilt thou
then be so wilfull to loue him whome thy Father dooth
loath, or so peruerse as to place thy selfe in that Parentage,
where there is such mortall hatred betwéene y• Parents?
wilt thou so farre forget the duetie of a childe, as
more to respect thy fatall enemie, than regard thy naturall
father? But why vilde wretche doo I thus fondely
fable, though Clerophontes be my fathers foe, yet Gwydonius
is my faithfull friende: though the one séeke to
procure my paine, the other séekes to purchase my pleasure:
though the olde sire striues to subuert my fathers
state, yet the sonne neuer sought to be preiudicall to his
person: although that periured parasite Valericus hath
most vniustly accused him of treacherie. Shall I then
hate him who hath alwaies honoured me? shall I work
his woe that wisheth my weale? shal I be his bane, who
hath bred my blisse? shall I detest him, which serueth me
with most déepe deuotion? No, I héere heartely powr
                  •
               
out most pitifull plaints to the Gods to preserue my
Gwydonius from perill, and that Fortune may so fauor
him as he may passe out of Alexandria without death
or danger. What though I héere in prison pine in pain,
what though I sinke in sorrowe, what though I be distressed
with griefe, and oppressed with miserie, what
though I be crossed with care, and combred with calamitie?
Tush, let my Father fret and fume in his furie,
let my brother rage and rayle, let that traitor Valericus
triumph, and all the Countrey most bitterly curse me:
yea, let them martir me most miserablye, let them torment
me most terribly, yet direful death shall not feare
me, as long as I know Gwydonius is deuoyde of daunger.
For I hope though fortune frowne, though the destinies
denie it, though y• fates forsweare it, yea though
the Gods themselues say no, yet in time we shall haue

such happie successe, as the loyaltie of our loue, and the
cléerenesse of our conscience by the lawe of Iustice doo
deserue. And therefore Gwydonius shall be the Planet
whereby to direct my dooings, he shall be the starre shal
guide my compasse, he shall be the hauen to harbor in, &amp;
the Saint at whose shrine I meane to offer my deuotion.
            
               Castania hauing thus discoursed with her selfe, shée
determined when the warres were ended, if she coulde
haue no hope to enioy the loue of Gwydonius, to confesse
her faults, and to sue for mercie at the barre of her Fathers
curtesie, not that she meant to liue without Gwydonius,
or to loue or like anye other, but to prolong her
dayes in dolour, that she might most rigorously reuenge
the villanie of Valericus, and by bathing in his bloude
she might both satisfie her selfe and signifie to Gwydonius
how intirely she loued and lyked him. But leauing
her perplexed with these passions, againe to Clerophontes.
            
            Who frying still in his franticke furie, was not any
whit perswaded to conclude peace with Orlanio, but hauing
mustred his men, as speedely as might be, imbarkt
them, and with a luckie gale arriued at the coast of Alexandria,
wher the borderers not able to abide his force,
were constrained to saue themselues by f
                  •
               ight. But hee
as a man hauing exiled from his heart both pietie and
pitie, bathed his hands in guiltlesse bloud fiering euery
fort, battering downe euery bulwarke, sacking each Citie,
racing downe the walles to the grounde, and commaunding
his souldiours vpon paine of most greeuous
punishment, not to haue any respect of persons, neyther
to regarde the hoarie haires of the aged Citizens, nor
the tender yeares of the sucking Infants, but to imbrue
their blades with the bloud of all men, of what degrée
soeuer.
            
               
               Orlanio hearing how Clerophontes had inuaded hy
                  •
               
dominions, and with what barbarous crueltie hee hadde
murthered his subiects, hauing also intelligence by his
Scowtes, that his armie was passing huge, the better to
resist the furious force of his enimie, hyred out of other
Countreyes, a great multitude of Mercenarie Souldiours,
so that he gathered a meruailous great hoast, wherin
was an infinit number indued with great skill, and
long experience.
            Furnished thus sufficiently both with men and munition
like a wise and warie Captaine, séeing that he no
waye els might resist the puissaunt power of so mightie
a Prince, determined without further delaye
to méete him and to giue him present battaile, hauing
meruailous affiaunce in the approoued manhoode &amp; vertue
of his Souldiours.
            
               Clerophontes likewise being of such a valiaunt and
inuincible courage, as he séemed from his infancie to bée
vowed to Mars and martiall affaires, manfully marched
forward to méete with his enimies, which he performed
so spéedely, that within few dayes, both the Armies wer
within viewe, which Clerophontes séeing, he began to
incourage his souldiours on this sort.
            ALthough most trustie subiects (quoth he) I neither
doubt of your prowesse, nor haue cause to feare your
manhoode, as hauing mine Armie fraught with the most
couragious Captaines, and boldest blouds of Metelyne,
yet I wish you to consider how desperately we haue aduentured
vpon the Conquest of this Dukedome, which
if we atchieue, we shal not onely gaine perpetual fame
and renowme, but reap such riches and treasure, as shall
sufficiently counteruaile our trauaile. But to obtaine
this victorie we must behaue our selues valiantly, neither
dreading any daunger though neuer so desperate,

nor doubting any perill though neuer so fearefull. Before
our face we haue our enimies, behinde our backes
the surging seas, so that fight we must, but flye we cannot:
in being couragious we winne the fielde, and returne
conquerours: in proouing cowards, we both loose
our liues and the conquest: if we foyle our foes we returne
with triumph, if we faint and flye we haue no
hope of safetie, but death and desperation is imminent.
Be then hardie to hazard, and valiaunt to venture amiddest
the prease of your enimies, that daunted with
your valour they may be forced to flye, and we both triumph
and inioy the treasure.
            
               CLerophontes hauing thus louinglye incouraged his
souldiers, Orlanio on the other side séeing his men
began to feare the force of the enimie, and were amazed
with such a monstrous multitude, prickt them forward
with this Parle.
            
            THat mightie Monarch Alexāder y• great, who for his
martiall exployts, was a mirror to all his posteritie,
whose prowesse was such as he daunted Darius, &amp; by his
inuincible courage made a conquest of the whole world:
hearing on a time one of his Captaines to demaunde
what multitude was in their enimies campe, aunswered,
that it was not the point of a good soldier to inquire
how many the enimies were, but wher they were, meaning
that to feare the multitude is rather the signe of
cowardise, then a tokē of courage. Which saying I wish
you carefully to consider, y• the huge army of Clerophontes
neither amaze your minds, nor abate your valor, sith
y• the equitie of our cause doth more thē counteruaile his
companie. He inuadeth our realme without reason, &amp; we
defend but our owne right: he cruelly séeketh to depriue
vs of fréedō, &amp; we lawfully do maintain our own liberty.

He tirannously striueth to make vs bondslaues, and we
fight to frée our selues from captiuitie. If he preuayle
let vs looke for no pittie, but that we shall be murdered
without mercie, we shall sée before our face our wiues
rauished, our daughters defloured, our parents put to
death, our children slaine, our goods spoyled, our Citie
sacked, and our selues brought to vtter ruth and ruyne.
Sith then we are placed betwéene two extremities, eito
possesse our owne with plentie, or to passe our liues
in penurie: let vs valiauntly venter whatsoeuer wée
gaine, let vs fight without feare: for better it is to die
with honour, than to liue with shame.
            BY that time Orlanio had ended his Oration, the Armies
met in a Plaine, within thirtie leagues of Alexandria.
Where both of them ordering (as became good
Captaines) their people, there began in the breake of the
day, the most cruell and terrible battaile that earst was
heard of, considering the number on both partes, theyr
experience and pollicie, with the valiant prowesse and
courage of the Captaines. Thus continued they in
fight, euen almost vntill éeuen, with meruaylous
slaughter on both sides, the victorie yet doubtfull, till in
the ende the Alexandrians began to faint and flye, more
oppressed with the excesse of the multitude, than distressed
for want of manhoode, for there were two and fortie
thousand slaine, but not one taken prisoner, and of Clerophontes
companie eight and twentie thousand slain,
and sixe hundred mortally wounded. This monstrous
massacre and fearefull slaughter, so amazed the mindes
of these two Captaines, that for the better burying of
the dead, and healing of them which were hurte, they
concluded a truce betwéene them for fiftéene dayes, in
which time Orlanio sent Ambassadors to parle of peace
wt 
               Clerophontes, but in vaine: for he was resolued either

valiantly to die in the field with glorie, or to inioye the
Dukedome of Alexandria with renowme. Yet as a worthie
Prince, preferring the securitie of his soldiers before
the safetie of his owne person, he offered them the combat,
which Orlanio to auoide the effusion of bloud, most
willingly accepted. Nowe it was agréed and concluded
betwéene thē, that two champions might be chosen, who
by the dint of the swoord should stint the strife betwéene
these two armies. If he of Metelyne remained victor,
then Orlanio shuld not onely paie his former tribute, but
deliuer vp his Dukedome into the hands of Clerophontes.
But if y• 
               Alexandrians obtained y• conquest, y• Duke
of Metelyne should peaceably depart the countrie, release
the tribute, and also resigne his state, and become a subiect
to Orlanio. And for the better kéeping &amp; confirming
of these conditions, they presentlye dispatcht Embassadours
to Fernandus the king of Bohemia, to intreate his
maiestie that he would vouchsafe to become iudge in the
combat, who for that he wished wel to both these dukes,
graunted to their requests, and with as much spéede as
might be, came to Alexandria. But in the meane time
there was some difference aboute the champions. For
Clerophontes sayd, that sith in loosing the field, consisted
the losse of liuing, life, and libertie, and in getting y• victorie,
the gaine of a Dukedome, he would in proper person
fight the combat and trie the chance of Fortune, and
therefore made a challenge to Orlanio. But he finding
himselfe farre vnfit to resist his furious force, refused it.
Yet promising, that none vnlesse he were descended of
Nobilitie should enter the lists, wherwith Clerophontes
was verie well contented. Nowe while this truce
continued, which was prolonged for thirtie dayes, it was
lawfull for them of Alexandria to come and viewe the
campe of Metelyne, and for the Metelynes to goe and sée
the Citie. Wherevpon Clerophontes desirous to sée Orlanio
               
and his Court, went onelye accompanied with his
garde to Alexandria, where he was most royally entertained,
and sumptuously feasted by Orlanio, both of them
remitting the rigour of their mallice, till it shoulde bee
shewed in effect, by reason of their manhood. But as soone
as Thersandro and the other Lords saw Clerophontes, y•
he was rather a monster then a man, hauing each lim so
strongly couched, each part so proportioned, so huge of stature,
&amp; so fierce of countenance, they were so daūted with
the sight of his persō, as they almost feared to come in his
presence, saying: that thereof the boldest blouds in Alexandria
were not able to abide the force of Clerophontes.
Who now peaceably departing to his hoast, lefte Orlanio
as greatly perplexed for assēbling his nobilitie together,
amongst whom he appointed the champion shuld be chosen.
They not onely with one consent withstood his cō
               maund,
but began to murmure and mutine against him,
condempning him of folly that he would so vnaduisedly
commit his own state, &amp; ther stay to the doubtful hazard
of one mans hap. Orlanio seeing y• it was now no time to
chastise this their presumption, vnlesse he meant to raise
ciuill dissention in the citie, which were the next way to
confirme the enimie, &amp; bréed his owne confusion, he dissē
               bled
his cholar &amp; began to work a new way. For first he
fréed Castania out of prison, thē made generall proclamation
throughout his Dukedome, y• what Lord so euer wt
               in
his land would try the combat with Clerophontes, if
he remained victor in the conquest, he would not onely
giue him his daughter Castania to wife, let him possesse
peaceably the Dukedome of Metelyne as her dowry, but
be content to acknowledge him as his liege, &amp; paye him
tribute, as he was wont to Clerophontes.
            
            While he lingered and listened how this proclamition
would preuaile, Castania hearing this seuere sentence &amp;
dolefull doome pronounced, séeing that shoulde not onely

be forced to forsake Gwydonius, but be constrained to
match in marriage with one whome shée should neyther
loue nor like, burst forth into these bitter complaintes.
            A Alasse (quoth she) how pinching a pain it is to be perplexed
with diuers passions, what a noisome care it is
to be combred with sundrie cogitations, what a woo it is
to hang betwéene desire &amp; despaire, &amp; what a hell it is to
houer betwéene feare and hope. For as to him which is
assured to die, death is no dolour, in that he perfectlye
knowes there is no salue can cure his sorrow, so to him
which feares to die, &amp; yet hopes to liue, death were thrice
more welcome, then to linger in such doubt. In which
cursed case alas my case consisteth, for as out of the riuer
Cea in Sicillia bursteth most feareful flames, and yet the
streame is passing colde, neither is the water able to
quench the fire, nor the fire cause the water to bée hotte,
so the heate of hope flameth out of the chilling fountaine
of feare, &amp; yet the force of the one is not able to asswage
the vehemencie of the other, but still my heauie heart is
diuersly assailed with them both. If my Father Orlanio
winne the conquest, I doubt my desire shall neuer haue
happie successe, if Clerophontes triumphe as victour, I
greatly feare his crueltie is such, as I shall not escape
most haplesse death. And yet againe I hope that then my
own Gwydonius wil accept me for his, and with triumphant
armes imbrace me. But alas, will Clerophontes
suffer him to match with his mortal so, wil he not rather
preuent it by my peril? Yes no doubt, if he returne with
triumph, my Father shal serue him as a subiect, my brother
shall become his vassall, my friendes shall bée forlorne,
my Citie sackt, and my natiue Countrie brought
to vtter confusion. And shall I for the loue of a straunger
wishe these straunge stratagemmes? Shall I
to féede mine owne fancie, and content my lustinge

minde, wish my Fathers death, my Brothers bane, my
friends mishap, my Countries confusion, and perhappes
my owne miserie. For though Gwydonius loued mée
when our parents were friendes, he will not now lyke
me béeing foes: but to reuenge the iniuries my Father
offered him, will subtilly séeke to sacke my honour and
honestie, and so triumph of my shame and discredit. Had
I not better praie my Father may winne the combat, &amp;
then shall I bath in the streames of blisse, and flowe in
the flouds of felicitie, then shall I dread no daunger, no
feare, no perills: then shall I see my father, friendes, and
Countrie, flourish in most happie prosperitie: then shall
I inioy some iolly Gentleman, who will loue me béeing
young, and cherish me being olde, and possesse the Dukedome
of Metelyne for my dowrie. And canst thou Castama
be so ingratefull, as to will his woe which wisheth
thy weale, to desire his destruction which prayeth
for thy prosperitie? canst thou be so couetous as to 
                  •
               rau
                  •
               
that for thy possession, which is thy Gwydonius patrim
                  •
               
               nie,
or so suspitious as to accuse him of trecherie, which
hath bene but to trustie: to count him a counterfaite,
which hath alwaies bene constant? No, come what come
will, let froward fortune fauour whome she please, so I
may ioy and safely inioy my onely ioy Gwydonius.
            
            As Castania had thus ended her complaint, Gwydonius
who all this while lurked about the borders of Alexandria,
heard what successe Orlanios affaires had with
his Father Clerophontes, how verie fewe or none at all
durst trie the combat with him, that his loue and Ladie
Castania was the prise that he should get that gained the
conquest. Which things considered, supposing y• 
               Castania
had cast him off, &amp; that she plaid, out of sight out of mind,
by a secret and trustie messenger, he presented her with
this Letter.
            
               
                  
                  Gwydonius to Castania
health.
                  THE pure spice Castania the more it is pounded, the
swéeter smell it yéelds, the Camomill increaseth most
béeing troden on, the Palme trée the greater waight it
beareth, the straighter it groweth, the stone Terpistetres
the more it is beaten the harder it is, and loyall loue is
not weakened by the stormes of aduersitie, but rather far
the more fortified by the froward state of frowning fortune:
which Madame I speake by proofe and experience,
for since I haue sipped of the sower dregs of sorrow, and
bene pestered with the bitter pills of penurie, since sinister
fortune hath crossed me with mishaps, and disaster
fates haue driuen me downe to miserie, my fancie hath
so furiously assaulted my minde, and affection hath so incessantly
battered the bulwarke of my brest, as y• sparks
of loue which were kindled in me in prosperitie, are turned
to fierce and firie flames by aduersitie. So that madame,
your presence did not before procure me such pleasure,
as your absence doth paine, neither was I so drowned
in delight in frequenting your companie, as I am
drenched with despight by leading my life in sorrowfull
calamitie. Alasse Castania what vnspeakeable griefe
hath tormented mée? what direfull dolour hath distressed
me? what hellish horrour hath hunted me? yea, what
woe and wretchednesse hath wracked my wittes, since
thou hast béene proclaymed a praie to him whosoeuer
winneth the prise in the combat. Howe ofte haue I wished
that I might bée the champion to make the challenge,
that I might venture my lyfe to purchase thy
lybertie, that my death might redéeme thée from daunger.
                  But alasse, I sée to wishe is in vaine, to to craue

of the Gods, that thy Father shoulde vaunt of the victorie,
is but to wish that your loue shoulde haue haplesse
successe: to praie that Clerophontes should returne with
conquest, thou wilt déeme I desire thy friends misfortune,
thus assailed with diuerse doubtes, I driue off my
dayes in dolour: hoping howsoeuer fortune froune, that
the fates wil assigne vs a perfect calme of permanent felicitie,
for this sturdie storme of pinching miserie.
                  
                     Thine euer, exiled Gwydonius.
                  
               
            
            
               CAstania hauing receiued this Letter, séeing that no sinister
chaunce of fortune was able to change y• fixed
fancie of Gwydonius, conceiued such assured hope in his
constancie, as now she thought his troth was filed with
no spot of trecherie, that his faith was quite deuoide of
flatterie, and that whatsoeuer chaunced, she might safely
repose her staie and state in his loyaltie. Insomuch
that to driue out the euill opinion which she thought her
brother Thersandro had conceiued of Gwydonius conspiracie,
shée secretly shewed him the Letter, which after he
had read ouer and carefully construed euerie clause, hée
began both to detect and detest the villanie of Valericus,
desiring his sister Castania that she would earnestly perswade
Gwydonius in disguised apparell spéedelye to repaire
to her lodging, promising with solempne vowes
and sacred oaths, not to bée preiudiciall to his person:
Castania affying greatly in her brothers faith, and desirous
to haue a sight of her louing Gwydonius, returned
him these fewe lines.
            
               
                  
                  Castania to Gwydonius,
prosperitie.
                  WHo so tasteth Gwidonius of the hearbe Mely, Sophilos
is neuer tormented with the sting of aduersitie,
and she that weareth the stone Mephites aboute her, neuer
soroweth at sinister fortune, who so fancieth without
faining neuer proueth fickle, and she that loueth loyally
may well be crossed with calamitie, but neuer iustly accused
of inconstancie. Account thy Castania good Gwydonius
to be in the same predicament, for let disaster mishap
driue me downe to most deadlye miserie, let the cruell
fates compasse me with cursed care, l
                        •
                     t fortune and the
destinies conclude my confusion, yet it shall not diminish
my fancie, but rather increase my affection. I will stil in
weale, in woe, in bale, in blisse, in mirth &amp; miserie, say I
loue, and it is onely Gwydonius. For shall our fancie bée
such as it shal be foiled with misfortune: no, but as Thetis
chaunging into many shapes, at last returned into her
owne forme, so into what mishap I be driuen by misery,
yet I will stand in mine olde state in despight of ye fates
and fortune. Come therefore Gwydonius to the court in
disguised apparell, but without care, for thou shalt
finde me so trustie, as my troth shall be without spotte, &amp;
thy health without hazard. Thus wishing thy curtesie to
conster well of my constancie, I bid thée farewell.
                  
                     Thine or not her owne, constant Castania.
                  
               
            
            
               GWidonius hauing carefully construed ouer y• contents
of this louing letter, although ye rigor of Orlanio might
haue giuē him sufficient cause of suspitiō, yet ye cléerenes
of his own conscience &amp; the loue he bare to Castania, wold

not suffer him eyther to suspect anie treason, or to doubt
of anie deceit, but determined without any delay to put
the saftie of his person and the sauegard of his life into
her handes. But leauing him to bring his purpose luckely
to passe, againe to Orlanio.
            
            Who séeing that his proclamation could not preuaile,
and that his nobles preferred their owne safetie before
his securitie, was perplexed with such hellish passions,
and griped with such pinching griefe, as the Ghoasts tormented
with gri
                  ••
               y fiends felt no such haplesse furie. To
fight with Clerophontes, he felt his strength farre vnfit
to resist his force, to denie the combat hée neither could
                  •
               
nor wold, although he brought himselfe to confusion, and
his children to captiuitie, so that howsoeuer he tourned
himselfe, he sawe before his face death and dispaire, woe
and wretchednesse, mishap and miserie. Combred thus
with this curelesse care, and sitting solitarily in sorrow,
séeing the dismal day drew on, and hearing that Fernandus
the king of Bohemia was lately landed, he fell into
more furious passions, vntill he was driuen out of his
dumps by his sonne Thersandro, who perceiuing his father
thus dolefully daunted, he began most louingly to
comfort him, promising that since none durst venture to
deale with Clerophontes, he himselfe would fight y• combat,
and either worthelye winne the conquest with renowme,
or manfully die in the field with honour.
            
               Orlanio hearing the bold courage of this new champion,
felt his sorrow somewhat salued by this proffer, perswading
himselfe y• his sonne was better able to abide ye
brunt then he, &amp; hoping that the Gods would fauour the
equitie of the cause, and assuredly by iustice graunt him
the victorie. Resting I saie vppon this hope, and thanking
Thersandro for his naturall affection, and praysing
him for his noble courage, hée presentlye went
to méete Fernandus, whom he most princely entertained,

conducting him very royally into Alexandria, where hée
most sumptuously feasted him and all his traine. But
as they passed away the time in pastime and pleasure,
so poore Thersandro spent the daye in dolour and the
night in sorrowe. For although to comfort his Father he
made light of the combat, and valiauntly offered himselfe
to trie the chaunce of Fortune, yet séeing his enimies
force farre to excéede his féeble strength, he began
to faint, although like a worthie Gentleman he couered
his dreadfull courage with a desperate countenaunce,
raunging vp and downe the fieldes to driue awaye his
melancholy, where by chaunce in disguised apparaile he
met Gwydonius, to whom after some Parle past betwéen
them, he bewrayed the whole state of the matter, howe
he was to enter combat with Clerophontes, and that hée
doubted greatly of the euent of the victorie, fearing the
force of his Father, and fainting at his owne imbecilitie.
Which Gwydonius hearing he made this short aunswere.
            
               THersandro (quoth he) it is vaine with long talke to
passe away the time when delay bréedes daunger, &amp;
folly to hope for faire weather when the aire is ouercast
with clowdes: leauing off therefore all oathes to
confirme my faith, thus much to the purpose. If it please
thée to trust me without triall, and to giue anye confidence
to my words, I héere promise both to make manifest
my loyall loue to Castania, and to repay thy courtesie,
that I will, resembling thy person, and disguised in
thy armor, enter combat with my father Clerophontes,
either intending by winning the victorie to obtaine my
will, or by loosing the conquest to want my wish: if this
my proffer please thée, I will passe priuilie to yt Court,
if not good Thersandro, let me goe as I came.
            
               
               Thersandro commending the subtill deuise of Gwydonius
caried him as couertly as could be to Castania, to
whom he was 
                  〈◊〉

presented himselfe▪ Who séeing, that forced by the
fond allurements of loue, he was to fight, not wyth his
mortal foe, but with his natural father, he fell into these
doubtfull dumpes.
            Alas poore Gwydonius (quoth he) how art thou combred
with diuers cogitations, what a cruell conflict dost
thou sinde in thy minde betwéene loue and loyaltie, nature
&amp; necessitie? who euer was so wilfull, as willingly
to wage battaile against his owne father? who so cruell
as to enter combat with his owne sire? Alas, duetie perswades
me not to practise so monstrous a mischiefe: but
the deuotion I owe to Castania driues me to perfourme
the déede, were it thrice more daungerous or desperate.
The honour I owe to my Father makes me faynt for
feare, but once to imagine so brutish a fact: the loue I
owe to Castania constrayneth me to defende the combat
if Iupiter himselfe made the challenge. And is not (fond
foole) necessitie aboue nature, is not the lawe of loue aboue
King or Keyzar, Father or Friends, God or the
Diuell? Yes. And so I meane to take it: for either I
wil valiantly win the conquest and my Castania, or lose

the victorie, and so by death ende my miseries.
            With that the trumpets sounded, and Gwydonius
lustely leaping into the lystes, fell presentlye into furyous
fight with his father, driuing not onely Fernandus
&amp; Orlanio, but also both the armies into a great doubt,
for although Clerophontes most cruelly prosecuted him,
yet he alwaies receiued the strokes, but neuer so much
as once returned one blow, till at last looking aloft, and
spying Castania, his courage so increased, that all feare
set aside, he carelessely flang away his sword and shield
and ranne vpon his Father, not onely tearing from him
his target, but vyolently casting him vpon the ground,
and spéedely vnlacing his Helmet, offered to cut off his
head with his owne sword: but Clerophontes crying
out confessed himselfe captiue, and granted his enimie
the conquest. Wherevpon they of Alexandria, gaue a
mightie showte, and Fernandus and Orlanio came down
readie to carrie Clerophontes captiue to the Citie. But
Gwydoni
                     •
                  s▪
                first demaunded of Orlanio if hée was content
to perfourme that which he promised by proclamation,
to whom Fernandu
                     •
                  
                aunswered that both he would
and should or els as he was his friend so he woulde bee
his foe. Gwydonius hearing this faithfull assertion of
the King, pulling downe his beauer, began to speake in
this manner.
            I Let thée Orlanio (quoth he) and the worthie king
of Bohemia to knowe, that I am Gwydonius, sonne
and heire to this conquered Clerophontes, who for the
loue of thy Daughter Castania haue not spared contrarie
to the lawe of nature, to fight with mine owne Father,
hoping the destinies by my meanes haue decréed,
not onely of fatall foes to make you faithfull friendes,
but to finish vp our loue, which otherwise coulde not
haue bene perfourmed.
            
               
I haue wonne Orlanio my Fathers Dukedome by victorie,
and thy Daughter by conquest, the one I had before
by inheritaunce and the other by loue, yet I wold
willingly haue thy good will, which if thou graunt, I
hope my father will both pardon my offence and thinke
well of my proffer.
            
               Clerophontes kissing and imbracing Gwydonius,
tolde him his care was halfe cured, in that such a good
Captaine had wonne the Conquest. Fernandus &amp; Orlanio
stood astonished at this strange Tragedie, doubting
in whether they dreampt of such a rare deuice, or saw it
effect. At last Orlanio as one wakened out of a traunce,
with trickeling teares imbraced Clerophontes, honouring
him as his Soueraigne, and promising not onely
to giue Castania to Gwydonius, but also halfe his
Dukedome in dowrie. Clerophontes thanking him
for his curtesie, consented most willingly to this
motion, so that before Fernandus departed,
the marriage betwéen Gwydonius and
Castania, Thersandro and Lewcippa,
was most sumptuously
solemnized.

auoucheth that of right shee ought to bee the formost.
Wherevpon they enter into disputation of their power,
dignitie and superioritie. But Loue not able to get the cō

               I Feare greatly that I shall be the last at the Feast
of Iupiter, where all the Gods no doubt doo attend
mée. And yet me think I sée the Sonne of Venus which
is as late as 
                     •
                  . I will pass
                     •
                   before him, least they call

me sluggish and sloathfull.
            
            
               Loue.
               WHat foole is this that repulseth me so rudely? take
heede least hast make wast, and that thy rashnesse
cause thée not cry Peccaui.
               
            
            
               Folly.
               Oh sir, blame me not though I make hast, for I goe
before to tell the Gods, that you come at leasure.
            
            
               Loue.
               Nay, that which is easely begun, is not alwaies lightly
ended: for before thou escape me, I will reuenge this
thy iniurious iesting.
            
            
               Folly.
               Let me goe fond Loue and stay me not, for as it is
a shame to quarrell with a woman, so it is more discredit
to take the foyle.
            
            
               Loue.
               The foyle. What boasting brags be these? who hath
euer aduentured to despise mée, much lesse to defie mée?
But doost thou know what I am.
            
            
               Folly.
               Thou art Cupid the Sonne of Venus.
               
            
            
               Loue.
               How darest thou then vaunt thy selfe against mée,
which how little so euer I be, am the most redoubted of
all the Gods.
            
            
               Folly.
               Thy words are great whatsoeuer thy workes be, but
tell me, what or wherein lyeth this thy great power.
            
            
               Loue.
               The heauens and the earth fonde foole are witnesses
of my words, there is no place where I haue not lefte
Trophées in signe of triu
                     •
                  ph. Looke into heauen, and

demaund if any of the Gods haue escaped my handes?
Begin with olde Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Apollo, and end
with the Demigods, Satyres, Fawnes, and Siluanes:
Nay, the Goddesses themselues will not shame to confesse
somewhat. Looke vpon the earth, and sée if thou
canst find one, which hath not ben foyled by my means.
Behold in the furious Seas, how Neptune and his Tritons
doo yéelde me obeysaunce. Yea, and lastly looke into
Hell it selfe, if I haue not forced Pluto that infernall
Prince, to steale awaye Proserpina the daughter of Ceres.
And to the ende, thou doubt not with what engines
I haue atchieued these victories, behold this Bowe and
these Arrowes onely, which haue wonne mée these worthie
Conquests. I haue no néede that Vulcan doo temper
my tooles. I am not accompanied with the Furyes
and Harpies, to cause me to be feared before the Combat.
I haue not to doo with Charyots, Souldiours, Captaines,
men of armes, nor great troupes of Horsemen,
without the which mortall men cannot triumph. No,
I haue no other counsaile, munition, nor ayde, but
my selfe. When I sée mine enimyes in the Fielde,
I present my selfe with my Bowe, and lette flye my
Boltes, and the victorye is alwayes gotten at the first
stroke.
            
            
               Folly.
               I excuse thy youthfull yeares poore Cupid, or else
I woulde blaze thée for the most presumptuous patche
in the worlde. It séemeth by thy vaine vaunting that
euerye one holdeth his lyfe of thy mercie, and that thou
art the onelye Lorde and Soueraygne both in Heauen,
Earth, the Sea, and Hell. But manie things are
spoken which are neuer beléeued.
            
            
               
               Loue.
               And art thou so hard of beléefe, to denie that which
euery one confesseth.
            
            
               Folly.
               I haue not to doo with other mens opinions: but
this I am sure, that it is not by thy force and prowesse,
that so many myracles are wrought in the worlde, but
by my industrie, by my meanes, and by my diligence,
although thou knowest me not. But if thou doost continue
long in this thy choller, I will let thée vnderstand
that thy bowe and thy arrowes whereof thou vauntest
so much, are more weake than waxe, if I bende not the
one, and temper the other.
            
            
               Loue.
               Doost thou thinke by this scoffing to pacifie myne
anger, or by contemptuous threatening to quallyfie my
choller. Hast thou euer (fonde foole) handled my bowe,
or directed my boltes? Is it thy prowesse and not my
force which perfourmeth such valyaunt Conquestes?
But since thou regardest me and respectest my force so
little, thou shalt presently féele the proofe thereof.
            
            Folly maketh hir selfe inuisible, so that
Loue cannot hit her.
            
               Loue.
               But where art thou become? How hast thou escaped
me? This onely is the straungest case that euer
chaunced vnto me. I had thought that amongst all the
Gods I onely could haue made my selfe inuisible. But
now I sée I am deceiued.
            
            
               Folly.
               Did not I tell thée before, that thy bowe and thy arrowes
are of no force, but when it pleaseth me, and that

by my meanes thou alwayes obtainest the conquest.
Meruaile not if I be inuisible, for if I list the eyes of the
Eagle or of the Serpent of Epidawrus, cannot espie me,
for Camelion like I take the shape of them with whom
I doe remaine.
            
            
               Loue.
               Truely as I coniecture thou art some Sorceresse, or
some Inchauntresse, some Circe, some Medea, or some
Fayrie.
            
            
               Folly.
               Well, since thou doest thus recklesly raile vpon mée,
know that I am a goddesse as thou art a God, my name
is folly: I am she which raiseth thée vp, and casteth thee
downe at my pleasure. Thou vnloosest thy bowe, and
lettest flie thine arrowes in the aire, but I place them
where it pleaseth me. Thou doest addresse thy selfe against
Iupiter, but he is of such puissaunce, that if I both
guided not thy
                     •
                   hand, and tempered thy arrow, thy feeble
force could little preuaile against his prowesse. Indeede
yu didst force Iup
                        •
                     ter to loue, but I caused him to change
himselfe into a Swanne, into a Bull, into Golde, into
an Eagle. Who caused Mars and thy mother Venus to
bée taken in bed together by the limping cuckolde Vulcan,
but I? If Paris had done no other thing but loued
Helena, Sparta had neuer reioyced, nor Troy ben brought
to ruine. But did not I cause him to goe to Menelaus
vnder coulour of Embassage, to Court vnto his wife to
leade her awaie by force, and after to defend his vniust
quarrel against all Greece? Who had spoken of the loue
of Dido, if he had not deuised to goe a hunting, that she
might haue the better commoditie to communicate with
Aeneas, that by such priuate familiaritie he might not be
ashamed to take from her that which long before most
willingly she would haue giuen him. I beléeue no mention
had béene made of Artemizia, if I had not caused

her drinke the cynders of her husbands dead carcasse, for
else who had knowen whether she had loued her husband
more then other women. The effect and issues of
things alwayes make them to be praised or dispraised.
If thou makest men to loue, yet I am oft times the
chiefest cause. But if any straunge aduenture or greate
effect chaunceth, in that thou hast no part, but the onely
honour belongeth vnto me. Thou rulest nothing but y•
heart, the rest I gouerne: yea, I leade thée, I conducte
thée, and thine eyes serue thée to no more vse then the
beames of the Sunne to a blinde man. But to the ende
thou knowe mée from hence foorth, and that thou mayst
giue mée thankes for conducting thée carefullye:
Beholde nowe howe greatlye thine eyes dooe profite
thée.
            
            Follie putteth out Cupids eies.
            
               Loue.
               Alasse Iupiter, O my mother Venus, what auayleth
it to bée thy sonne so feared, so redoubted, both in heauen
and in earth, if I be subiect to bée iniured as the most
vile slaue in the worlde: Alasse, haue I thus lost mine
eies by an vnknowen woman.
            
            
               Folly.
               Take héede sond foole another time to rayle vppon
those who perhappes are of more force and puissaunce
then thou. Thou hast offended the Quéene of men, thou
hast outraged her who gouerneth the heart, the braine,
and the minde: Under whose shadowe euerie one once
in his lyfe shroudeth himselfe, and ther remaineth either
long or short time according to his merite, thou hast displeased
her who procureth thy renowme, thou hast contempned
her who hath aduaunced thée, and therfore hath

this misfortune fallen vpon thy head.
            
            
               Loue.
               Alasse, how is it possible for me to 
                     〈◊〉
                   her whom
I neuer knew, or to reuerence that person whom before
I neuer sawe: but if thou hast borne me such great good
will as thou saist, pardon this my offence, and restore me
my sight.
            
            
               Folly.
               To restore thée thine eyes is not in my power, but I
will couer the place to hide the deformitie.
            
            Folly couereth Cupids face with a
Scarfe, and giueth him wings.
            And in liew of this haplesse lucke, thou shalt haue
these wings which shal cary thée whether thou wilt wish
            
               Loue.
               But where hadst thou this vaile so readie to couer my
deformitie.
            
            
               Folly.
               It was giuen me as I came hether, by one of the destinies,
who told me it was of that nature, that if it were
once fastned, it could neuer be vnloosed.
            
            
               Loue.
               How vnloosed? am I then blinde for euer? O vile and
traiterous wretch, coulde it not suffice to pull out mine
eyes, but to take awaie the meanes, that the Gods cannot
restore them, now I sée the sentence verified on my
selfe, that it is not good to take a present at the hande of
an enimie. O cruell destinies, O cursed daie: shall not
the heauens, the earth, and the seas haue cause to waile,
sith loue is blinde. But why doe I complaine héere in
vaine, it is better for me to sue to the Gods for reuengement.
            
            
               
               The second discourse.
               Loue goe
                     ••
                   from the Pallace of Iupiter, lamenting
to himselfe his mischiefe.
               
                  Loue.
                  Alasse in what miserable case am I, what can eyther my
bowe or mine arrowes auaile me, nowe can I not cause
whom I 
                        〈…〉

                     oue, but without respect of persons, euerie
one is in daunger of my darts. Hetherto I haue onely
caused daintie damsells and young youths to loue, I
did choose out the brauest blouds, and the fairest and most
well featured men: I did pardon vile and base persons,
I excused the deformed creatures, and let olde age remaine
in peace. But now thi
                        •
                     king to hit a young gallaunt,
I light vpon some olde 
                        •••
                     ting lecher: in stéed of
some braue Gentleman, I strike some filthie foule lurden.
And it shall happen (I d
                        ••
                     bt) that they shall bée
most fortunate in their loue, so that by patrimonie, presence,
or wealth, they shall soonest winne the fauour of
women, and by this meanes my kingdome shall come to
ruine, when men sée in it such disorder and euill gouernment.
               
               Venus hauing long sought Cupid,
now meeteth him.
               
                  I haue carefully long sought thée my deare sonne, meruailing
what the cause shoulde bée that thou hast
not bene present at the banket of Iupiter. Who is greatly
incensed against thee, not onely for thy absence, but for
the complaintes which are 
                        〈◊〉
                      out against thée by
sundrie poore artificers, labouring men, pesaunts, slaues,
hand maides, olde men, and toothlesse aged women, crying
all vnto Iupiter, that they loue, thinking themselues
greatly iniured in this respect, that the passion which is

proper to worthy and noble men, should be inflicted vpon
them which are of the base and vildest sort.
               
               
                  Loue.
                  Had not the great misfortune which is chaunced vnto
me happened, I had neither bene absent from the banquet,
nor these gréeuous complaints had not bene inferred
against mée.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Why? and art thou hurt? Who hath thus vailed
thine eies.
               
               
                  Loue.
                  
                     Folly hath not onely pulled them out, but also hath put
this bande before mine eies, which can neuer be taken away.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  O cursed enimie of all wisedome, O haplesse wretch,
vniustly called a Goddesse, and more vnrightly tearmed
immortall, hast thou depriued me of my chiefest delight
and felicitie. O disaster loue, O dissolute mother, O wofull
Venus. who séest thy sonne, thy ioy, and onely care,
thus cruelly depriued of his sight. Well, since thy mishap
is so great, I vowe that euerie one that shall loue (what
fauour or happie successe so euer he shall haue) shall not
be without some care, trouble, or calamitie, that hée
vaunt not himselfe to be more happie then the sonne
of Venus.
                  
               
               
                  Loue.
                  Cease off good mother from these sorrowfull complaints,
&amp; redouble not my griefe by these your dolorous
discourses, suffer mée to beare mine owne misfortune,
and wish not euill vnto them which shall bée my subiectes.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Well, let vs then goe to Iupiter, and complaine of this
cursed inchauntresse.
               
            
            
               The third discourse.
               
                  
                  Venus.
                  If euer thou hadst pittie of my plaintes, most iust
Iupiter, when thou sawest me labour to saue my son
Aeneas from the furie of the raging Seas, and to defend
him from other daungers, in the which he was present
at the siege of Troy. If my teares for the death of my
deare Adonis moued thée to compassion. The surpassing
sorrow that I doe conceiue for the great iniurie offered
to Cupid, I hope shall moue thée to pittie. If teares wold
suffer me I would bewraie the cause of my sorrow, but
behold my sonne in what plight he is, and thou shalt easily
perceiue the cause of my complaint.
               
               
                  Iupiter.
                  Alasse my deare daughter, what doe these teares preuaile,
knowest thou not what fatherly affection I haue
alwaies borne thée, what doest thou distrust that I wyll
not succour thée, or that I cannot.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  No, I neither doubt the one, nor distrust the other, I
onely demaund iustice against Folly, the most outragious
furie in the world, which hath thus grieuously abused
Cupid.
                  
               
               
                  Folly.
                  Most mightie and soueraigne Iupiter, beholde I am
héere readie to answere to Venus complaints, and to debate
my right against Cupid.
                  
               
               
                  Iupiter.
                  
                     Folly, I will neither accuse nor excuse thée, vntill I
haue heard the defence of the one, as well as the plaint of
the other, least I should be thought parciall, neither for
the more auoiding of iniustice in the matter, wil I suffer
you to plead your owne causes, but Venus choose you one
of the Gods, and Folly take you an other.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  I choose Appollo to defend my cause.
               
               
                  
                  Folly.
                  And I Mercurie to maintaine my right.
               
               
                  Iupiter.
                  Then Apollo &amp; Mercurie, prepare your selues to plead
well in your clients cases, and Apollo since you take the
plaintiefes part, let vs heare what you can say.
               
               
                  Apollo.
                  THe common people, right soueraigne Iupiter (although
their minds be sotted &amp; almost sēceles, yet they haue al
way had loue in such sacred estimation, y• they haue carefully
rewarded thē wt the titles of honor &amp; dignity, which
haue excelled in y• holy affection, estéeming this only vertue
(if so rightly it may be tearmed) sufficient of a mā to
make one a God. The Scithians for this cause canonized
Pilades &amp; Orestes, erecting temples vnto thē, &amp; calling thē
the Gods of amitie. Castor &amp; Pollux were made immortal
by this meanes, not in y• they were brothers, but in y•
(which is rare) their loue was inuiolable. Howe hath
fame blazed abroad y• loue of Dauid &amp; Ionathas, y• amitie
of Pithias &amp; Damon, &amp; of Titus &amp; Gysippus. But y• better
to make manifest y• force of loue &amp; amitie, I will alledge
the saying of Darius, who opening a Pomgranat, being
demanded wherof he would haue as many as ther were
graines within, answered, of Zopyres: this Zopyre was
his faithful friend, by the meanes of whom he conquered
Babylon. I remember also a certaine Syrian demanding
a maide in marriage, and being willed to shew of what
wealth he was, said that he had no other riches but two
friends, estéeming himself rich inough with such possessions
to craue y• daughter of a great lord in mariage. Did
not loue cause Ariadne saue Theseus life, Hyperminestra
redéeme Linceus frō danger, &amp; Medea frée Iason from perill?
Haue not many poore soldiers ben aduanced to high
dignities by y• meanes of loue? yea, doth not all pleasure
&amp; profit procéed to man by loue, causing him to looke wt an

amiable countenance, to speake pleasantly, and to be curious
in his ieastures, although by nature he be dull, sottish,
&amp; of a fierce looke. What causeth a man to go braue &amp;
fine in his apparell, séeking euerie day new fashions, but
loue? What procureth Gentlewomen to haue their haire
frizeled, crisped, and embrodered with golde, to be dressed
after the Spanish, French, or Italian fashion, but Loue.
Painting their faces if they be foule, with liuely colours.
But if they be faire, they so carfully kéepe their beautie
from the parching heate of Summer, from the chilling
colde of Winter, from Wine, raine, and age, as they remaine
almost euer young, not so much as forgetting to
haue their shooes made fine and neate (because the curiousnesse
of men is such, as they leaue not to looke from
the crowne of the head to the soale of the foote) to haue
their iemmes, iewells, ouches, ringes, perfumed gloues,
and what not? In fine, what beautie or brauerie is in
the apparell eyther of man or woman, all proceedeth of
Loue. Shall I saie that Musicke was onely inuented
by loue, yea truely, for eyther it mittigateth the passions
wherewith men are perplexed, or else augmenteth their
pleasure, so that dayly they inuent diuerse kindes of instrumentes,
as Lutes, Citrons, Uiolls, Flutes, Cornets,
Bandoras, whereon they plaie Madrigalis, Sonnettes,
Pauins, Measures, Galiardes, and all these in remembraunce
of Loue, as he for whom men doe more then for
anie other. What causeth men to iust, tourney, runne at
tilt, and combat, but loue? Who caused Comedies, shews,
Tragedies and Masks to be inuented, but Loue. Wherof
commeth it that men delight to rehearse their amorous
chaunces and straunge passions, and to relate them
to their companions: some praising the courtesie of his
Ladie, another condempning his mistresse crueltie:
yea, recounting a thousande mishappes which happen
in theyr loues: as Letters disclosed, euyll reportes,

suspitious iealousie, sometimes the husband comming
home sooner, than either the louer would, or the wife doeth
wish: sometimes coniecturing without cause, and
other times beléeuing nothing, but trusting vppon hys
wiues honestie. To be short, the greatest pleasure after
loue, is to tell what perillous daungers are passed. But
what maketh so many Poets in the worlde, is it not
Loue? the which séemeth to be the plaine song whereon
all Poets doo descant: yea, there is few which write vppon
any serious matter, but they close vp their worke
with some amorous clause, or els they are the worse accepted.
Ouid hath celebrated the fame of Cupid, Petracke
and Virgil, Homere and Liu
                           •
                        us, Sapho, yea &amp; that
seuere Socrates wrote somewhat of his loue Aspasia.
                  
                  Tush, who rightly can denye, that Loue is not the cause
of all the glorie, honour, profite and pleasure which happeneth
to man, and that without it he cannot conuenientlye
lyue, but shall runne into a thousande enormities.
                  All this happie successe came by Loue, as long as hée
had his eyes, but now being depriued of his sight, and
accompanied with▪ Folly, it is to be feared, nay certainly
to be beléeued, that he shall be the cause of as manie
discommodities, mischiefes and mishaps, as hethertoo hée
hath bene of honour, profit, and pleasure. The noble men
which loued their inferiours, and the subiects which dutifully
serued their Lords, shall be meruailously chaunged
by the meanes of folly, for the master shall loue his
seruaunt onely for his seruice, and the seruaunt his master
onely for commoditie. Yea, there is none so addicted
vnto vertue, but if once he loue, he shall presently commit
some foolish touch: and the more straight and firme
loue is, the greater disorder there shall be by the meanes
of Folly. There will returne into the world more then
one Biblis, more then one Semyramis, then one Myrrha,
                     
then one Canace, then one Phaedra. There shall be no
place in the world vnspotted. The high walls and tre
                        •
                     
                     lissed
windowes, shall not kéepe the Nunnes and Uestall
Uirgins in sauegard. Olde age shall tourne her aged
affections into fond fancies and wanton desires.
                  Shame shall lyue as an exile. There shall be no difference
betwéene the Noble and the pesaunt, betwéene the
Infidell and the Moore, the Turke and the Iewe, the
Ladie, the Mistresse and the hand-maide. But ther shall
insue such a confused inequalitie, that the faire shal not
be matched with the wel featured, but shal be oft times
ioyned with fowle and deformed persons Great Ladies
and noble Dames shall fall in loue with them whome
before they would disdaine to accept as their seruants.
And when the loyall and faithfull Louers, haue long
languished in the loue of some beautifull Dame, whose
mutuall good will they haue gayned by deserte: then
Folly will cause some fickle &amp; false flatterer, to enioye
that in one hower, which in all their life they coulde not
attayne. I passe ouer the continuall debates and quarrells
that shall ensue by Folly, whereof shall spring
woundes, massacres, and most fearefull murthers. And
I greatly feare that wheras Loue hath inuented so many
laudable sciences, and brought foorth so many commodities,
that now he will bring great idlenesse accompanied
with ignoraunce, that he will cause young Gentlemen
to leaue feates of armes, to forsake the seruice
of their Prince, to reiect honourable studyes, and to
appplye them selues to vaine songs and sonnets, to
chambring and wantonnesse, to banketting and gluttonie,
bringing infinite diseases to their bodies, and sundrie
daungers and perills to their persons, for there is
no more daungerous companie than of Folly.
                  Behold O souereigne Iupiter the mischiefes and miseries

that are like to insue, if Folly be appointed companion
to Loue. Wherefore I in the person of all the
Gods beséech, your Maiestie to graunt that Loue maye
not be ioyned with her, and that Folly may gréeuously
be punished for the outrage she hath done to Cupid.
                  
               
               As soone as Apollo had ended his Oration, Mercurie
in defence of Folly beginneth to speake
in this wise.
               
                  Mercurie.
                  WHereas (right worthie Iupiter) Apollo hath with
his painted eloquence set out the praises of Loue,
and hath sought with his filed phrases to discredit Folly,
I hope when your Maiestie shall throughlye heare
the cause decyded, you will commende his Eloquence,
more than his reasons. For it is not vnknowen vnto
you and all the Gods, that Folly is no whit inferiour
vnto Loue, and that Loue should be of no force without
her, neyther could his kingdom indure without her help,
ayde and counsayle. I praye you call to remembraunce
how Folly incontinently after Man was placed in Paradise,
beganne most imperiously to rule, and hath euer
since continued in such credite, as neuer any Goddesse
had the like, raigning and ruling amongest men, from
time to time, from age to age, as the onely Princesse of
the worlde. Insomuch that who haue bene more honored
than fooles. Who was more subiect vnto Folly, than
Alexander the great. which féeling himselfe to suffer
hunger and thirst, to be subiect to sorrow and sicknesse,
not able to kéepe himselfe from dronkennesse, yet would
be honoured for a God.
                  
                     What kinde of people hath bene in greater credit than
Philosophers, and who more fooles? Did not Aristotle
most foolishly dye for sorrowe, because he knewe not the
ebbing and flowing of the sea? Did not Crates in casting
his treasure into the sea, commit a wise déede? What
folly shewed Empedocles, by his straunge coniectures?
what say you to Diogenes tunne, and to Aristippus flatterie?
Who so throughly considereth their opinions, shal
finde them subiect to the state of Folly. How many other
sciences are there in the world, which are altogether foolish,
and yet the professors of them had in high reputation
amongest men. They which are Calculators
of Natiuities, makers of charecters, casters of figures,
are they not Friers of this fraternitie. Is it not Folly
to be so curious, as to measure the heauen, the height of
the starres, the breadth of the earth, and the deapth of the
sea, and yet the professors heereof are highly estéemed, &amp;
onely by the meanes of Folly. Nay, how could y• world
continue, if the daungers, troubles, calamities and discommodities
of mariage, were not couered by folly.
                  Who would haue coasted the seas if Folly had not ben
his guide? to commit himselfe to the mercie of y• winde
the waues, to liue in daunger of fearefull surges, and
and perillous Rockes, to trafficke with sauage and barbarous
people, onely incensed by the meanes of Folly.
And yet notwithstanding by this meanes the common
wealth is maintained, knowledge and learning
augmented, the properties of hearbes, stones, and birdes
beastes, perfectly searched out. What Follye is it most
daungerously to passe into the bowels of ye earth to dig
for yron, and seeke for golde? How many Arts and occupations
shuld be driuen out of the world, if Folly were
banished? truly the most part of men should either beg
for want, or dye for hunger. How should so many Aduocates,
Procurators, Sergeaunts, Atturneyes, Scriueners,

Imbroderers, Painters, and Perfumers liue, if
Lady Folly were vtterlye exiled. Hath not Folly inuented
a thousand deuices to drawe a man from idlenesse,
as Tragedies, Comedies, Dauncing schooles, Fencing
houses, wrastling places, and a thousand other foolish
sports.
                  Hath she not made men hardie &amp; venterous to fight
with Lyons, Boares &amp; Bulles, onely to gaine honour, &amp;
to passe other in folly. What did Antonie and Cleopapatra
when they straue who should spend most in beastly
banketting? What caused Caesar lament that he had
not begun to trouble the world
                        •
                     in that age, wherin Alexander
had conquered the greatest part? Why did diuers
séeke to fill vp the valleyes, to make plaine the
mountaines, to drye vp riuers, to make bridges ouer the
sea, as Claudius the Emperour did? What made Rhodope
build the Pyramides, and Artemisia frame the
sumptuous sepulcher? but Folly. In fine, without this
Goddesse man should be carefull, heauie, and whollye
drowned in sorrow: whereas Folly quickeneth his spirite,
maketh him sing, daunce, leape, and frame himselfe
altogether to pleasure. It is not possible that Loue shuld
be without the daughter of youth, which is Folly. For
Loue springeth of sodaine and sundry causes, by receyuing
an Apple, as Cydippe: by looking out at a Windowe,
as Scylla: by reading in a Booke, as the Ladye
Frauncis Rymhi: some fall in loue by sight, some by hearing,
but all liuing in hope to obtane their desires. And
yet some haue loued without anye naturall cause, as
Pigmalion, who fell in Loue with his marble picture, &amp;
I pray you what Sympathia could there be betweene a
lyuely youth, and a dead stone, what was it then but
Folly that kindled this flame? what forced Narcissus to
fall in Loue with his owne shadowe, but Folly. Yea,
what aduenture is passed in loue without Folly.
                  
                     
For the Philosophers define Folly to be a depriuation
of Wisedome, and Wisedome is altogether without
passions: of the which when Loue shall be voyde, then
no doubt the sea shall be without waues, and the Fire
without heate.
                  Consider but a young man which onely placeth his
delight in amorous conceiptes, decking, dressing, and
perfuming himselfe most delicately, who passeth out of
his lodging, fraught with a thousand sundry fancies, accompanied
with men and pages, passing to the place
where he may haue a sight of his Mistres, obtaining for
his trauell no gain but perhaps some amorous glaunce,
making long sutes, spending his time and his treasure,
consuming his wit, and wasting his wealth, and yet
reaping nothing but disdaine and discredite. But if it
chaunce that his Mistresse condiscend vnto his requests,
she appoynteth him to come at some suspitious houre,
which he cannot performe without great perill. To come
with companie, were to bewray his secrets: to go alone,
most daungerous: to goe openly, too manifest: so that
he must passe disguised, sometime like a woman, other
times like a peasant or some vilde person, scaling the
walles with ladders, clyming vp to the windowes by
cordes: yea, continually in daunger of death, if Follye
did not holde him vp by the hand. It is not also vnknowen
vnto you how manye sundrye passions doo perplexe
the poore passionate Louers, all which procéede of
Folly, as to haue ones heart seperated from himselfe, to
be nowe in peace and than in warre, now couering his
dolour, blushing one while and looking pale another,
fraught wholly with feare, hope and shame, séeking that
carefully which he séemeth to flie, &amp; yet doubtfully dreading
not to find it, to laugh seldome, to sigh often, to burn
in cold, &amp; fréeze in heate, to be crossed altogether wt cōtraries,

which be signs not only of folly but of phrēsie. Who
shall excuse Hercules, handling so carefully the distaffe of
Omphale, or Salomon for combring himselfe with so many
Concubines, Annibal in submitting himselfe to his
loue, Aristotle in obeying Hermia, and Socrates in yéelding
to Aspasia, and many other which we sée daily to be
so blinded, as they knowe not themselues, and what is
the cause héereof but folly, so that we sée that it is she
which maketh loue to be so feared &amp; 
                        ••
                     doubted, it is shée
that honoureth him, exalteth his name, and causeth him
to be counted as a God. Further, whosoeuer loueth must
applie himselfe to the affection of his mistresse, although
it be contrarie to his natural constitution, if he be quiet,
wise and discréete, yet if his louer please to haue him
chaunge his state, he must turne his stearn and hoise his
saile to goe with another winde, Zethius and Amphion
could not agrée, for because the delight of the one was a
despight to the other, vntill Amphion left his musicke.
If the Lady whom thou louest be couetous, thou must
chaunge thy selfe into golde, and so fall into her bosome,
if she be merrie, thou must be pleasaunt, if sullen, thou
must be sad. All the seruauntes and sutors to Atlanta
were hunters, because she delighted in that sport. Many
Gentlewomen to please their louers which were Poets,
left the rocke and the néedle, and tooke in hand pens and
bookes: now tell me if these straunge Metamorphosis be
not méere pointes of folly? Doe you thinke that a souldier
which goeth to the assalt, marketh ye trenches, thinketh
of his enimies, or of a thousande harguebushes,
wherof euerie one is sufficient to destroy him? No, he only
hopeth to win the conquest, and doth not so much as
once imagine the rest. He which first inuented sailing,
doubted not of the perillous daungers: and he that playeth,
neuer thinketh to become a looser, yet are they all
thrée in daunger to be slaine, drowned, and vndoone. But

whether she séemeth best, and for the restoring of his

it shall be decréed.
