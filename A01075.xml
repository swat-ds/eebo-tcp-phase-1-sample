            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            LONDON, Printed for Iohn Bill. 1606.
         
         
            
            
            To the Reader.
            
               THe Commonweale with all her parts,The aptest resemblances of a Commonweale. orders, qualities, and requisites whatsoeuer, is (for better apprehension &amp; illustration) set forth by sundry fit resemblances, as by the architecture of an house, by the swarming and cohabiting of Bees in an hiue, by a ship floating on the sea, and such like; but by none more properly than eyther by the vniuersall masse of the whole world, (consisting of all the seuerall subsistances in that great frame by the high wisdome and might of God compact and vnited) or else by the body of man, being the lesser world,The greater and lesser world. euen the diminitiue and modell of that wide extending vniuersall. And (by the way) it were a paynes well bestowed, to obserue the good correspondence betweene euery the particular parts or faculties in man, and the other distinct parts, powers, and operations of that bigger bulke: which seemeth to haue beene both sweetly and soundly conceaued by that thrice renowmed Philosopher Trismegistus,
               Trismegistus his great Giant. when he imagined an huge and mightie Gyant, whose head was aboue



the firmament, his necke, shoulders, and vpper parts in the heauens, his armes and hands reaching to East and West, his belly in the whole spaciousnesse vnder the Moone, his legges and feet within the earth. But for that the discourse or discouery of this secret, with the agreeable references to arise therof, falleth not within the line wherwith I haue listed and bounded this Treatise; I wil only from this obseruation of Gods owne imitating of himselfe in the likenesse of the lesse with the greater,Gods imitating of himselfe, a direction for our imitating of him gather and infer that which giueth groundworke vnto my purpose: That the incōprehensible wisdome of God, in the composing &amp; ordering of his works in nature, hath so dignified them with all perfection, as that they be left vnto vs as eminent and exemplary patterns, as well for the consolidating, as for the beautifying of that wee worke by arte or policie; as well for conioyning of all discordances into firmenesse, as also for the applyablenesse of particulars in their many seruices, for the vse and benifit of the whole. It is beyond the compasse of any contradiction, that in the morall vertues Christes actions are our instructions; and no lesse may the like rule hold, that in the contriuing of a prudent gouernment, the impressions and footsteps of Gods wisdome (which in things naturall wee contemplate by study) be in the poynt of regiment, our directories for imitation. Wherefore seeing that the vttermost extent of mans vnderstanding, can shape no better forme of ordering the affayres of a State, than by marking and matching of the workes of the finger of God, eyther in the larger volume of the vniuersall, or in the abridgement thereof, the body of man: I account these two to be the two great lights for enquiry and meditation concerning this businesse, and doe worthily omit all other worthlesse presidents, as inferiour starrelights, which oftentimes seduceth



by their dimnesse, and at their best are but deriuatiue and subalterne vnto these. And of these two also (as not daring to gaze too much vpon the Sunne,Man the fittest patterne to imitate in the forming of a ciuill state. and vnable in mine own weakenesse to run the round of such a large cōpasse) I haue made my choyce to pursue only those applyances, which from the so skilfull workemanship of God in man, may bee well apted to the ciuill gouernment of the assemblies of men: which being of more facilitie to bee vnderstood (as deduced from a more familiar example) and equalling the other both in dignitie (hauing the same authour) and in certayntie (respecting the fitnesse of their relation) may also sort both agreeably with other mens likings (as bred in their bosomes) and with mine intentions, which seeketh wholy a demonstratiue plainenesse.
            This similitude was both fitly and fortunatly enforced by Menenius Agrippa,
               Agrippa his tale of the parts of the body. Liuius lib. 2.
                who being imployed in the appeasing and persuading of the seditious reuoulting commons of Rome, did by a very tale of this proportionable respectiuenes of the parts in mans body, and the mutualitie of kindnes and ayd afforded from each to other, so sensibly shew them their errour, that surseasing their malignant enuy wherewith they were inraged against their rulers (whom they accounted as the idle belly that swallowed the labors of their hands) they discerned at the last, that their repining against, and their pining of that belly, whence was distributed vnto them their bloud and nourishment, necessarily tended to their owne destruction; and were thereuppon forthwith reclaymed into their bounds of obedience. The like comparison is most diuinely enlarged by a much better Orator,The like comparisons vsed in the scriptures. 1. Cor. 12.
                and in a much more important poynt of the vnseparable vnion of the members of Christ with their head, and of the necessary communion of their distinct gifts and works amongst



themselues; yea, it hath pleased God himselfe for the manifestation in some measure of his vnmeasurable infinitenesse, &amp; the incomprehensible nature of his dietie, to vouchsafe vnto vs as it were some glimse thereof, by this selfe same well agreeing semblance, drawne and borrowed from our weak, mortall, and sinfull bodies. His omni-science is set forth by an all-seeing eye, his omnipotencie by a mightie and outstretched arme, his mercy by the cheerefulnesse of a louing countenance, his bountie by the opening of his hand, and filling of all things with his blessings: by which so apt tipes he openeth for our more easie vnderstanding, the profoundnesse of his attributes, and (as I may say) the mysteries of his essence.
            I need not spend any speech in the praise of such familiar and well pleasing illustrations:In praise of such comparisons. looke but vpon that exsuperant and not attainable by humane powers wisdome of Salomon, is not the brightest apparance thereof in comparatiue parables? but behold a greater than Salomon, who without parables spake nothing to them; as if both the depth and delicacie of wits inuention for either prouing or persuading, consisted chiefely in such equipolling and Parabolicall applications. It remayneth that before I proceed to the producing or presenting vpon the Stage of State the similitudes themselues, to be scanned and considered of, (which I wish may proue themselues right paralele) I do for aduantage enterline first a Caution, then a Limitation: My Caution is,A Caution against crossing with dissimilitudes. That no man in streyning too hard, do force the bloud, where he is offered milke. It is easie for a curious obiector, euen in the fittest comparisons to make disseuerance by inferring different respects and inequallitie. The dissimilitudes of things be infinite, and rometh with errour in the circumference, where the well apted likenesse setleth in



the center of truth, and is compacted closely in one onely point of good congruitie, from the which it may neither be drawne awry without wrongfull wresting, nor enlarged too far without extreame torturing. It is the greatest miracle of Gods powerfull wisdome, in the innumerable formes of things, to make so infinite variation; Then it must needs be a great worke of the wit of man, in such multiplicitie of disference to find out the well agreeing semblances, To knit and match together sundry things by an aptnesse of application, is the proper effect of vnion; but to disioyne the well coupled from their louely analogie of each to other, is a violent diuorce and distraction: Therefore let such makebates (if any be) abate their humor of crossing with dissimilitudes, &amp; content their conceits with that which they shall discerne to be matched with a right mirror, and representingly expressed by the shew of a good concordance.
            My Limitation is,A limitation not to striue too far. That it be not exacted or expected of me, so mincingly to manage this matter, as that vnto euery particuler part or facultie of our humane nature, I must needs find out in the States bodie some seuerall members or braunches entirely matchable to the same; like a picture to be newly drawne by a former patterne, conforming therewith in euery line, shape, or shadow. We vse to say that one man is like an other, if but the faces, yea the colours or figures, yea the frownes or smyles, yea the casting of the eyes, or any other shewes in their visages doe seeme to agree, though in other respects or parts there be betwixt them rather apparant repugnances, than any right resemblances; Then let no man think that I will so be put to my shifts, or that I will impose my selfe so hard a taske, as (by descending to each singuler or indiuiduall) to find for it an euen yoak-fellow, or well matching companion, that may



serue as a relatiue or representatiue vnto it, by the aptnesse of propriety: The which labour as it would be endlesse in toile, so would it be no lesse needlesse in vse; and I hope it will suffice, so to compare or make parity betweene the bodies Naturall and Politique, that each part may be brought in rather easilie entreated, than streiningly intruded; and rather agreeing naturally, than forced violently. Therefore omitting all industrious curiousity, and friuolous affectation of following too far (where yet I must needs fall short;) I onely desire, that where I shall shew a reciprocall likenesse of habitude, affection, or disposition; there the similitude may passe approued, and induce assent: and that where these may not readily be had, there I may find such curteous construction, as that I may neither be charged with partiality of concealing (where it is meet I should be mute) nor be suspected of vnsufficiencie for not pursuing where I can find no footing.
            It is vnfallable what I propound for my first principle, That in euery particular person, there is both the seed and similitude of a State incorporat, yet to imagine or seeke for in each seuered or subdeuided parts, such affinitie and fitnesse betwixt them, as may mutually illustrate each other; were not to tune but to crack the strings, and to make quidlibet ex quodlibet, or, ex quouis ligno Mercurium. Modestie and discretion bindeth vs to a stint, beyond the which if we shall stretch or streine,Of enforcing a similitude beyond his agreeablenesse. we may iustly be said to haue borrowed of the wyer-drawers: we must not compell our applications there to shake hands and embrace, where discrepance of nature hath estranged and set apart. Were it not ridiculous for absurditie, and blasphemous for impietie, if in that serious similitude of Christs comming to Iudgement like a theefe in the night, we should



(beyond the ge
                  ••
               inall agreeablenesse of their vnlooked for stealing vpon vs) in other most vngodly sences linke in Christ in likenesse with a theefe? Or if that other notable parable of the vniust Steward, were (from the commendation of his prouident preuention) racked with other references, to make his deceiptfulnesse also praise-worthy; who would not conuince such vnfit and lefthanded handling, both of wildnesse in wit, and wickednesse of hart? To conclude, I will knit vp this point thus, That in the knitting and according of things diuers into one point of agreement, (making by such their enterchangeable lendings of like reason and respect, a lightsomnesse of proofe and vnderstanding) we must auoid their diuersities as sands and rocks, and keep the right channell of an allowed likenesse; which will conduct vs both safely and delightsomly in this course of comparing.
            Farewell.

            A comparatiue Discourse of the Bodies Naturall and Politique.
            
               IT was pithily spoken of Pithagoras,
               
                  Homo monsura rerum omnium.
                That man is the measure of al things: importing thereby, that man by the ampliation and application of his powers apprehensiue, discerneth, discusseth, and confineth the seuerall works of nature: with his sences hee measureth things sensible, with his vnderstanding he perceiueth things intellectuall, with his illuminate &amp; inspired knowledge, he comprehendeth things diuine and supernaturall; yea more, by this so large and vnmeasured measure, all things are made sutable to the esteeme of man, and be either great or small, light or heauy, faire or illfauored, desireable or auoydable, as by mans well or ill conceauing the same bee valued. But beyond all this, the meaning of that sage sentence extendeth yet farther, That in the very composure of man, there is manifestly discouered a summary abstract of absolute perfection, by the which as by an excellent Idea, or an exact rule, we may examine and exemplifie all other things.
            
               The Mathematicians haue found out by their obseruance of the beautious and vniforme proportion of the body of man, and by the symetrie of the parts therof, their true scantlines and dimensions; yea by the laying of it in his full length, &amp; then spreading the armes and legges to their widest compasse, they haue contriued both the perfect square, and the exact circle: The square, by foure right lines at the foure vttermost points of the hands and feet; the circle, by rounding a line about those points, placing the center of their compasse vpon the nauell. The naturall Philosophers reduceth the vastnesse of the vniuersal (comprehending all things that hath either being, or vegitation, or sence, or reason) vnto this same well compacted Epitome of mans fabrifacture.
            Then much more may the politique Philosopher, hauing for his proper subiect the compound of men ciuilly assembled and associate, make man the obiect of his discourse and contemplation, to fit his treatise with good fashion to so imitable a patterne. Therefore this measure (thus induced thereto) I haue made my choice of, to trie thereby the forme of a commonweale, what therein is right or wrye, what redundant or defectiue, what orderly or disproportionable; the helpe of such a briefe, and the trueth of such a standerd, may serue to ballance the matters of deliberation, fitly accommodating and rectifying all designements and proceedings. And sith I doe find this lyne of likenesse to bee chalked out vnto vs in Gods works, I will there begin my applying, where that profound wisdom hath begun his framing.
            As in the creating of man God conioined a soule for



action, in a body passiue: so in his ordinance of mans sociable conuersing (to make the vnion of a body politike) he hath knit together a passiue subiection to an actiue superoiritie:Soueraigntie the soule, Alleagiance the body. and as in euery man there is both a quickning &amp; ruling soule, and a liuing and ruled bodie; so in euery ciuill state,In euery ciuill state there must be the ruling, and the ruled. there is a directing &amp; commaunding power, &amp; an obeying and subiected alleageance, For as neither the soule alone, nor body alone (if they should be seuered) can be a man, so not the ruler alone, nor the subiects alone, can be a commonweale. Where all will rule, there is no rule, and where none doeth rule, there is all misrule: but to rule well, and to bee well ruled, is the surest bond of humane societie.Impugners of magistracie. Such vnruly routs, as (humourously led in dislikes) denyeth the lawfulnesse of Magistrats, may well bee likened to certayne peeuish Male-contents, who ouertoyled with the tediousnesse of life (and that often without any apparant cause) wisheth that they had no soules, it being all one to want in the body a soule, and in the state a gouernour: yet as the body sustayneth no harme or wrong,Magistracie worketh the good of the people. yea is infinitly benefited and graced by the powerfull working of the soule in his organs; so the people guided by a iust gouernmēt, not only are not therby iniured, hindered or abased, but much enabled, enobled, and aduanced euen to the highest pitch of a welthie and safe repose.Mutual offices between soueraigne and subiect. Then as the soule is the forme which to the body giueth being, and essence; and the body is the matter which desiringly affecteth his forme: so both the ruler should wholy indeuour the welfare of his people, and the subiect ought (as in loue to his owne soule) to conforme vnto his soueraigne; that both of them mutually like twinnes of one wombe, may in



the neere and deare nature of relatiues, maintaine vnuiolate that compound of concordance, in which and for which they were first combined. As the coupling of the soule and bodie, tendeth not onely to giue life, but also to the attayning of a perfect and happy life: So the right temper of soueraigntie and obedience, intendeth end effecteth not only the being,The end of gouernment, to make the state happie. but also the florishing and felicitie of a Commonweale. For the gayning of which propounded happinesse, as the soule is the worthier agent, taking the greatest care, and deseruing the chiefest commendation, in so much as a man is not said to be happie for any his strength, his bignes, propernesse, or comely feature of body, but for the goodnesse, noblenesse, and vertuous endowements of his soule: So for the acquiring or framing of any perfection in the Commonweale, we are not so much to behold the largenesse, the power, or the well shewing composure thereof, as the prudencie, justice, and other vertuous sinceritie of a rightful gouernment. In man the soule ruleth by reason, and in the State the Soueraigne gouerneth by lawes;All gouernment by law. which may no lesse aptly be termed the soule of soueraignty, than reason is said to be the soule of the soule. It can neuer bee so much as conceaued, that the soule should be without reason, though by the vnaptnes or repugnancie of the organs, his power in working is either interrupted or impugned: So gouernment may not bee so much as imagined to be without law, though the force and life of the law, through the waywardnesse of the subiects, cannot alwayes alike be shewed or seene in his due effects: no not the Soueraigne will infringe lawes, no more than the soule will renounce reason. Herewith the fiction



of the Poets and the Paynters well agreeth, which in the description and portraiture of Iupiter adioined Iustice sitting on his right hand; howsoeuer it pleased Anaxarchus gybingly to tell Alexander, that Iupiter was not bound thereby to doe iustly, but that the people were thereof to conceiue, that whatsoeuer Iupiter did was iust.
            It is worthie the noting,The Soueraigns loue to their subiects. that albeit the bodie doeth often vnthankefully rebell against the soule, yet the soule euer loueth the body, still seeking to reduce it to the better, euen as a workeman mendeth his tooles, or a Musician his Instruments: whereof good Rulers doe make to themselues this rule, That notwithstanding the subiects by their misbehauiour do often cause an incitation to wrath in their Soueraign against them, yet in the punishing of such offenders, he will discouer no hatred to their persons, but to their faults, shewing himselfe grieued and vnwilling to afflict them, seeking rather their chasticement with pitie, than their destruction with crueltie, and rather to hold a coniunction with them by the mutualitie of louing offices, than to weaken his owne strength by the losse and cutting off the imployable parts of the state publike.The soueraigns care of their subiects welfare. The welfare and prosperitie of the bodie giueth to the soule sweet contentment, as secured thereby from the cares, perplexities, and griefes which want occasioneth: so the plentifull and abundant estate of the subiects, is by a good Soueraigne both maintayned and reioyced at, sith it giueth to him assurance of supply and comfort in all necessities.
            In the creating of man,The excellencie of soueraigntie. God is said to haue breathed into him the soule, whereby the puritie and dignitie



thereof is much extolled aboue that lump of mowlded earth his body: So is the place of preheminence of an high maiestie, &amp; of a more choice and better esteemed worth, as being more to the image of God, &amp; participating more aptly with his greatnes, his power, his iustice, his mercie, his wisdome, his goodnes and bountie, and whatsoeuer els vnspeakable perfection in his vnsearchable essence; for if mans gouerning of the creatures be to the image of God, then the gouerning of men is much more to that image.
            It was not in the power of the body either to chuse or refuse the soule, but his right of admission depended only on the pleasure of his imediate maker.Soueraignes ordained by God. I forbeare to force the consequence so farre, as wholy to debarre the peoples liking or electing of their gouernors: yet somewhat to temper the harshnesse, and to restrain the rashnesse of some peremptorie pragmatikes, I may be bold from that auerment of the soules imbreathing, to propound this application comparatiuely from thence inferred, That in this high poynt of principalitie, God hath reserued to himselfe this prerogatiue ofbestowing that dignitie, according to his owne most vnscrutable counsell: By me (saith he) Kings do raigne. And Saint Paul auoucheth,
                  Rom. 13. That there is no power but of God: Yea Homer produceth graue Nestor, reproouing of Achilles for his obstinate withdrawing from Agamemnons regiment, and his ouerbold contending with the King, sith his Imperie was of God. True it is, that euen in the same phrases all things may be sayd to bee of God, and from God, as the authour, creator, preseruer, and disposer thereof: yet when we find him to single out and appropriat any onething



more especially vnto his owne designements, wee are there to take notice of his greater respectiuenesse, and his ouerswaying greatnesse in the disposing and ordering of that matter beyond the orders and limitations of lawes or customes; yea in such a case he conformeth the secundarie causes, to cooperate with him to his owne ends: as when he framed the peoples hearts, and the concurrance of their consents in the electing of Saul and Dauid vnto the kingly office, whom notwithstanding he had before himselfe appointed and anointed to that function. Wherefore as the soule notwithstanding the mediate meanes of procreation, is vsually sayd to bee infused from aboue into the body: so the Soueraigne euen in his particular parson, but much more the soueraigne authoritie may notwithstanding the approbation of men, or any other assisting helps in the establishing thereof, be rightly auouched to bee ordained and designed by God himselfe.
            As the soule (in imitation of that infinitenesse from which it was first breathed) spendeth all his powers with an insatiate desire in the search and inquisition of more and more knowledge,Against ambition. endeuouring therby a further dilatation or extention of his nature (as to bee like vnto God himselfe:) so doeth oft times a Soueraigne (haughtily conceyted of the likenesse he hath with his ordainer) striue with all restlesse thoughts and deare aduentures, to inlarge the amplitude of his dominion, reckoning it the absolutenesse of perfection to bee extended beyond the compasse of any limitation, and then wishing the subduing of many worlds, that hee might more neerely resemble the highest God, that made and ruleth all the world. But vnto them both



(out of sorrowfull experience) I may adde this correcting caueat, That such ambitious affectation, as it brought vppon the one the depriuation of his former blessednesse, so is it commonly punished in the other by the downefall and dissipation of his so exalted state. And as the one hath euer since beene stinted at a measure of vnderstanding acquirable by the organs of the body (the which to seeke to exceed is a renouncing of humilitie, yea a forgetting of our humane imbecilitie, &amp; a curiositie beyond sobrietie:) so is each soueraigne power listed &amp; confined to his owne territories, maynteinable by the strength therof, the which who so is not cōtented with, is accoūted blamable of a presumptuous &amp; vniust vsurpation beyond the boūds to him assigned.
            In that the soule is authour of action and motion in the body passiue,Soueraignes haue a waightie charge. himselfe being neuer idle, it sheweth by similitude, that the soueraigne doth vncessantly care and labour for the publike good, and that his place is not (as some vayne heads imagine) the seat of idlenesse and pleasure, but that his crowne is accompanied, and euen encompassed with so many restlesse thoughts, and stinging cares, as affoordeth him but small respit of ease, no not in the night season, as Homer describeth his Agamemnon.
            
            Howsoeuer the body be termed passiue, in regard of the soules working in and by his instruments,Soueraignes impart to inferior magistrats a part of their power. yet vnto it also the soule imparteth his power of mouing and acting, and the more noble parts thereof bee the more indued and inabled with the soules best and worthiest faculties.All command in the state deriued from the soueraigne. So is all superioritie and commaund in the state, deriuatiuely branching from the supreme principalitie; and the subiects of best sort, &amp; fittest for vse and



imploiments do share the greatest portion of such their soueraignes subdiuided authoritie: the remembrance &amp; meditation whereof cannot but adde vnto such designed and deriued magistrats a spurre of quickening incouragement, more watchfully to attend so waightie a charge, least through their fayntnesse and dulnesse there be procured to their Soueraigne a distayning disgrace or imputation of disabilitie.Soueraignes wrōged by the negligence of vnder officers. For as when the sences and powers of the bodie bee fallen asleepe, the soule also (as not shewing himselfe in the life of his actions) may be thought to be fast bound &amp; surprised with the same slumbers: so when the substituted and authorized officers do desist from their indeuours and vigilancie in the tendance of the charge or businesse to them credited; the soule of soueraignetie is in such their slacknesse or sleepinesse greatly discredited, as if it were wholy depriued of his power, yea of the very apparance of his gouerning vertue.

                not impossible &amp; vnsensible, that a body should liue or moue by any other soule, than that wherunto by nature it is vnited. And is it not as absurd in any mans vnderstanding, and as preposterous by vsurpation, that any forraine power should intrude to rule and exercise iurisdiction in any other kingdom entire within it selfe,Against forrain supremacy and of absolute supremacie &amp; sufficiencie to gouerneal persons &amp; causes within the dominions therof. Surely, as in euery indiuiduall body, the owne soule thereof sufficeth for all naturall workes requisite to be effected therein: so in euery soueraigne state, the ruling authoritie thereof is of it selfe competent and compleate, for the wel gouerning and ordering of all the affaires, needfull or behouable to be attended vnto, in that entire territorie:



and it may in no wise be contradicted, but that in any countrey, the commaunding, summoning, and censuring of subiects, together with the sentensing of causes, hath his whole dependance &amp; deriuation from the right and preheminence of the soueraignetie and that the duties stile and intitelings vsual and belonging, ought with all submissiue acknowledgement and respectiue reference, to be rendered thereunto: which points of high regalitie, whē any subiect shall either deny vnto his Soueraigne, or take vnto himselfe, what is it els, than as if an inferiour and ministeriall spirit, who hath no other function in the body, but as an agent or deputie for the soule in the workes to him assigned, shall intrudingly vsurpe, arrogate, and possesse the place, name and office of the soule it selfe? except wee should witlessely imagine two soules in one body, like two sunnes in one firmament.
            The soule and the body are so firmely and intirely vnited in nature, that the Philosophers found it no easie worke to bound each from other with iust distinguishment, or proportionable partition. Tullie desirous to hold an equal or middle course, blameth as well Aristippus, for affecting the body too much, as if there were no soule: as also Zeno, for forgetting that we haue also bodies,The rights of soueraigntie not to be to far extended, nor too much restreyned. when he referreth all vnto the soule. Such good respect is obserued to haue beene had in equalling the rights of the Realme and Soueraigne: for such as extendeth preheminence too farre, may bee likened to such Philosophers, as sayd, That man was all soule, and nothing but the soule: And such on the other side which kirbeth too much the awfull authoritie of high supremacie, with an enterpose of



any popular or mediate force to restraine or resist it, agreeth with that Philosophie, That darkeneth, drowneth and imprisoneth the soule within the body, as if it were rather subdued by the bodie, than the bodie endued with his gifts. To be sure to deale indifferently on each part, it is not amisse to consider of them sundred and apart.
            To begin with the soule: If wee should gather and bind together all his distinguished parts,First of soueraigntie. and essentiall faculties, into one as himselfe is one, we shal readily find what in proprietie of interest to him belongeth.The powers of the soule set forth. It fareth with the soule in the body, as it did amongst the Poets with Iupiter in the heauens, who notwithstanding that he did all in all, and was the vnlimitted transcendence aboue al, yet what euer he did in the skyes, in the ayre, and windes, in the earth, in the sea, or places subterraniall, by nature, by force, by arte, by wisdome, by persuasion, by curious workemanship, by profitable inuentions, by extraordinarie instincts of the mind, or by any other meanes whatsoeuer, for gouerning of the world, or the good of man, and the commodity of this life, was attributed vnto some other fayned gods, so as in very trueth, the multitude of gods in those times, was but the multiplicitie of power in one God: The soule likewise in the body being but one, and the same, operating diuersly according to the disposition and aptnes of the instruments, is to challenge to himselfe as the rightfull owner or authour, whatsoeuer life, sence, motion, discerning, health, strength, beautie, abilities, actions, graces, or gifts inherent or appertayning vnto the body, howsoeuer the same (by a change or new purchase of their names) seemeth to disauow



their proceding from his essence. Euen that facultie of vegetation (which seemeth so base and drossie, and to hold most of the earthlinesse of the body) hath yet his originall root and plantation in the soule, whether wee consider the same in the power nutritiue for preseruation, or in the augmentatiue for perfection, or in the generatiue for multiplication, we shall find it wholy to flow from this fountain: with the nutritiue power must concurre appetition, digestion, retention, and expulsion: In digestion is required an immutation, a formation, and an assimilation; in all which so necessarie and fundamentall functions of life, the soule euidently blazeth foorth his effecting force, sith neyther without a soule, nor with any more soules than one, the bodie of it selfe could possibly, either so orderly and concordantly contriue his owne good by so helpfull meanes, or performe such worthy actions by any natiue vigor. The sensitiue facultie is much more sensibly discerned to take discent from the soule. The sences are as the dores and windowes through and forth of the which he maketh his prospects and passages; yea their attendance is so vnseparablie annexed vnto the soule, that where he diuerteth himselfe, and giueth no attention, there the eye seeing seeth not, the eare hearing heareth not, and all other acts of any sences, be voyd of perceiuing or apprehending.
            To discourse at large, with full sailes, how the sences do recommend their conceiuing vnto the fantasie; how the fantasie deliuereth them ouer vnto the vnderstanding; how the vnderstanding either absolutely iudgeth them by reason, or erroniously mistaketh them by opinion; how either reason or opinion, exciteth



affections; how affections either aduised by deliberation, or passionate by humors, induceth the assent of the will; and how the will commaundeth &amp; enforceth motion and prosecution in all or any parts of the bobie: howsoeuer it might amplie and excellently illustrate the powerfull operations of the soule, so orderly lincked, cheyned, and wrapped one within another: yet lest the delightsomnesse of following the tract of so well pleasing a theame, should draw me too far out of my way, I will wynd about againe, by making a second suruey thereof, in the matching to the same of mine applications. The gouerning preeminence of the estate,The matching of the powers of soueraignty to the powers of the soule. though it be somtimes in like maner obscured, and wronged by inferior deriuations; yet such as can surmount the vulgar thoughts, in reducing vnto one glorious and potent head of maiestie, all the seuerall branchings and subalternations thereof, shall easily find how agreeablie it holdeth semblance with the soule, in this respect also, as to be but one, yet effecting all, yea, to be all in all, and all in euery part of the bodie politique. There is not in the Commonwealth, any the least synew for mocion, the least vaine for norishment, the least spirite for life and action, the least strength for defence, or offence, the least member for vse and benefit, which is not replenished with this power, and sucketh from this ouerflowing cesterne, all his subsistance and performance. (And if I thought it not vnfit to be ouer-curious in fitting exactly the particulers of each) I would not pretermit a more large comparing of them, euen in their alike forces of vegetation also. Who seeth not,Soueraigntie in his vegetable power. that it belongeth to the office of Soueraignitie, to prouide for the nourishing



and mainteining of the state with necessaries, to amplifie the dominions thereof, for profit and dignitie, to spread abroad the encrease of the people by Colonies, in the nature of generating or propagating, to cherish in the subiects an appetite of acquiring of commodities, to graunt to them places of Mart and Market for the digesting of the same vnto all parts of the Realme, and so to change forme and assimulate them to their most behoofe: to giue order for the holding and retaining of that which is become their well agreeing and naturall sustenance, and for the expelling as well of the hurtfull ouercharge, as the vnprofitable excrements of the weale publique. Will you yet see farther the soueraigne vertue of the Soueraigne power, in all and euerie the parts of the State? produce me any (though a person altogether priuate, occupying but a roome or drawing breath in the Common wealth) that is not enforced both by foreseeing reason, and after-prouing euents, to acknowledge all his good whatsoeuer, to be first giuen, and then secured vnto him, by the force of a well ordered gouernment, out of the circle whereof there can be neither welfare, nor safetie, but contrariwise, all confusion, slaughter, rapine, and vniust bereauing of him of all that is or can be deare vnto him.
            But who so listeth to behold this Politicall soule of the State in his full royaltie and amplitude, let him looke vpon his more noble parts, the sensuall and intellectuall;In the sensitiue and intellectuall. the according and conforming whereof to his important vses, maketh the Gordian knot of a powerfull and peacefull blessednes. Then the Soueraignitie (mouing, working, &amp; ruling in his three estates) matcheth well the three headed Gerion, whom Iustine


               
interpreteth to signifie the vnion of three louing brethren; then it seeth more than the hundreth eyes of Argus, and acteth more than the hundreth handes of Briareus. All Subiects will, as the sences, play the espials and intelligencers; as the members, be stirred and commaunded in cases of imployment; and as the spirits imaginatiue, propose for apprehension, the true shapes and formes of things, either pleasing and eligible, or hurtfull and auoydable.
            The Councellors of State like the vnderstanding facultie,Councellours. applye all their endeuours to aduance the glorie, and further the enterprises of this their ruling soule, being themselues also by his supreame reason to be ordered, or iudged in their right or wrong conceiuings.
            The fauorites of a Prince may be resembled to the fantasies of the Soule,Fauorites. wherewith he sporteth and delighteth himselfe; which to doe (so the integritie of iudgement, and Maiestie of State be reteyned) is in neither of both reproueable. Which of vs is there that doth not (especially in matters rather pleasing than important) follow and feed his fantasies, giue scope vnto them, suffer them to preuaile with him, reckoning it a great part of his contentment to haue them satisfied? I will refraine to presse the application farther than the well taught Subiects will of themselues conceiue. There must be no despitefull enuying at the Soueraignes fauorites: as they be to him the recreating comforts choicely selected; acceptablie to consort withall; so their enriching, aduauncing, and gracing, with the cleerest signes of their Soueraignes loue, is not onely allowable, but plainely necessarie,



sith they cannot walke continually in the Sunne, but they must needs be coloured.
            The will of the Soueraigne in the decreeing or enacting of Lawes,The Soueraignes will, and whether it alone may stand for law. holdeth the like right as the will of the soule doth in the perfourming the resolues of reason. Allow that the Soule were now in his first cleere sighted innocencie, it could not will or affect any thing that were not absolute reason: So were Soueraignes vncorrupted with that all-taynting canker of sinne, and free from euery humane infirmitie, their will alone were vndoubted law &amp; Iustice; but on the other side, when reason (whose office it is to shew the right) is vanquished by the errours of misconceiuing, then the will by such bad direction is driuen to sinne in his designed works: So where the iudgement of the Soueraigne swarueth from sinceritie of true discerning, there his will and all decrees, or executions following the same, must of necessitie be culpable and turne to wrong. Wherefore sith it will not be gainsaid, but that Soueraignes through their naturall frailties, are subiect as well to the imbecillitie of iudgement, as also to sensuall and irrationall mocions, rising out of the infectious mudd of flesh and bloud, (the obseruance of which tainte in mans nature, caused Plato to say,Plato That the bodie was more in the soule, than the soule in the bodie) and that such their defects may well disable them, from either attayning vnto, or retayning firmely the precise points of perfect Iustice: How both prudently and louingly do those Soueraignes gouerne, who neither taking to themselues that absolutenes of sole power in law-giuing, which by some (being indeed of too hard a temper) is colourably, claymed to



be originall and hereditarie to their places; neither trusting too much to their owne sufficiencies, either of wisedome or vprightnes, (which seldome be without some admixture of imperfections) do at the making of Statutes and ordinances, assemble for consultation and consent, a full assistance of the noblest and choisest aduisours that the State affourdeth: thereby drawing supplies out of their politicall bodie, to make good what wanteth in their naturall?
            From the errors of inferior sences, the conceit of the common sence receiueth much misinforming,Soueraignes often misinformed. which in the end and by degrees reacheth a seducement to the soule it selfe: So may the Soueraigne vnwittingly by wrong reports of some neer about him, be misled from the knowledge of the trueth, into many misbeleeuings. The humors of the bodie do often forciblie preuaile in the working and stirring of the mind;Customes and inclinations of the people oft preuaile with the soueraign. whereupon some Philosophers haue tyed the soule vnto the temperature of the bodie: So the customes and inclinations of the people in each Countrie, hath otherwhile no smal force in the inclyning of the Soueraignes disposition, if not to approue, yet to tollerate some imperfections. The mind must not suffer it selfe, for want of resolution,Resolution in the soueraign. to be distracted by diuersitie of vndiscussed opinions, as wauering and wandering without iudgement, hauing warre within it selfe: So the gouernour may not well admit or harken vnto different and factious sectes, tending to the disturbing and instabilitie of his gouernment. The affections so long as they be obedient vnto reason,Obedience in the people. standeth the soule in great steede; but if they become violent and vnrulie, then (of their disordering, and disturbing of the minds tranquillitie)



they be rightly tearmed perturbations. Such is the Soueraignes case; If the people be tractable, and truely seruiceable, with all dutious subiection, in the nature of right alleagiance, then as louing subiects, by their forwardnesse in cooperating with him, they giue strength and stay vnto his gouernment: but if they turne mutinous and tumultuous, troubling the gouernour and State with seditious disorders, then be they as Rebels by the Iustice of the law to be suppressed, euen as the perturbations of the mind must be subdued by reason, which alone is that powerfull Pallas that bestoweth her golden bridle vpon Bellorophon,
               Rebels. to rule therewith that fierce and haughtie Pegasus. The force of these headie and giddie perturbations is tyrannously extreame, and that not onelie in the common sort of men, (whom like to a heard of Swine, they whirle headlong into a Sea of vices) but also in persons of the best qualitie, whose resistance proueth oft too faint to escape, or keepe off such violent inuasions as suppresseth and vanquisheth euen reason it selfe: So is the Soueraigne sometimes by Traytors and Reuolters surprised and constrained vnnaturally and vnlawfully, to the interruption of his gouernment, and ruinating of the State. Opinion is the forerunner (if not the father) of affections,Opinion. himselfe a verie misbegotten, between Selfe-loue the mother, and Supposall the sire, which (like an amorous make-loue) woeth at once both the virgin Truth, and the harlot Errour, yet affianced to neither, hath but vnperfect notions betwixt both; from which notions notwithstanding, as the same shall apprehend a conceit of good or euill, the affections taking motion, do start forth, putting



themselues in readines, to repell the imagined euill, and to embrace the seeming good. Vpon the surmise of good, Appetites are excited: These be the attendants, and as it were the Courtiers of the soule,Sutors in Court like Appetites. who immoderately seeking to satisfie their own desires, giueth the soule no rest, till he bestow all his faculties of vnderstanding wit, and deuise, to accomplish their requests: Princes seldome want the Apes of such appetites, that is to say, begging and flattering petitioners, pleasing and applauding Parasites, who vsing all cunning insinuating, are neuer without their varietie of sutes, to aduance their owne good, howsoeuer their Soueraigne be thereby either impouerished or dishonored. Vpon the opinion of euill ariseth that hidious &amp; snakie head of Medusa, fearfull, fretfull, greeuing, carefull, repining, and dispairing thoughts, filling the soule with the horror of much discomfiture; such malecontents and froward cinicks the Soueraigne oft is pestered with,Malecontents. who neuer well pleased with the aucthorized proceedings, (though most approueable) doe still feed vpon their owne disliking conceits, and will alwaies with the Keistrell, flie against the winde, making their opposicion (by clamorous complaints) against aucthoritie. These affections of both sorts, being in their originall altogether oppinionat, will sometimes (by reason of the neerenesse that opinion hath vnto reason) make bold to alleage reason for themselues,Pretenses in treason. and will seeme to be iudicious &amp; iust in their intendements. This wanteth not his semblance (as in the natures before described) so chiefely in some Traitors of better place, who knowing their dignities in neernesse to the Prince, and of commaund in their Countries, will take vpon them



(though intending their owne end) to pretend equitie &amp; honestie, yea, and the Soueraignes aucthoritie also, giuing out a populer pretext of publique good, onely to make way thereby to their foule treasons.
            The mind hath yet one endowment more, which almost equalleth all the rest;Records and their imbeziling or falsifying. which is a faithfull memorie of his fore-attainted knowledges, in whose good trust and custodie, he treasureth vp all his rich acquirings: what semblance there is thereof also in the soule of State, it cannot be obscure. The Soueraigne is well stored with remembrancers, nothing passeth from him, or setleth in him but by record; All his seates of Iudgement entereth and preserueth the proceedings in causes; and to forge, corrupt, or embezill the Recordes (whereof any good gouernment hath a tender and strict regard) what is it else, Than as if the memorie should be cleane taken from the mind, to the which it is vnseperable, or should become a lying misreporter; which nor his nature, nor his office can endure.
            These faculties the soule doth shew and exercise, in and with the organs of the body, but he hath a farther and more inlarged force,Prerogatiue royall. beyond &amp; without the compasse of any concreat or materiall substance, as abstracting and segregating himselfe to his owne puritie, and aduaunced thereby to a more neere resemblanee of the diuine nature. For as we rightly conceiue of God, that albeit he worketh efficiently, and (if I may so say) naturally, by the mediate causes, yet his potencie is not so by them tied or confined, but that he often performeth his owne pleasure by extraordinarie meanes, drawne out of his absolute power, both preter &amp; contra naturam: So the soule, besides his vsuall &amp; functionarie operations,



in and by the ministerial abilities of the body, hath other peculiar motions and actions of his owne, neither aided nor impeached by any corporiall assistance or resistance.
            To this likenesse of God and the soule, let vs also shape our Soueraigntie: which (besides that which is regular in regiment, and from his power and goodnes imparted vnto the people) hath still, and reteineth to it selfe certaine prerogatiue rights of most ample extentions, and most free exemptions, whereof true reuerence (filled with all submissiue acknowledgements, and contented with that portion and interest which it receiueth from regalitie) admitteth no questioning disputes, and whereof iust gouernours do not so farre inlarge the lists, as to do what they lust, but do so moderate the vse (as God in the world, and the Soule in the body) not to the impeach, but to the support of iustice; not to the hurt, but to the good of subiects.
            Thus hauing perused the seuerall parts and properties of the soule, together with the likenesse and correspondēce of soueraigntie therto; not without touching also the dangers and declinations whereunto they both are subiect: I should (if I were not tied within a teather, and thereby restrained from al affectionate discoursing or dilating) frame vnto them both some hortatorie admonition vnto circumspect demeanure, for the preuenting of ensnaring euils, and reprochfull obloquies.Soueraignes not to be euill spoken of. O let not the pure substance of the soule, for some few his imperfections be vnpurely censured: so neither the deare reputation of anointed maiestie maliciously traduced by some slender imputations. If vppon some displeasing occasions his anger be enkindled, shall any



               Zeno dare to say of him (as of the soule) That hee is all fire? If he should bee thought somewhat to offend in softlinesse and effeminatnes, will the Philosopher Hippias (as he defined the soule) so slaunder him to be but water? If he could be noted for a little leuitie and vnconstancie, must there needs bee found out straight some Anaximenes, to terme him as he conceiued of the soule, to bee wauering and fleeting ayre? If caringly he regard the support of his high port, by attending his profits, and looking to his prouisions, is hee to be concluded and pronounced, as Zenophantes thought the soule, to be concreat of earth? How much better were it rather to apply vnto the Soueraigne the opinion which Aristotle held of the soule, that he consisteth of the pure and excellentest essence, being to be accounted scant any humane creature,
                  Cicero.
                but wholy of a celestiall temper, as from thence both originally ordained, &amp; daily gouerned? or to make him hold comparison with the soule, in that supremest title (which Euripides durst bestow vppon the soule) euen to be a God. For which appellation to bee bestowed vppon the Soueraigne, the God of gods hath giuen vs a warrant beyond all warrants, The manifold and mightie effects, which in, and for the body politique, this states soule performeth, doth ratifie the same by reason also. Is not the body of it selfe a confused lump, vnformed, sencelesse, witlesse, and destitute of all helping meanes to mayntaine it selfe from perishing and vtter dissoluing? and doth not this soule (setting to worke all his assisting powers) quicken it, moue it, care for it, prouide for it, cherish it with his loue, furnish it with his gifts, gouerne it with his wisdome, establish it with his iustice, &amp; protect



it with his puissance? If then he bee the deriuatiue, and (as it were) a diminitiue of the mightie God, shall not his vassals (both respectiuely to his so high entitelings,The Soueraigne a God. &amp; gratefully for his great deseruings) refraine their rashnesse of deeming and dooming in his doings? and rather reuerently recognize the blessed benefits that bindeth them to loue, than with a Gyant-like presumption seeke to depraue his sacred estimation? to accumilate calumnies and detractions against the Soueraigne (so to abase and pull downe maiestie) is like to the pyling vp of hill vppon hill, to warre with heauen: and it may be better called petit blasphemie, for a subiect to blemish the Soueraigne with soule aspersions, than it is called petit treason for a seruant to slay his master; sith the dutie and priuitie betweene them is more astringent, and the offences against a dietie hath an infinitie of sinne.
            There is a question amongst the Philosophers, where and in what part of the body the soule should bee seated; some place it in the head,The large extent of soueraigntie, by cōparison with God and the soule. as in the highest towre, with his chiefe informers, aduisors and assistants round about him; some in the heart, as the middest of his kingdome, from thence to spread and distribute life and spirit more readily to all the parts; and others alotting to it no chiefe seat at all, extendeth it equally vnto all, though it shew it selfe in each member differently as their capacities or abilities will permit, as if it therein also were in similitude with God himselfe, who being by the infinitie of his essence, euery where, yet is no where circumscribed, bounded with no including limits, or more certainly in one place than in another: but as God is sayd to haue his center euery where, his



circumference no where; to be in all places, yet not placed; and with euery thing, yet mixed with nothing: So the soule communicating to all the parts his essentiall nature, is not encompassed by any part, nor is not more present in any one than in all. And as God (notwithstanding such his vnmeasureable infinitenes of being euery where) is often said possitiuely, &amp; namely there to be, wher he maketh the more apparance of his presence: So the soule may be said there to be resiant, where his force and efficiencies be most discerned; when he attendeth the discussing of Intelligence and reason, then is his chaire of estate placed in the vpper house, and so seemeth to dwell in the head. When he betaketh himselfe to matter of Action, or followeth the feruencie of affections, then he is thought to be conteined within the irascible part enwalled in the breast, and issuing chiefely from the hart; when he falleth lower to the place of bestiall concupiscence, then he there also discouereth his presence in those inferior parts. And (in a word) according to the aptnesse or appliablenesse of any part, wheresoeuer he acteth, there he is: because (as Aristotle teacheth) the efficient must conioyne vnto the effect, &amp; the mouer to the moued.
            If any desire to vnderstand how this discourse of the Soules either larger dilatation of himselfe throughout the whole bodie, or of his more especiall appropriating of his presence and worke vnto particuler parts, will accord by comparison with Soueraigntie in a State ciuill; let him in like sort examine how fitly the name of the head agreeth with the nature of a Soueraigne; and how properly the heart patterneth the preeminence, and how he doth seuerally conuey and impart to any



part of his dominions, the verie essentiall faculties of his gouernment; without the which no people can euer as subiects raunge themselues into the order, and communitie of humane societie, howsoeuer, as men, or rather as wild sauages, they may perhaps breath a while vpon the earth. It is a truth, that as the Soule, so the power of principalitie in gouernment, (though shewing it selfe in diuerse manner, as the varietie of euents ministreth occasion) yet in all points, and all parts is all one. And that a righteous Soueraigne (as the soule doth in defending and succouring any the least member from destruction and harme) hath an vnpartiall and most respectiue care, which extendeth it selfe (as God and the Soule doth) vniuersally to the whole, and particulerly to each member indiuiduall. The which point of so large dilating his force, (to the resemblance of such two patterns in a manner secresed and vnseene) if I might haue leaue to straine a little farther, I could haue it serue me also thus far, as (at the least) to make a shew in that question propounded by some great Clerks in policie, touching the Princes ouer prodigall imparting of his presence amongst his people: For seeing that both God and the Soule,Of the Soueraignes shewing himself to the people. working so vnlimitably, be yet vndiscerned, in their essence, as hidden and concealed from the eyes of men; it may seeme to stand more with maiestie,

                and to work more regarding, more admiring, and more adoring, if (howsoeuer their power in operating doth shew it selfe) yet their presence be more sparingly &amp; lesse familiarly vouchsafed. What is become ordinarie, that we vse either neglectingly to contemne, or fastidiously to dislike; as on the other side, what hath for strangenesse



a noueltie, for worth a dignitie, and for attayning a difficultie, is more desiringly, and more admiringly esteemed. Hence ariseth in the minds of subiects such egernesse and longing to satisfie their sences in the seeing, hearing, and well knowing of their Soueraigne, as if they were to seeke after the head of Nilus, which sendeth them the ouerflow of their plentie; or after the primum mobile of the world, which gouerneth the conuersions and fortunes of their life. It is herof concluded, that a Soueraigne the lesse he is exposed to publique obseruance, the more he is presupposed to excell in amplitude of glorie: neuerthelesse it being so commendable a vertue in a gouernour to haue such a facilitie and goodnesse of nature, as (remitting the high cariage of his greatnesse) yeeldeth to his people with an affable gentlenesse easie approach for enterlocution. I cannot tell whether the contrarie sternenesse (in haughtily shunning or repulsing their aspect) will not haue (in the euen eye of a well regarding policie) the greater disallowing. Now let vs passe on to peruse the comparisons, taken from the head.
            
               Plato imagined man to be an heauenlie plant;
                  Plato.
                his head to be the roote;Mans head his root. his bulke, the stocke; his armes and leggs the branches; and his root to draw his sapp from the heauens to feede therewith the vnder parts, spreading downeward towardes the earth. Such a plantation do I conceiue in the institution of a State politique: the soueraign head to be designed, inspired, depending, and protected from aboue; and the body with the out-growing parts thereof, to receiue nourishment, strength, florishing, and fruitfulnes from that root of a rightfull regiment. If the root thriue, sucking



abundantly of his heauenlie nutriment, the plant must needes prosper, and cannot do amisse: but if the root be destitute of grace, as depriued of his sapp, it induceth vpon the whole stocke of the State, a withering decay and pining barrennesse.The excellencie of the head or Soueraigne. In the head is the first wheele &amp; string of motion, giuing force and order to the whole frame, the first fountaine of sence streaming from thence to the other cesterns, and the high erected pallace, where the mind keepeth his court, shining in his greatest Maiestie. The head is by the order and instinct of nature,The head loued of the bodie. so dearely esteemed and honored of the bodie, as that euery part will not onely seek his ease and health, but euen expose it selfe to any perils for his sake and safetie: the inferior parts do susteine and beare him vp, mouing at his beck, and fast bound when he taketh rest: the hands and armes, do readily receiue vpon themselues the strokes and wounds, intended against the head; yea, any part doth endure paine, by incision, scarifying, ligature, or issue, to remedie the greeuances of the head. These good duties of kindly subiection, to kingly power, I leaue to the consideration and conscience of euery true subiect, wishing him to make his best vse thereof by contemplating and applying of the same in the performance of like offices of alleagiance, loue, and loyaltie. We see the head naturally endued with a fellow feeling of any the griefes in the whole bodie, in so much as there is scant any disease so weake or small in any part, as doth not affect and disturbe the head also; yea, it holdeth such a sympathie with the verie foot, as that a little wet or cold taken in that remotest place,Soueraignes haue a sympathie with subiects. hath forthwith a readie passage to the head. Gracious Soueraignes



haue the like compassions and compunctions in the distresses of their subiects, and be in the same sort deeply peirced &amp; perplexed with any wrong or distemperatures, hapning to the meanest of their people.How to think of soueraignes faults. I haue learned of the Phisitions, that most of the diseases of the head, are originally arising and caused from the bodie: and I think that I may thus thereof infer; That many the escapes of Soueraignes by omission or comission, may thus far by this excuse be extenuated, as more imputable to the people than to them.Subiects haue a cause to beare with Soueraignes faults. Therefore when from the head a fluxe of humours shall annoy and enfeeble the whole, or any part, I wish it should be remembred, that such as is our offering, such should be our suffering. Many and verie dangerous be the euils, that from a distempered heat be distilled into the bodie. I might laboriously enlarge what harmes he may do to his subiected members, by his seuerall excesses or defects, the disorder and vneuen cariage wherof filleth the whole with remedilesse mischiefes. Yet let vs marke this withall, That in the naturall bodie, there was neuer any parts so far digressing from their natiue nature of alleageance, and their indissolluble band of obedience, forgetting as well the good which they otherwise receiue,No opposition to the Soueraigne, much lesse no deposing of them. as the wrong whereby they continually infest him, as did once presume to oppose, or but repine against their head, much lesse seeke or attempt to shake him off the shoulders. How much more kind be those subiects, who out of their owne dutious loue,Kind subiects take vpon themselues the blame imputed to the Soueraigne. be content to haue the blame of the faults, or ouersights, likely to blemmish their Soueraigne, transferred &amp; imposed vpon themselues? It may seeme by a drunkard in Plautus, that the head



thought himselfe priuiledged, as it were with a point of prerogatiue, to charge the inferior parts with the shame of his owne distemper; Siccine fit hoc pedes? statin an non? Nam hercle si cecidero vestrum erit flagitium.
               
                  In Pseud.
               
            
            Here leauing the head in his vnresistable right of ruling ouer the bodie, I will to the Soule againe, taking a farther view thereof,The soueraign likened to the heart. as sitting in his other principall seat the hart: when I behold the intricate net or curious web of vaines, spread from it ouer all the bodie; me thinketh I may well liken it to a little spyder, placed in the middest of her work, where she so caringly and cunningly ordereth the matter, that she presently feeleth the least shake or touch in any though the farthest part of her webb. No lesse feelingly doth the hart perceiue, and partake, with any iniurie done vnto his veines. Sometimes hee sendeth forth the bloud and spirits with a full flush, replenishing all parts plentiously, other while he rerireth them home with all speed to his little sconce, to comfort and fortifie it selfe.The cōmaund and force of soueraigntie.
            
            It is admirable to see the swift and sudden recourse of bloud, now stirred outwardly at a start like lightning, and anon posting backe in feare of daunger to the hearts succour, leauing a palenesse and trembling in the outward parts. The heart is the well of life, the furnace of heat, the center of bloud, the first liuing and the last dying part. Agreeably to these vertues or efficacies of the heart, let it be confessed, that euerie commonweale acknowiedgeth a soueraigne power, from the which it drew his first beginning, of which it receiueth his dearest life bloud, with which it is quickened as with a liuing fire, to the which it wholy trusteth, and returneth for refuge, by which it is imployed and



directed in all intentions, and without which it fayleth of continuance, and is incontinently dissolued. Then to such a Gouernour which both imparteth to al parts the vaines and artiries of their surest welfare, and hath a sence of any their griefs and wrongs, as of his owne; what and how regardant thankfulnesse, seruice, and obseruance is deseruedly due by the faythfull performance (with the vttermost strayne of the very heartstrings) of all obedience to his commaunds and authoritie.
            The heart is of all other the firmest flesh, yet not fed with bloud by any vaynes; and from it all other flesh deriueth by veynes his borrowed liuing. I haue heard it argued,Of the Soueraigne all hold what they haue. that a King in like sort is alone firmely and absolute stated, in and to the lands of his realme, and that all other owners take from him by the veynes and conueyances which he passeth to them. That which Aristotle saith of the heart, That it giueth and imparteth to euerie member, but it selfe receiueth or taketh not from any; is a good pattern of regall magnificence and bountie,Bountie in a Soueraigne. seeing that nothing more aptly representeth the nature of the soule, or commeth neerer to God himselfe than to do good, and extend reliefs to others, with free heart and open hand, himselfe in the meane while hauing no need of any. The figure of the hart is shaped sharpe poynted at the lower end,Soueraignes loue of vertue. and vpward it is more widely spread abroad: To this forme the best princes doe conforme, they open their hearts with a full spread towards vertue, goodnesse, and heauenly things, but do make narrow and close the same against all base appetites of this vnhallowed flesh. The heart is the dwelling place of the affections and inclinations



of the mind, whereof (as of his owne trayne, family, or houshold,Soueraigns to looke well to them that be neer about thē
                he alone is to haue the gouernment) if they bee let loose with scope to follow their disordered desires, not only the heart it selfe is subdued and trampled vpon by their turbulent passions, but the whole bodie also fareth the worse, and taketh no small harme thereby. Right wisely doe Soueraignes hereof take this instruction, to vphold their gouernment in a strict steadinesse, tempering all extremities with an euennesse of moderation, that none about them grow too violent or headstrong, which cannot but worke as a disturbance to their persons, so a disproportion to their states.
            Where any affection predominantly reigneth, it draweth thither such humors of the bodie, as are likest and best consorteth to it selfe:How factions grow▪
                as anger calleth to him choller, to further his fiercenesse; mirth cheareth it selfe with the freshest bloud; and sorrow will not bee without the company of sower and dumpish melancholike: So if the Soueraigne in the precincts of his regiment, shall suffer an ouergrowing inequalltie of greatnesse to get an head, it will quickly gather to it selfe a syding faction of like disposed disturbers, which will make a shrewd aduenture, both of ouertopping him, and ouerturning of his state.
            There is nothing that is either more gracefull for seemelinesse of shew,The Soueraignes sports not to be grudged at. or more auaileable to any man for his health, than to haue alwayes a light and chearfull heart: and it was yet neuer seene that any part of the body euer grudged at or repugned, but rather willingly furthered the well-pleasing delights of the heart. From hence good people will learne this well-resembling



inference, That the recreating sports and pleasures of Soueraignes (in whom is the heart bloud of the ciuill bodie) be not dislikingly crossed or repyned at, but rather entertainingly allowed, and comfortably affoorded vnto them; yea though some occasions of dislike should worke a distaste, and harder censure thereof.
            We doe account as the head, so the heart to receiue hurt two waies,Two wayes to wrong the Soueraigne. primarily, or imediatly; and by consent which it hath with other more choicely affected and much agrieued parts: so may wee reckon offences or misdemeanors to tend to the impugning of the prince, not onely when they directly concerne his owne person, state, or dignitie, but also when they bee committed against his Councell, Iudges, or chiefe officers, in whom their Soueraigne hath ingrauen his own image or character, imparting vnto them a portion of his owne authoritie, and with whom hee maintayneth a mutualitie of all ayding kindnesse, and honourable respectiuenesse.
            Admit that the heart or the brayne were so layd open to ouraspects,Maiestie in a Soueraigne. that wee might attentiuely behold the substance, the shape, the verie life and actions therof; would not the consideration of the dignitie of the soule, there resiant and working, worke an impression in our thoughts, to regard, esteeme, and admire those parts, as excelling and surpassing all the rest? so when the person of a Prince is looked vpon (wheron we doe seldome gaze enough) our inward cogitations filled with a reuerence of the regall maiestie seated in that flesh (otherwise as infirme and full of imperfe
                  •••
               ons as otherA Soueraigne how to bee respected. is) ought to surmount all sensuall conceits (scant



thinking of any humane nature) but making an infinit difference betweene that body, so (as it were) glorified with the presence, representation &amp; in dwelling of that supreme or exalted eminencie, and other ordinarie persons, which yet doeth consist materially of the same substance, and perhaps endued by nature with equall graces.
            Doe you desire a brighter displaying of the illustrious maiestie shining in soueraigntie?Diuersities of respects in the Soueraign touching his person and his soueraigntie. doe but obserue how much it surmounteth the person it selfe thereof possessed, like a brittle glasse all illightened with the glorious blaze of the Sunne. The Soueraigne as in his personall respects, hath his childhood and his impotencie of minoritie, but his Soueraigntie is like Hercules the sonne of Iupiter, that in his verie cradle could gripe Snakes to death, being at no time abridged or enfeebled, but to be supposed euer of a full strength, age, and power. In his personall respects he may partake of the mixture of bloud and kindred with the subiects, but soueraigntie admitteth no termes or titles of consanguinitie. In his personall respects hee is as one man, single and indiuiduall, yet as in the right of Soueraigntie, he gayneth the appellation and capacities of a corporation: In his personall respects death maketh an end of his life and glorie all at once, but soueraigntie neuer faileth (not by the space of one moment still liuing in a successiue continuatiō:) and as the consideration of the excellēcie of the soule (wherunto the soueraigntie, as in these respects also is agreeably patterned) caused the old Philosophers (not able by their sharpe inquirings to penetrat into the deep profoūdnes therof) admiringly to proclayme,Man the great miracle of nature. That man was magnū naturae



miraculum. So the resplendence and power of soueraigntie in the royall person of a Soueraigne, shewing it selfe both in so great maiestie, as dazleth the eyes of all beholders, and in so admirable effects, as to transforme sauagenesse into ciuilitie, repugnances into concords, vices into vertues, procuring loue, yet implying feare; compelling obedience, yet with yeeld of highest honour; holding towards all, the proportion of iustice, yet extending withall the remorse of mercie, doeth in like sort (by such the conuersion of the body naturall, into a body politicall) beget thereunto a more admired glory, and a more deere esteeme.
            Let me yet proceed a little farther in the discerning of the wisdome and goodnesse of the Creator, in the ordeining and enduing with propertie of these principall receptacles of the soule, the head, and the heart:Nor head nor heart haue any power to doe wrong. we doe not find that either of them is naturally enabled to offer any wrong by any meanes vnto the body, or once to encline by any so much as imagination of mischiefe therunto; but contrariwise, fully furnished and accomplished with store of helping reliefs, to nourish and preserue the same. For as in God himselfe (if it were possible that he should doe any vniustice) it would make a greater proofe of his impotencie, than shew foorth his power: So if he had giuen vnto the soule, or to these parts most replenished with the powers thereof, any such naturall abilitie or qualitie, as might inferre an iniury and preiudice to the rest of the bodie; it might rightlyer bee termed a disabling than an enabling, and no way conforming to his image: for what a confusion or rather destruction would ensue, if the head should shrinke vp his sinewes that conueieth his vigor and spirits



vnto the members? or if the heart should at his pleasure withhold or take away the nourishment of bloud, that giueth sustenance &amp; substāce to the whole body? If the application hereof to our states soule: How comfortably may we conceiue, &amp; euen glory in our happinesse, that stand vndubitably assured of our Soueraigns goodnesse (which limitteth or rather much exceedeth his power) that the sinewes of law &amp; iustice knitting all subiection to soueraignetie, shall still from him receiue an increase of strength and firmenesse: and that this politicall soule (in the very tendernesse of his soule) will be so farre from depriuing and impayring of our necessarie nutriments, as that he will rather draine his owne heart bloud drie, than the wealth of the land should either be wastfully exhausted, or not suffisingly maintained?
            The Soule also hath made choice of some other principall parts in the body,Certaine essentiall orders in the state. which he needfully vseth &amp; imployeth in the ministeriall functions of life; which if they once eyther fayle in their offices, or decay in their essence, the body can neither continue liuing, nor performe his actions: of which sort may bee reckoned, first the lungs and lights, ordeined for the alaying of the heat in the heart, and the necessitie of respiration: Then the liuer, which beginneth the concoction of our susteinance, and the same so prepared, doth recommend ouer to the hearts more perfect conuerting and accommodating: Lastly, the milt, the gall, and the kidnies, euerie whereof is alotted to some good worke of disseuering the refuse and drossie remnants from the selected and purified nutriment. But for that in these the soule sheweth his weakest and meanest vertue,



which is of vegitation onely, whereas in the head, or heart, he displaieth all his glorie, conuersing with them as with the darlings of his loue, I esteem it of no great merit,The gifts of statesmen to be wel disposed of. to meditate too much of their worth, or to labour the likening of them (which to do were easie and obuious) vnto certaine necessarie and essentiall orders or powers in the state. Only two considerations I haue conceiued, which mee thinketh may not bee omitted. The first, That as these bee placed so helpfully in the body, with such succeeding each other in their works, as accordeth to an accomplishment of health and perfection in the whole: so there must bee in the publike weale, a wise and politicall ordering of the good gifts and imployments of the chiefe statesmen, that their endeuours be discreetly sorted to the generall good, and not suffered out of course either promiscuously to intrude,Chiefe officers or nobles to be well safgarded. or disorderedly to cause dissentions. The second, that as these parts of chiefe vse for the preseruation of life, be by the prouidence of nature strongly sauegarded within an enclosed wall, as more cared for than the rest; so such as be the more noble and more necessarie members of the commonweale, ought to bee attended on with the more tender regard of their safetie, and well prouided for against perilles, least in their ruyne or subuersion, the whole State also receiue a deadly stroke.
            The mentioning of these partes of the bodie (though vpon occasion of setting forth the operations of the Soule, in and by them) hath put me in mind of my fore-intended Method; which after a matching of the ruling preeminence to the nature of the soule, calleth me to a suruey or recounting of such obserueable



respects, as may make the like correspondence betweene the subiects of a state, and the condition of a bodie: Wherein I must be faine to deale with the bodie of the state, as Minerua did with the bodie of Vlisses, who in the safe conducting, and reducing of him to his true Penelope, did transforme him into diuers shapes, sometimes putting vpon him the shew of a rimpled and withered age, and anone againe restoring him to his freshest hew, and lustiest strength: So will I also (holding my intention to make at last an euerlasting vnion of the obeying bodie to the soueraigne aucthoritie) turne the same, as I treat thereof, into different formes, diuersities, and altering respects, according as any varietie of consideration shall afford. And I must also further entreat the good patience &amp; licence of my frendly Readers, for affording vnto me such libertie, as my selfe scantly liketh of; which is of inserting and giuing a place in the contexrure of this Treatise, vnto some such comparisons, as by there frequent vse in good Authours may seeme to be ouer vulgar, which I could haue been well content to haue auoyded, had they not pressed vpon me with some shew of necessitie, sith the more notoriously their likenesse hath bin discouered &amp; allowed, the more might I be noted either of ignorance in not discerning so publike proofs for my purpose, or of an affected singularitie, in contemningly omitting what the worthiest writers haue chosen as diamonds and precious stones to enrich and garnish their works withall. And thus much perhaps I may performe in part of amends, that by such (as it were) my new setting thereof, the same shall be more lightsomly refreshed, and emblazoned with a more



orient lustre.
            In the composition of the bodie politique (as of the naturall) there is required a concurrance or euen mixture of foure Elements,The fower Elements of the bodie politique. which I do reckon to be these following: First, the generous, to aduance and mainteine the state with their well deseruing actions: Then the learned, to instruct and direct with skill in cases of consultation: Thirdly, yeomen with their labour to produce and worke the commodities of the land: And lastly Trafiquers which may both vent out by exportation what may be spared, &amp; bring in the necessaries that shall be wanting. Within these foure sorts, all Subiects compacted into a Ciuill state, may well be raunged and reckoned. How these state-Elements may seuerally hold similitude, with either the Fire, or the Aire, or the Earth, or the Water, I leaue to be conceiued and disscussed of such as haue good leasure to be idle, or like well to be somewhat curious. This I think not impertinēt to propound, That where any of these do exceed,The well mixing of the elements. or ouer sway the rest, there such distemper (as in the bodilie mixture) inclineth the State to be ruled by that ouer-ruling force. And as in our bodies by the vnequall temper of the Elements the humors get masterie each ouer other (of which humors the diuersities of complexions do arise:) So in the bodie politique, according as either the baser and passiue Elements do preuaile to popularitie, or as the other more worthie and actiue, do reduce to the power of a few; thereof the humor, complexion,The predominance of the elements actiue or passiue, maketh the complexion of the bodie politique. condition, and disposition of the state is discouered: in so much as (if the Soule or superioritie of gouerning be not strong enough to hold his owne) the exsuperance



of the humour predominant, hauing altered the complexion of the bodie, will also violently draw the soule to follow the forme of his temperature: wherefore right needfull it is in any Commonweale, to contriue the true and proportionable mixture of these foure Elements, lest when they be put at odds, reuerting to the originall repugnances of their nature, they do fill the state with hatefull strifes, in the steed of blessefull peace. For as in the bodie naturall,The elements to be held in concord. if the wisdome of the Creator had not composed into a concord the contrarieties of the first Elements, it had (as still sticking in the confusion of the first Chaos) neuer attained the strength, beautie, &amp; order, which we now admire: So in the ciuill bodie, if prudent policie by aduised tempering of the disparitie of the people, should not conioyne them to a well agreeing consent, how could any hope be conceiued, but that the difference of poore and rich, vulgar &amp; noble, ignorant and learned, fearfull and valiant,Discords in the parts of one and the same elemēts. industrious and such as take their ease, must needs by their opposite quallities, not onely deface the dignitie, but also subuert the stabilitie of the state? yea the differences of such as be all of one Element, through a naturall emulation, (each part seeking to attaine neerest to the center and perfection of that whereunto he is incircled) proueth oft spitefully troublesome, and must come vnder the care of a well disposing prudencie. For as the more trafiquing maketh the greater merchants, the happier husbanding the richer yeomen; so the more vertuous may stand vpon it to be reckoned, the more generous. And each exsuperance will disturbe the temper, if for the gouerning of such inequalities, and preuention of strife



amongst themselues, the wisdome of the State (taught by natures example) did not vse a correspondent cariage. From the discrepance of vnequall temperature, ariseth so sundrie formes and shapes of bodies politique.Sundry formes of bodies politique. Some are hugely big, and their verie greatnes rendreth them vnwildie, hauing their armes and their legs too far a sunder; some verie little, yet well compact, actiue and strongly set to saue themselues; some carie a goodly shew on their outside, yet inwardly looked into, haue great defects, as either a foule Soule in so faire a bodie, or some deadly wringes tormenting their verie bowels; Some not so well fauoured or pleasingly shaped, yet are sound enough, and in good health; Some be so fat and ouer fed with wealth, as their neighbours be therby tempted to make attempts against them: some so lean and forlorne, as that their pouertie is their best safetie: some all sluggish and sottish, can scant attend their owne defence, but do so long praie aide of others, till they be made a prey to all; some haughtie and fierce are neuer out of quarrels making, and taking occasions, through the flames of ambition, and the gall of reuengefulnesse, to exercise a continuall enmitie. Thus we see how (after the example of the bodie naturall) the State ciuill also, is diuersly figured, and varieth his formes, whereof (were I not bound to breuitie) I could of each sort make instance and demonstrance in particuler, But it liketh me better, to hold my accustomed course, by speaking in generalitie: for that I may so hope to instruct some, and be sure to offend none.
            Where the humors are in good harmonie of good agreement, &amp; the bodie thereby in good health, there



we doe not dislike to haue flesh and fat enough, but if they be peccant, and so the bodie crasie,In a distemper all turneth to hurt, euen that which otherwise were good enough. then the more liberally we feede, the more dangerouslie wee doe offend. So in a State, when each degree conformeth it selfe to his owne duties, makng in the whole a perfection of loue and obedience, then the abundance of riches, the multitude of people, the titles of honor, the encrease of power, are both auailable &amp; commendable: But when any part becommeth outragious or exorbitant, whereby the body is in a distemper, and getteth an euill habite, then what was otherwise comely and comfortable, will turne cumbersome and dangerous, working a cleane contrarie effect, of a greater endamagement, if not of an vtter diuastation.

               ing, his puissance, his drowping, his decay and downfall. The Philosophers,Philosophers. for the reason of alterations in both the bodies, direct vs to their principals of generation and corruption,The causes o change in the bodie politique. telleth vs of the imbecillitie and mutabilitie of things compounded, of the difficultie of persisting in perfectnes, of the easie declination into the worse, and of their foreframed connexion of effecting causes. The Astronomers haue also alike fitted them both with certaine climatericall changes,Astronomers. appointed periodes, and fatall reuolutions: yea they teach vs, that the influence of superior planets do forcibly preuaile (as in and ouer priuate persons) so also ouer whole regions and kingdomes, changing and inuerting them at their pleasures. I will yeeld vnto the Philosophers their consequences and dependancie of causes,



touching the many variable euents in both bodies, yet with this prouision,God in alterations worketh the causes, and oft without causes. That the first cause, combyning and causing all causes be not forgotten, who alone hath all life and death, beginnings and endings at his dispose. Neither will I sticke with the Astronomers to acknowledge their stinted times, and prefixed points, beyond the which neither of the said bodies can passe or prolong themselues one instant: But to attribute that to the Starres, which the God (which holdeth all the starres in his hands) challengeth to himselfe, and his owne foredecreeing councels, were to refuse the sunne, and be guided by a star-light: He it is that raiseth and strengthneth some mightier (like to superior planets) to subdue the worthlesse, whom he hath refused; and his inclining of harts is the right powerfull influence, that effecteth these great chaunges. Then (leauing this humane wisdome fast tied vp within these limitations, as in the iron net of Vulcan) I will onely make this gaine of that first comparison, That sith the said two bodies are so fitly and fully conioined in semblance by their whole course, euen from the cradle to the graue; I shall not need to feare blame, for fashioning of their agreeablenes in other also more particuler considerations.
            
               Difference of parts in the Commonwealth vegetable.In the Commonwealth (as in the bodie) some parts seeme chiefely vegetable, caring for nothing more than to mainteine their growth, by their sucking from all the vaines of the land, the nutriment and prouisions of this life.Sensitiue. Some liue all sensually, giuing no rest or contentednesse to themselues, but by pleasing of their sences, feeding of their affections, and fulfilling of their desires; be it of reuenge in the course of wrath,



and quarelling, or of haughtines to aspire, or of lust to sensualitie. Othersome moderated with staiednes in both the former, shape their liues after the powers rationall and intellectuall,Rationall. disposing themselues by the rules of reason, to vertuous actions, and to studious cogitations, indeuoring chiefely to deserue well of their Countrie, and to vphold the frame of ciuill policie.
            The naturall body for the preseruing of health,Dieting of the bodie. vseth the helpe of a good diet, whereby the humours are kept in their equalitie of temper: so must the state also be dieted, neither glutted with excesse, nor scanted with penurie: howbeit sith it is more dangerous, from fulnesse to fall away to leannesse, than from leannesse to spread and grow fat; I wish such fore-sight and forecast, rather to leaue than to lacke, to rise than to fal, &amp; to amend than to paire, the defect being euer worse than the excesse, as nearer to a nullitie.
            As the regiment of health in our bodies may fayle or offend,Too precise or too careles of health. in either of the extremities of being either too carelesse by licencious aduentures, or else too precise &amp; strict by needlesse restraints: so the gouernance of the states welfare may fall into the like opposite disorderings by either too much remissenes and loosenes for want of hard holding of the reines of well-ruling, or else by ouer seuere debarring of such lawfull liberty as both nature requireth, and reason denieth not. It is hard to define which of these is worse or more hurtfull. The stirring nature of man, is like the quicknesse and slipperines of the Eele, si laxes erepit, but si string as erumpit: so that (though he be hardly by either way detayned in steaddinesse) yet by the feeling of himselfe



to be too much griped, hee the more enforceth all his strength and motion for his enlargement: for my part I professe, that I had rather (as taking it to be lesse to my harme) go slackly girt, yea quite loose &amp; male cinctus, than to bee straightly pinched with tying or swadling too hard: and it is but too often found by experience, that the straight laced men, whether so held in by any compelling authoritie, or thereunto fashioned by a voluntary imposition, from their owne austeritie, doe breake forth more outragiously, and shake off the cords of obedience more desperatly, when occasion shall moue them to streine and striue for a pretenced libertie, by a course of commotion; opinionat wilfulnesse, the more check and stop it findeth, the more violently it will seeke to make his way forth, vt exeat in ingenuum suum.
            
            The bodie also must haue moderate exercise for the encrease of heat, the digesting of crudities, and the acquiring of a more actiue strength.Exercise of the bodie. The like benefit will ensue to the Commonweale, if publike occasion doe hold the people in imployment, their spirits are therby enkindled, their superfluous vanities laid away, and their valour &amp; ablenesse to atchieue high attempts much confirmed. Aristotle hath a true obseruation, That that which moueth doth not so soone putrifie as that which resteth. And the wisest Commonweales haue euen purposedly made and procured to themselues great busines, that their men should rather be refreshed &amp; purified by action, than be either consumed with ease &amp; voluptuousnes, or eaten into with the rust of a reuolting disobedience.
            Both the bodies doe also herein agree, as to be tended



and ordered as seuerall respects shal giue occasion:Tendance of the body politike according to different respects. nor wee nor our iudgement is the same when we bee children and when we be elder, when we bee full and when we be fasting, when we be sicke and when we be sound, when we be free and when we be bound; wee doe suffer more at one time than we will do at another, we be able to performe more in our good plight and strength than we dare so much as hope of in our feeblenesse, wee bee more circumspect in our feares than carefull in prosperities, and we bee often so much distracted with discrepant conditions as wee bee not alwaies alike our selues: such interchangeable times and dispositions being in the same sort incident vnto the state, there is good heeld to be taken thereof, that the counsels and prouisions bee answerable to the necessities or conueniences that ought to be regarded.
            In the bodie naturall the sustenance is not all caried to one side, or to one part,Equalitie to be obserued. to the pining and beguiling of the rest: So in the state, the nobilitie is so to bee maintayned, as that the Commons bee not wronged; and the Clergie so to be cherished, as the Laytie be not ouerlayd, but each part must be fed competently with a proportionable partition of the profits, alotting the same with such indifferencie, as the plentie of some be not the cause of penurie vnto others, nor that the euersucking veynes of some do draw drie the poorer that be in want.
            Neither yet must wee hereuppon induce any paritie or equallitie, which nature herselfe abandoneth:Against paritie to proue differences of dignitie &amp; riches. for howsoeuer (like a wise oeconomicall gouernor) she susteineth euerie part of the body with a sufficiencie, yet doth she giue (in her intentions) to some more worthie



and principall than the rest, a precedence to bee chiefly prouided for. The bloud (vnto the which the Turke compared his tribute and treasure, inferring therby the moderat expending thereof) though it be deriued and dispersed to all parts, yet is it more abundantly bestowed in the gracing of the face. The heart though it spredeth his arteries all ouer the bodie, yet hee beateth and worketh more strongly with his pulses in one place than in another. Not so much as our garments but must be fitted to our bignesse or smallnesse, obseruing therein such difference as ariseth by the diuersities of our bodies: Why then should it be grudged at, if the nobilitie and gentrie of the land (in whom the dignitie and the well-shewing countenance of the state consisteth) be better stored and furnished than the meaner of the people? why should any bodie enuie at the glorie of some selected persons, in and by whom the Soueraigne doth more manifestly discouer his purposes, make shew of his force, and expresse his affections? or why should it be disliked, that honours and fauours, riches, and preferments bee bestowed, or rather fitted (regardingly vnto the merits of the vertuous) by taking knowledge (and as it were taking measure) of their good seruice and honorable deseruings? And (to wade yet further) I will confidently make good thus much more, That as in the bodie it is a greater mischiefe not to nourish and sustaine the sound and seruiceable parts, than not to cut off the diseased and corrupted: so in the Commonweale, not to reward and aduaunce the worthie,Not to reward worse than not to punish. is more pernicious and of more dangerous consequence, than not to afflict, punish, or pare away the hurtfull and infectious: for where the one is but



spared awhile by lenitie and impunitie in some hope of amendment, the other vnrespected in his goodnesse, is so pinched by that coldnesse of entertaynment, as hee seldome or neuer can come forward and put forth any shoots of vertue. Thence will it fall out, that as in the bodie the decay or corruption of any part, is but the want of that health, soundnesse, or good temper which it ought to haue had, and imployed to the helpe and not to the hurt of the whole: So in the bodie politique, if in the better part thereof (by occasion of such discouragement, &amp; the pronenesse of men vnto naughtinesse more than vnto goodnesse) there bee a want of honestie or vertuous performances, must it not necessarily effect a generall declination from all true duties? diuerting that to the harme that should haue ben conuerted to the benefit of the state, and introducing thereby, an ouerswelling tide of sinne, corrupting and confounding all, and that meerely by the neglect of desert and vertue.
            If there bee any not yet persuaded of this different respectiuenesse to be had of men in the state,Difference of dignities and degrees. according as they differ in esteeme and worthinesse; let him yet farther bethinke himselfe of his owne different vsage of the seuerall parts of his owne bodie: doth hee not adorne some of them with silkes, veluets, purple, and cloth of gold, and yet leaueth others wholy naked, or but homely and coursely attired? he hath for the head and necke, garlands, chaynes, and iewels of rich value; where for the feet (though they do bear vp the whole) he hath but leather onely. What artificiall deuices will hee not find out, and that with his extremest cost, to grace and set forth the comlinesse of his face? and yet



hideth for verie shame some other parts vnfit and vnworthie of producing to open aspect? and were it not as vnfitting, that the dignities and degrees of reputation,Dignities ill bestowed. should be promiscuously cast abroad amongst the meaner sort of mechanicall tradesmen, as for the ornaments and dressings prouided for the better parts, to be bestowed so low as vppon the feet? Hereof my inference is, That as in our priuat, so in our publique bodie, difference of regard maketh difference of aduauncement, by a distributing iustice, which yeeldeth to euerie one (though not the same) yet his fit proportion.
            It is not therefore called a Commonwealth,Why the body politique is called a Common wealth. that all the wealth should bee common; but because the whole wealth, wit, power, and goodnesse whatsoeuer, of euery particular person, must be conferred and reduced to the common good: and that in the same sort and semblance, as the distinct members of the bodie, being ordained to different vses, do yet concurre in this consonance of intention, as to impart and referre all their helps and indeuours (to the vttermost reach of their abilities) for the procuring and preseruing of the comfort and continuance of this one bodie.
            All the members ioine their assisting aid, and effect their whole force according to their diuers functions,Mutualitie of helpe in the members. as well for the vpholding of the whole and euerie part in soundnesse, as also against a common enemie: And whatsoeuer presseth nature with any griefe, is repelled by the consent of a generall resistance. If but a thorne haue pricked the foot, how doth the eye seeke to spie it out? how doth the hand bestirre him to draw it out? how doth the head contriue to worke it out? and each



part as his power permitteth him, doth thinke to procure his owne ease by remedying the disease in another:More respect of the chiefe members. but in case any the principall or vitall parts bee much distressed, or in great danger, then (as ouermatched with a mountayne of miserie) the care, the feare, the sorrow is so farre increased, as that remedilesse of helpe, and languishing in despaire, they doe all yeeld themselues vanquished, as partakers also of that calamitie so vncurable.
            This fellow suffering, this strong vnion, and enterchanged kindnesse, shewed so louingly in the parts of the bodie, instructeth all true subiects of any countrie to the mutuall performance of all friendly offices, and to the firmest adherence against all opposing enmities, or in all perilous necessities; remembring that a common daunger alike distresseth the lesse as the greatest; but especially, to bee tenderly affected in the losse or harme likely to befall their choicest statesmen of the best account and qualitie, against whom the enemies of the state doe chiefly bend their malignant intentions,The enemies bend most against the best. euen as in our priuat combats &amp; affraies, the deadly minded foe watcheth to wound the dearest and vitall parts.
            From this founteine of natures so wise distribution and distinguishment of the parts, in sorting them so orderly to their seuerall functions, this consideration also floweth and offereth it selfe; that as there must be a proportionablenesse and a kind of vnanimitie of the members, for the aiding and adorning of the publike comprehending all: so that foule daughter of darknesse and Chaos confused and all disturbing Anarchie, is to be exiled, or rather excluded out of this compaction



of the bodie politique each part is to know and administer his owne proper worke, without entermixing or entermedling in the offices of any other. Shall the foot be permitted to partake in the point of preeminence with the head?Each part to be appointed to his owne workes. or were it seemlie for the head, leauing his state, to abase himselfe to a toyle manibus pedibus
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                  
                in the trading businesses? For each member to take vpon him all works, as it hath in nature an impossibilitie, so hath it in gouernance as great an incongruitie. And for any part to neglect the duties properly to it alotted, or to run forth of the circle within the which it is fixed (as quartering it selfe into a new diuision, by vndertaking dispatches of another nature) as it agreeth not with that so well parted, yet vniforme frame of Gods workmanship, so is it not to be suffered neither in any well contriued policie of the gouerning wisdome. The eye is nor ordeined nor apted to any other worke, than to make vse of the light by seeing; and to euery singled part there is assigned some more peculier operation or administration, from the which as if in possessionem suam venerit excludit alios. To the like confusion it tendeth if the parts be prodigiously dislocated or transferred from their proper to other vnfitting places,Parts disordered, maketh the bodie to seeme monstrous. whereof oftentimes the whole bodie getteth the name of a monster mishapen and distorted. The sences must hold their station like to Sentinels, and attend their generall in and about the head, where they be setled. And in briefe, no parts inward or outward can either do duties, or be indured elswhere, than where both for comlinesse and vse they be by natures order placed. The ciuill bodie may hereby be admonished how to dispose of the seuerall



conditions and degrees of the people, according to the difference of their breed, education, conuersation, or habitation; that imployments or aduancements be not vnmeet or preposterous, but properly and aduantagiously accommodated.Against conspiracie of the parts in the state ciuill. But of all other the loathed impes of tumult and disorder, let this be taken for the deadliest and most detestable; If any parts disdeining the rule of their soule, and disliking their subiected condition, shall not onely neglect their dutious performances, but also conspiringly complot against the head, hart, and other the noblest viols of life, to the vtter destruction of the whole bodie, by such their horrible commotions and violent conuulsions: which if it were neuer yet attempted, or once intended by any naturall members ruled by the law of their creation, how commeth it to passe, that any parts of the politicall bodie should so outragiously and sediciously betake themselues to an Anarchie, most vnnaturall and rebellious?Of the late intended Treason. I could exhibit vnto the well discerning eyes of all loiall subiects, a right representing patterne hereof, by relating the true historicall narration of the late most execrable enterprise and cunningly contriued treacherie, that euer any subiects, of any Nation, though neuer so heathen or barbarous; of any age, though neuer so earthly or ironlike; of any religion, though neuer so erronious or scismaticall; vpon any occasion, though neuer so extreamlie mouing, did against their Soueraigne and Rulers, once imagine, much lesse with enuenomed and obdurate minds intend &amp; vndertake: which neuerthelesse I rather chuse to leaue naked and vndilated to the Readers well appliing meditations, as well because I refraine to vse any



vnnecessarie excursions, as also because I do find any my facultie much too feeble to expresse (of so inhumane and bloudie a proiect) the right shape or substance: for where Hell it selfe hath imployed an whole councell of diuels to deuise an hatefull and vnheard-of villanie; there vnlesse heauen should afford the toung of Angels to declare and paint out the abomination thereof, all the oratorie of man must needs faile and be defectiue. What (though neuer so passionate) exclamations can raise sufficient admiration of Treasons so damnable? What contestations or accusations by streining all the strings of art, can reach the height of so heinous and most abhorred conspiracies? what vse can there be of any aggrauating or amplifying, when the plainest tale that can be told, may be thought to be but an Hyperbole beyond beliefe? My conceit telleth me, that (notwithstanding any the best sinceritie or integritie not possible to be controlled) the report thereof to forrein Countries, or after ages, will seeme vncredible, and that it will require a great dexteritie and perfection of art, so to deliuer it ouer, as not to haue it censured rather a malicious fiction, than a true storie. I must confesse that it is not for euery vulgar verbalist to handle or set forth such a damnable purpose of murthering a King, and that by such a murther, and such a King, and so accompanied with his decrest Queene, sweet Prince, and his whole state of Nobilitie; the verie relating or mentioning whereof, affrighteth and dawnteth my hart with horror, euen shaking the verie pen in my hand, whilest I think what a shake, what a blast, or what a storme (as they tearmed it) they ment so suddeinly to haue raised for the blowing vp, shiuering



into peeces, and whirling about of those honorable, annointed, and sacred bodies, which the Lord would not haue to be so much as touched. I haue heard of one so far affected to pouertie, as that he wished all the treasure and iewels of the world in one roome, that he might at once set tehm all on fire: Such a wish had these men so deuoted to Poperie, that they would in an instant, and in one roome, haue destroied the true riches, iewels, the maiestie and glorie of our whole state at one clap. It was a memorable crueltie of that tyrannous Emperour, that wished all the Romans to haue had but one head, that he might with one stroke haue chopped it off. Their purpose was full of the like heathenish immanitie, That hauing all the heads of this Nation assembled in honorable consultation into one place, would euen then and there haue as it were beheaded the whole Realme, and so haue induced vpon the land a miserable desolation. The tyrannous Massacre of France, (being an elder issue of that same mother Church the harlot of Rome) was inferior in furie &amp; wickednesse to this plot: They had an excuse from the warrant of aucthoritie; these out of their priuat dislikes, conspired the ouerthrow of all aucthoritie: They designed those onely to the slaughter whom they accounted and condemned as offendors in their state, these bundled vp into their butcherie the innocent, and some of their own friends also, whom they could haue no colour so to confound and ruinate: They ment the mending of their state present, and the securing of their future; these not onely the subuersion of that which now is flourishing, both in riches 
                  ••
               rituousnesse, but also a future



precipitation into a swelling surge of ensuing and vnauoydable calamities. I cannot tell whether their obdurate harts and brazen foreheds will not contradict my position, if do but say this their designement to be a sinne: This in despite of them all I will mainteine, That the verie nature of man, not seduced by the man of sinne (who by his aucthorizing dispensations, and pickpurse pardons hath made himselfe the great patron of sinne) acknowledgeth the same to be a foule and vnexcusable, a cursed &amp; most shamefull sinne: a sinne and shame that will for euer cleaue to their Religion, euen as close as the venomed shirt of Hercules, till it eate and consume the same to the hard bones: a sinne and shame that no conscience (though steeled ouer with the Romish mettall) can make so much as any colourable defence for: a sinne and shame that God himselfe of his miraculous mercie, for the honour of his name, and the loue of his truth, so happily discouered, that they might not say, Where is now their God: A sinne and shame, that we shall not need to call Diuines by any their disputings to conuince them of; but which the verie Humanists and Moralists out of the grounds of reason and learning, will make the whole world to wonder, hisse, and gnash their teeth at. And which my poore selfe (as the meanesse of my wit and erudition affordeth) euen by the comparatiue respects of the parts in the bodie, which I haue vndertaken to set forth, do condemne to the deepest dongion of hell, whence the fathers and factors of the Romish faith hath first fetched it.Against idle, vagrant, or vnptofitable people.
            
            In the bodie there is not any part so weake, so little, or so base, which God hath not framed and appointed



to some good vse; and shall there in the state bee cherished, or suffered, any so loose, idle, vagrant, and vnprofitable people, as that no vse can bee made of them for the publique behoofe? nay, that bee noysome, pernitious, combersome, and contrarious thereunto? Let vs but obserue nature, who because shee would be sure to make nothing in vaine (thereby teaching vs in the order of gouernment, to allow no needlesse or fruitles parts) hath endued and designed some one part vnto many vses. I will propound onely one instance of the hand, which serueth for so many purposes, as I thinke to resemble therunto, sometimes the souldier that fighteth, sometimes the husbandman that laboureth, sometimes the marchant that reacheth and fetcheth far and neere, sometimes the artificer, who wholy practiseth the handiecraft, sometimes the purueiour, that feedeth and releeueth our liues with needfull nutriment. This so prouident accommodating of the parts vnto many imployments, disproueth our heedlesse tollerating of these begging and shifting mates, who swarming euery where, bee so farre from doing any good in the State, as that they will doe nothing for their owne liuing.
            Neuerthelesse, I would not be so mistaken, as if by this president of natures worke in bestowing of manifold abilities vppon one part,Against ingrossing of offices. I should make way or proofe for the ouer-greedie ingrossing of too many offices into the hands of some one man; which neyther the businesse of the state may well beare, nor the stomakes of other men with contentednesse endure, nor himselfe perhaps with sufficiencie vndergoe. Therefore I must crosse any such conclusion with an apparant



difference,No need to put many offices vpon one man. disauow the similitude in that poynt, sith in the larger bodie politique there is greater store and choice of well-fitting seruitors for the many diuersities of affayres, that there is no need to huddle or heap too much vppon any one man: wherein it seemeth that nature hath trodden vs a path for our practise, and that way also hath for our imitation manifested her intention. Wee doe find, that the most industrious and instrumentall parts are giuen vs by couples, as if one (though for one worke) would not serue the turne: for example, She hath giuen vs two hands, &amp; each of them diuided &amp; adorned with seuerall fingers; as if she ment in so narrow a compasse to couch and compact a varietie of helps, for the more easie and certaine dispatch of so diuersly occurring works.
            This allotting of two parts to one function might cause in our so little bodies a great factiō,A concordāce of the parts of the body politike in their cōmon works. if the foreseeing care of nature had not also conioined them in consent, as well as in operation. Wee see both the eyes to looke both one way, the eares to conceiue alike one and the same sound, the nostrils to bee affected alike with one and the same smell, the hands ioyntly labouring at one worke, and the feet by equall paces locally mouing the body by euen length &amp; strength vprightly supporting it, and by their good agreement ioyntly acting and louingly ayding one the other: the two sides, and the two shoulders, which beare vp the high castle of the head, doe with the like matchable equalitie, and the like willing agreeablenesse entertaine their taske. I wish from my heart (though I shew but by a simily) that in the realm likewise by such concordance of the parts in each degree, might fasten so their fayth



each to other, as that the disposing of many to one seruice, did tend to a more full &amp; more sure performance of the same: so should both the ciuill and the spirituall side, together with the honourable shoulders on both sides, equally part betweene them the common care, and much importing worke of vpholding the maiestie of supreme authoritie, without any fainting or interruption: so should the eies of the wise, and the sences of the learned bee bent all one way, for discerning and increasing of truth and goodnesse, without any erronious mistaking, or wilfull reluctations: so should the meaner and ministring sort, like to the feet and hands runne the race, and catch the goale to them proposed, in making a happie kingdome through an happy people, without any either rubbes in their way by vnrulines, or desisting from their duties by a retrogradation: And so should euerie part become plyant and apt to their places and callings (receiuing like waxe from a seale the impressions of the Gouernour) to execute his designements, without either distraction by iarres, or peruersnes of opposition, or the carelesnes of a neglecting sloth.
            I must yet inferre one obseruation more of natures prouidence,In the worke of ruling, but one head. whereupon I will set my marke as chiefly to bee remembred: That albeit for the ordering and effecting of other businesses concerning the body, she hath assigned and conioyned more parts vnto one worke: yet for the supremacie of gouerning ouer all, she hath but one head; as if it were vtterly vnpossible, or vnsufferablie mischeeuous, to admit any partnership in the regall dignitie. Let vs imagine a bodie so monstrous, as whereunto two heads were at once affixed,



shall not that bodie receiue much damage by the diuision and confusion of those two heads? must not the bodie in that case either be diuided by alotting of one side to the one, and the other side to the other head? or else be wholy disseuered by a promiscuous and contentious shufling of the seuerall sinewes, forces, and operations from each head proceeding? What we as by fiction doe imagine might bee done in the naturall bodie: Man (that imagineth nothing but euill) and therefore can produce more prodigious errours than nature in her escapes hath euer patterned, hath indeed often brought to passe (though with most cursed successe) in the bodie politique. Haue we not had within this one land of England, the hideous Heptarchie of seuen heads at once? nay hath not the whole Iland of Britania,
               Britania one body needing but one head. being a bodie perfectly shaped, rounded, and bounded with an inuironing sea, beene a long time thus disseuered, and disfigured by that vnluckie dualitie the authour of diuision? vntill at the last the mightie and onely wonder working hand of God, wyping away the deformitie (not by any violent cutting off, but by a new moulding as it were of the two heads into one) hath restored it againe to his first right, imperiall, and most monarchiall greatnesse.
            Here I find the matter of Vnion to lye so full in my way,Proofes for Vnion. that euen it stoppeth my passage, forcing me (notwithstanding the exact handling thereof by others) to giue it some little touch by the addition of proofe from these my comparisons also: for doubtlesse, if in the former times two heads caused the diuiding and halfeing of the bodie; the same reason now requireth, that this one so vertuous and powerfull head



should reunite and draw againe into one, the distracted and long repugning parts. And can any of this entire and compleat body bee either so vnnaturally hard harted, or so vnconsiderat of his owne good, as finding this so happie and long desired reducement thereof vnto one head, will not seeke to be conioyned (euen in all the offices of kindnesse and releefe) rather with the whole bodie, than with the parts of one side onely? or is it fit that there should be any disseuering, siding, or disuniting by different orders, lawes, customs, and other such poynts of gouernment, where necessitie of communion in all the parts, inforceth a firmnesse of loue, a likenesse of life, and an equalitie of condition? Surely such as doe not gladly entertaine this good opportunitie to reunite that which hath so long beene sundred, seemeth to bee better pleased with the imperfection, the weaknesse and misshapen forme of the bodie vnder two heads, and with disagreeing parts, than that the whole strengthening of it selfe with a comely concordance, and vniforme subiection, should bee brought vnder the righteous gouernment of one onely soueraigne head. Therefore if they will not bee thought to dislike, that one head should rule all; let not this offend them neither, that all bee collected and incorporate into one and the same politicall gouernment.
            The bodie may haue many imperfections and deformities, yea may be bereaued of whole parts,Imperfections in the body politike, yet a bodie. and yet retaine still the name and nature of a bodie: And sundrie shifts be deuised (though not to cure) yet to couer such defects. In the steed of the naturall leg, or arme, wee stick not to fashion and affixe a wooden arme, or



leg, verie necessitie constreineth vs to make that simple supplie, when we find not otherwise any substantiall remedie. The Commonwealth likewise, may (by the losse or want of her true subiects) become stark lame, or by some foule disorders made deformed and mishapen;Shifts to supplie defects. yet hold still the style and rights of a Commonweale. Howbeit to redresse such abuses, blemishes, impotencies, or enormities, she is lightly driuen to betake her selfe vnto some mercenarie helpes,Mercenarie souldiers and straungers. as to her crowches; yea to take vnto her new lymbs, and lynages of strangers, like woodden legs to be planted amongst her owne people. The bodie when vpon any quarrell it is to combat with his enemie, vseth for more aduantage to combine with a friend:The vse of leagues betwixt differēt Countries. So when one kingdome is at variance with an other, it seemeth a wisdome not to be neglected, to enter leagues, aliances, and confederacies, with some other well chosen Nation; though it often commeth to passe, as in particuler bodies: so in whole Realmes, that as well the friendship begun for such purposes, doth proue but feeble and fickle, as also those other additaments of forrain aide, do in the end by their failing falshood giue the fall to them that trust entirely to them.
            There is a time when the bodies constitution is thought perfect and at the height, as setled in the middle point betweene redundacies, and deficiencies, hauing neither any distemper within it selfe, nor disturbance by outward wrongs: which soundnes of welfare, is manifested in externall seemings also; as in a liuely cheerfulnesse, a fresh colour, an actiue lustinesse, and such like faire blossomes of a prospering plant: The State also hath such a time,Perfection in the State. of his good estate; the



absolute happinesse whereof requireth an happier wit than mind, for the exact describing of it in all his complements: nor Plato; his imagined Idea, nor Aristotles sharpe discussings doth fully discouer so much thereof, to my apprehension, but my wishes may exceed the same, by addition of some further good. When I speak of perfection, I would patterne it by paradise, or the Ierusalem of God; but we must be faine now to account that perfect, which bewraieth least imperfection, and commeth neerest to that goodnesse which may receiue allowance.Signes of being in good estate. Therefore without reducing our conceits to any exquisite perfectnes, (imitating the Phisitions, who will neuer yeeld the bodie to be in perfect health) we may with them take our coniectures, from the signes of health: So as where we see publique concordant ioying, peace, and plentie kissing each other, sumptuous shewes, triumphant exercises, magnificent solemnities, and such other apparances of good liking; there it seemeth that health and good temper hath attained the golden meane, preuailing against all, either homebred or forrain iniuries. But as that rule in Phisick is not to be lightly regarded, though it be not generally beleeued,The best plight most to be mistursted. That when health is at his height, then is the bodie neerest to decline into diseases: so lightly when any kingdome is in his flowing, and flourishing fortunes, and in the pride of his prosperitie, then the more eminent is his happines, the more imminent is his danger, and such his fulnesse is fuller of feare than it can giue securitie. And againe, as the Phisitions (notwithstanding) do confesse good signes to be deceiuable,Signes infer no certeintie. and that themselues be often illuded by the imposture of such beguiling



shewes: So let it also be acknowledged, and considered, that in the state, there may be somtimes a well carying or setting of a face vpon the matter, where inwardly it is fretted with the festring of some swelling and foule Impostume.
            Now (me thinketh) I haue opened a fit passage for my pen into a discourse very large, and scantly to bee limitted; Of the health requisite, the diseases incident, and the remedies, applyable to a Commonweale, that herein also, I may make good my comparison thereof to the body naturall. There is none either so witlesse, or so carelesse, that considereth not of the necessitie of health,Health, how necessarie in both bodies. which where it wanteth, there can neither be fore-thinking of affayres, nor courage to attempt, nor strength to persorme, nor cheerfulnesse in shew, nor manfulnes in deed; but in the steede of these a drowping dismaiednsse, deiected weaknes, and a yeedling faintnesse, deliuereth ouer the bodie into a verie euill, if not forlorne condition. And surely where the bodie politique hath not his health, as being either tainted with infectious corruptions, or infested with publique greuances, there all things quickly runneth awrie, for want both of councell to contriue, and power to doe, what in such cases is behoueable: The haughtynes of valour is turned all to timerousnes the care of the common good, to a heedlesse negligence; the forwarding of iust actions, to a languishing in his owne afflictions; and his ioint force of peace &amp; loue, into a disseuering and tearing a sunder of all his ioints. Then herein let both the bodies agree, that without health, they haue neither mind of their businesses, nor vse of their abundance, nor meanes of well doing, nor ioy of themselues.



The bodie is not said to be in health, if any part thereof be greeued;Griefe in any one part, putteth the whole out of health. in so much that somtimes a paine in the finger, or toe, so outragiously disquieteth the whole bodie, as that we could be content to forgo all the wealth or ioyes we haue, to be freed from that one torment. This may giue proofe vnto the State, not to neglect, but rather to redeeme by the dearest meanes, the welfare of his members, lest in the anguish of them, it selfe do feelingly fare the worse.
                  Aristotle Ethic. lib. 3. 
               Chyron that wise centaure, ouercome with the paine of an vlcer, (renouncing immortalitie) wished rather to die than to endure, In subiectes such an vlcer is discontentednesse,Discontentednesse. the sting whereof is so sharpe, as pricking them on in perplexities and despaires, maketh them vtterly carelesse of life or lyuing, and so to attempt the recouerie of their comforts, though it be with hazard of a vniuersall ruine.
            That health which the bodie hath by the strength and goodnes of nature,Originall orders, the best preseruatiues of health in the State. is firmer and to be preferred before that, which by a shift of art is peeced and procured: so each kingdom is in better case when it holdeth his originall constitutions by his owne Lawes and customes, than when by the swaruing from them it is corrupted, and then constrained by extremitie vnto new prouisions.Alterations, how daungerous. Hence it is that all alterations (especially in the chiefe and substanciall points) be accounted verie perilous, because the imutation of that which is inate and primatiue, is intended to tend to the decay and destruction of nature. How full of daunger changes be, may bee shewed by the difference we doe find in our diet; the meat, drinke, and ayre, whereunto we haue not bene vsed, offendeth our bodies, and subuerteth



our health.
            Those things whereunto we haue bene most accustomed do lesse harme, and are not to be exchanged, no not for the better;Nature best brooketh things accustomed. daily vsage agreeably apting the one vnto our likings (though not of so commendable a qualitie) where the other (though in reason it may seeme more applyable) yet is both distrustfully entertayned as vnacquainted, and hazerdable to disturbe by his newnesse: whereof the Phisicions haue made this rule, Si assuetis mederi possis non tentanda noua. And the reason why the seasons of the spring and fall are aptest to bring sicknesse, is onely the interchangeable varietie of weather then working vpon our tendernesse and chilnesse.
            There must be a leasurely and aduised proceeding in euery alteration:Alterations must not be suddē or wholy, but by degrees and by parts. nature hath left vs a patterne thereof in the whole course of our life, who from infancie to strength, and from thencè againe to feeblenesse &amp; age, and from one complexion to another, doe proceed by softly steps, and so stealingly, as the change cannot presently be discerned: admonishing vs, that when we be disposed to alter any thing, wee must let it grow by degrees, and not hast it on too suddenly. It is well noted of some Philosophers, That if a Scythian were in an instant transported into India, he could not possiblie liue: so if without an orderlie passing by a meane, the state from on extremitie should be altered to another, it would certeinly infer a dissolution and dissipation of that it was before: wherein the proportion of the perils that may befall, suiteth with the proportion and degrees of the alteration; in so much, as the more or lesse violent and vnnaturall the change is, the more or



lesse the danger thereof is to be misdoubted; euen as the taking of the more or lesse cold, after more or lesse heat, doth more or lesse endaunger our health.
            The mutabilitie of this earthly state stirred by the diuersitie of causes,Cases of alteration. admitteth no such certeintie or stabilitie in either of the said bodies, as can quite keepe off or exclude alterations. Let vs then as in the naturall, so in the politicall bodie gouerne the question of change with such choice &amp; discretion, as vnlesse either vrgent necessitie constraine, or euident vtilitie do entise our assent, we may still retaine our wonted orders and vsages with all permanent firmenesse, not affecting or enduring any nouelties: which besides their misdoubted harmefulnesse at their first entring, will aske a continued time of triall, for their gaining of aucthority and acceptation. But where these respectes of an enforced compulsion, or of a gainfull consideration shall preuaile; how can it be gainsaid, that the feare of the one, or the loue of the other, (euen of a tender sence in nature) should not persuade a voluntarie condescending to so well warranted immutations?
            I hold it better phisick to preserue health, than to restore it; and a more commendable care to preuent,Better keep health, than recouer it. than to cure diseases: so it is a greater wisdome to keep a kingdome in his good gouernment, than to amend it when it is out of order; and to prouide aforehand against mischiefes, than to redresse what is become amisse. We do vsualy account it good wisdome in our health to prouide for sicknes;To prouide in prosperitie, for aduersitie. and then to furnish our selues with all such necessaries as may best besteed vs, when we shall be either threatned or assaulted therwith. Hereof also the ciuill bodie doth make this vse,



as in the seasons of the plentie, to store vp against scarcitie, and in the times of peace to get and gather together more plentifully the many preparations of warre. To discerne an approching euill betimes,Time preuention. and to stop the spread thereof before it become through continuance vncureable, is a like in either of the said bodies, a foresight most necessarie. We see that a verie whelke doth often breed into a great sore, a small bruze into a greeuous fistula,Of small beginnings, great mischiefes. and a little distemperature into an extreame feuer: Such shaking fits and horrible commotions haue bin felt in the bodie of the Realme, and haue risen from contemptible beginnings, to vncorrigible confusions; which who so well weyeth, must be forced to conclude a necessitie of timely care and circumspect preuention, for auoiding or resisting thereof. He that neglecteth dangers, because the means that importeth or threatneth the same be but small, forgetteth what great plagues, the frogs, lice, flies, and grashoppers, brought vpon the land of Aegypt; nay, let him not account so slightlie of any euill (though neuer so little in shew) as not to watch it well, for feare of the worst. We haue a common saying, That an euill weed groweth apace, and as vsuall a practise to roote it out as soone as it sheweth: when one is out of the way, if he be not streight reduced, it is hard to say how far he will straggle; and when the bodie is but a little crazie, if help be not sought, who can tell what extreamitie may ensue. Such petite euils (reckoned of as scant regardable) do often (because their venemous qualitie is not presently perceiued) aduantage themselues by the foolish sufferance of such as should suppresse them; wherebyAgainst Tolleration. the way hath bin made for the introducing



of the tolleration of them, euen when they haue growen more vntollerable: for, such their vnderpropping Patrons, as in their first springing, and (as it were) in the supposed harmlesnesse thereof, afforded them perhaps some little countenancing fauour, will still be presumed of to beare towards them a certaine tender and relenting fancie, tending to their defence. And in verie deed, such as compassionatly do encline their affectiōs to beare with euils, cannot readily find a degree of stay; but are likely enough to hold on with them, as well in their offensiue and excessiue, as in their vnespied or neglected naughtinesse; like to Milo that had caried the calfe so long, as that he still caried it when it was become an Oxe. I know it to be propounded by some Polititians, that some euils must be tollerated in the State, like as dregs and grosse humors be entermixed with the bloud, which they affirme to be better for health, than if the bloud were all pure and clean without them. But (by their good leaue) this their instance is idle and impertinent; for if it be better for the bloud so to be, then it is no euill, but meerely good: and so out of this question of tolleration, I will fetch my ground from a far more aucthorized principle, which is: Tollite malum e vobis, and libera nos a malo, And will confesse my selfe in this point a Stoycall statesman, by auouching no euill to be so small, (cloak it or extenuate it neuer so much) but that the (Tollite) barreth it of Tolleration; and the (Libera) setteth vs at libertie, to haue nothing to doe therewith. I know not what nice mitigations, or constructions (by their fauours) they may applie to this word (Euill) but well I wot, that in the prescribed praier taught vs by Christ,



in that verie tearme of (euill) is included and conteined the Diuell himselfe: And therefore whatsoeuer we assuredlie resolue to be euill, is as absolutely vnsufferable, as any the limbs or deriued issues of the diuell. Now (lest I should be charged by following of a by-path) to haue digressed and raunged from my theame, I will reuert to the proofs and appliances borrowed from the bodie. Let me know of them, whether their stomacks be so strong, as when they be clogged with heauie meats which they cannot digest, yet will hold and still deteine the same, neuer once striuing to cast them vp? or is there any of them, that in his owne bodie will with his tollerating patience endure a disease or griefe, if it lyeth in his power to remedie and rid the same? nay more, admit he be thereby but a little troubled, and not endamaged at all, yet will he not (for that trouble onely) seek redresse thereof? let it be but the itching of some salt humour, or a fleabyting (by a sleight touch of the skin, starting all the spirits) can he be so contented, as not to attempt to ease himselfe of such disquieting? Then, from the warrant of God, the sence of nature, the directions of wisdome, the necessitie &amp; dignitie of the State, (which is not only to remoue his opposites, but to aduance it selfe to all perfection) let vs abandon all such party-coloured and ambodexter tollerations, not fitting the Iustice or dignitie, or good of the Commonwealth. Neuerthelesse, lest I should too much lay open my weaknesse, both in discretion by a presumptuous asseueration,Cases admitting some sufferance of euill. and in iudgement by propounding that for absolute, which may perhaps be thought to accept of some exceptions and conditions; I must annex hereunto



unto some respectiue mitigation, if not a seeming retractation. It cannot be obscure, but that in a case of vnauoydable necessitie, to auoide thereby the extreamitie of a greater euill, the lesser may (though not likingly yet permittingly, though not absolutely yet in some manner, though not perpetuallie yet for a season) receiue a bearing or forbearing conueiance, though not an authorizing approbation. And I must impute it wholy to our impotency, that is so ouerladen with the manifold cumber of euils, and those often of opposite natures, as that we be forced by the repulsing of the worst, to make a seeming shew of electing of lesser; scant reckoning that to be any euill at all, which by freeing of vs from a deadlyer mischiefe, may bee deemed to haue wrought vnto vs our wel-accepted good. And sith I haue reduced my reason to this degree of relenting, I must seeke to make some probabilitie of farther prouing this point, by the looking also vpon my first propounded patterne: Our naturall bodies doe willingly and with a kind of chosing, endure some diseases, because they find the same to free them from other more extremely daungerous. The opening of an issue stoppeth the entrance and breed of many grieuous sicknesses: and nature seemeth oft pleased to suffer, yea and to entertayne some enemies contentedly, for the obtayning and purchasing of an ensuing founder welfare. Therefore for a resoluing conclusion whereuppon to insist, I will reconcile any my surmised repugnances with this explayning distinction: Such euils, as either through an impossibilitie of remouing are growne necessarie, and so require rather fortitude to indure them, than any prudencie to make choice of



them, or that by any helpfull vse whereunto they serue, doe seeme to haue put off their former nature, as becomming phisicke vnto vs, partly may, and partly will haue our sufferance. But as I take it, in the very terme of tolleration, is meant and implyed, a dispensing with and vpholding of such euils, as being confessed to bee meerely and altogether of that qualitie, yet neither so forceth vs by the restreint of our power, but that wee may suppresse them; neither induceth vs by the apparance of any behoofe or helpfulnesse, to yeeld them fauour. The discerning of which differences in any particular instances, is fitlier recommended to the aduisednesse of the discreet gouernours, than to bee left to the temeritie of any ouer venturous and peremptorie preiudicator.
            To conclude this point of health: It is so precious and of so vnualuable a worth,We may hurt to heale. as that when it is not so perfect as wee would haue it, or when it is somewhat impaired, we do not sticke willingly to do to our selues farther hurt, to the end to heale our infirmities the more soundly. Yea, when wee haue no cause at all to cōplaine, as being of a constitution not to be disliked, yet doe we then take phisicke for a purpose to preuent sicknesse that may ensue, and to confirme the continuance of our health: So in our bodie of the Commonweale it is not to be disliked, that (though there be no great fault found, and all things seeme to stand in good order) yet now and then physicall courses be vsed, by opening some veine, by purging of superfluities, and putting to payne some part thereof, for the more certeintie of the generall good: that not onely diseases themselues be auoided, but euen all feare and suspition



may be preuented to the preseruing and assuring of an inuiolable stabititie of the publique quietnesse. Neuerthelesse as in the bodie it is a safe regard not otherwise to moue the humours, than there is likelihood to rid and conquer them: so in the state it requireth a iudicious and ponderous consulting when and how to stirre and atempt such medicinall trialls. Aduisednesse aduentureth not without aduantage, knowing that the awaked Dog (not well awed or ouermatched) will the more insultingly be enraged.
            The diseases that may annoy or indaunger the state, are more than I am able to recount,The diseases of the State. much lesse can tell how to cure; neither would I (by a more single comparing thereof to the diseases of the bodie) giue cause to bee censured, as either superstitiously curious, or superfluously busie-headed. This field is spacious, and incloseth a large circuit of plentifull matter for discourse: and I take it to be no lesse difficultie succinctly to comprehend, vnder any heads of diuision, the discrepant multiplicitie of diseases in the politique, than it is in the naturall bodie; wherein (as daily experience propoundeth it vnto vs) notwithstanding the almost innumerable and most industrious discoueries of the learned, in so many reuolutions of ages, yet still more and more diuersities doe start vp and occurre to consideration. I see the pathway and method for an orderly entrance into a treatise of that nature, by the distinct rehersall of euerie the seuerall diseases, either generall to the whole, or proper to any part: but as I must confesse my feeblenesse, standing confounded by the verie sight of the immensitie thereof, so do I humblie yeeld my meannesse to be farre vnapt to intermeddle, where



the paines and exquisitnes of some greater Patriot may be well bestowed. So much onely (as in passage) must needs bee mentioned, as may serue for a conductor or leader to helpe the rest forward.
            Diseases arise as in the body naturall by distemper of humours;How they doe arise. so in the politicall, by disorder of manners: and as in the bodie naturall they doe hinder, peruert, and corrupt the orderly actions of nature; so in the politicall they do impeach, infringe, and resist the proceedings and regiment of a iust gouernance. But as all diseases are not alike either for sharpnesse of payne,Differences in faults. or likelihood of danger: so neither are all offences equall, either for the hainousnesse of crime, or for the harme that can thereof ensue; a stitch in the side, a pricking in the eye, or a shooting in the sinewes, are eager and extreame griefes, yet not so dangerous as the dropsies, palsies, or appoplexies: so be the fierce and smart contentions of the learned (in matters not of greatest moment) exceeding troublesome to the State; yet no way comparable for danger to Atheisme, Popery, and disloyaltie.Against equalitie of sinne. Punishment must bee proportionable to the offence. The inequalitie of diseases condemneth the Stoicks equalitie of sinne, and where the faults be not equall, it seemeth reasonable, that the magistrat also must proportion his corrections with like inequalitie, euen as the Phisicion must varie his cure according to the greatnesse or smalnesse of the griefe. The diseases of the skinne though they require remedie (because they be diseases) yet they need not so much tendance, plying, or looking vnto, as the gnawing and tearing pangs of the heart.
            
               Outward euils not so dangerous as inwardThe hurts or diseases which the body receiueth by any outward meanes, as by heat, or cold, by wounds or



bruises, or by ouerheauie loadings, or labouring, and such like; as they may more easily be before auoyded, so they may more readily be after cured; likewise hath each kingdome against forraine daungers, both better prouision to preuent them, and more aduantages to repell them: but griefes springing, spreading, and ranckling within, being both long in growing, as hidden and vnespied, and also setled in the entrailes and vitall parts, surpriseth more suddenly, vanquisheth more violently, and tormenteth more vntollerably.
            As against all diseases of the naturall bodie the skill and application of Phisicke is ordained;Laws the phisicke of the state, &amp; dependeth of the soueraigne authoritie. so against the corruption of manners in the politicall bodie, wholesome lawes be prouided: whereof where the more bee made, the more it argueth the sinfulnesse of that people, as the vse of much phisicke argueth much distemper. And as phisicke rightly vsed is but an assistant, or coadiutor vnto nature, by the stirring vp and strengthning of the oparatiue vigor and powers of the soule, who then hauing his potentiall faculties so helped and releeued, digesteth, repulseth, and ouercommeth his annoying foe, performing the cure and conquest himselfe: So the lawes and prouisions against offences in the State (like to a well directed Phisicke) are to range vnder the regiment of the Soueraigne with a seruiceable subalternation, recognizing him as the principall Phisicion for the redressing or remedying the maladies of the bodie politique. Neuerthelesse nature, reason, and all good order admitteth or rather enioyneth all the parts, as well by their duties, as by a certaine tendernesse and sympathie, to conioine any their kindest and soundest aydes both for the repelling of all impediments



or oppositions against authoritie, and for the adding of strength thereunto, to perfect the worke of suppressing vice, and of aduauncing the iustice, the safetie and preseruation of the Commonweale. Let it then bee allowed, that all lawes, as well in their first enacting, as in their daily execution; and all magistracie, as well in decreeing as in gouerning, is dependant and secondarie to the soueraigntie. Such vndergouernours or subphisicions of the commonweale, hauing vnder their charge so worthy a subiect as the states happinesse, and enabled by their Soueraigne with a portion of his power, to reforme disorders, and rectifie what is peruerted; ought regardantly to their place of so great a trust, to be the more painfull, faithfull, &amp; carefull in their cures.The meanest officers do minister phisicke to the state. Not so much as the meanest ministers and seruitors vnder authoritie, no not the Constables, Bailifes, Iurors, and such like (being smaller sprigs and twigs in the stocke of Iustice, and vsed for the inquirie, attaching, presenting, and conuicting, in tryall of transgressours and malefactours) but bee to know, that their imployment in their seuerall attendances, tendeth to the necessarie amending, purging, phisiking, and reforming of the ciuill bodie, and that therefore they are to make a conscience, &amp; to stand vpright in their diligence and dutie.
            
               The cause why magistracy is oft repugned at.The negligence, naughtinesse, and vnskilfulnesse of some Phisicions occasioneth many to be both afraid to deale with them, &amp; to condemne their profession and practise, as vnnecessarie: So, manie there bee that taking offence at the vnsufficiencie or corruptions of some magistrats and officers of iustice,Necessitie of magistracie. either vtterly denie the lawfulnesse of their calling, or at the least



spurne and repine at their administration; in so much as the Recipe of the Phisicion, and the Precipe of the Magistrat, bee lightly alike irkesome and displeasing. Howbeit, as hee that loketh into naturall Philosophie must needs find pregnant proofes for the vpholding of Phisike, so he that studieth morall Phllosophie, will acknowledge his verie Alpha and Omega,
               Magistrats not to be discouraged, or giue ouer their cure. to be the setting vp of magistracie. And as it is but the peeuishnes and queasinesse of the diseased that will abide no Phisike, so is it the wilfulnesse and malecontencie of the wicked, that will not come vnder lawes. But the Phisicions do not therefore giue ouer their patient because hee is vnruly, but rather handleth him more roughly: So Magistrats must not desist from the duties of their offices for the waywardnesse and vnaptnesse of the people, but the more stir vp their spirits &amp; forces against them with all austeritie.
            The whole worke of Phisike is either to continue health when wee haue it,The likenes of the worke of magistrats and of Phisicions. or to restore it when it is wanting: So the Magistrats function is either to hold all vpright when the state is in a good case, or to recouer and recure that which shall become vnsound. They both in each of their professions, and in euerie of their particular practises, doe (consonantly to natures rule) prescribe as well the hurtfull to bee eschewed, as the helpefull to be taken; and they both bee furnished at all points with good choice and varietie of medicines applyable occasionally to the sundrie sorts of griefes.Sundrie sorts of medicines in the state ciuill. They haue some that be Panchresta, generall for all assayes, accommodable to any disease; they haue some that be meerely peculier for one or verie few infirmities, and bee respectiue to some one part; they haue



some, which for their as well safenesse as vertue bee termed Benedicta by the helpe wherof they both conceiue hope of helpefull successe, and assurance from all endangerings: They haue some extremely forcible, euen Eradicatiua, pulling vp by the roots the firmely implanted, and predominantly preuayling humours: They haue some which be preparatiues, seruing but to make way, and worke an aptnesse for the stronger ensuing remedies: They haue some comfortatiue and cordiall, to assist the softnesse of nature against ouercharging assaults: They haue some restoratiue, to repaire the decaies, and raise againe the deiected estate of health: They haue some consuming corrosiues, to eate out what is become dead and vnsensible: They haue some soporiferous to enduce a sleeping dulnesse and stupiditie, whilest cures of great aduenture must be effected: They haue some lenetiue, to asswage excessiue and raging paines: They haue some exasperating heaters, to digest and draw out the cores of corruption: They haue some drying consumers, to waste away the superfluous confluence of any annoying matter: They haue some attractiue openers, to loose and draw forth any inwardly infixed festerings: They haue dispersers &amp; dissoluers of any gathered together or swelling putrifactions: They haue repercussiues, to suppresse and repell all beginning outrages: They haue expellers of all that is hurtfull and burdenous, cleansing the verie fountaynes of euill: They haue preseruatiues against all venemous and infectious contagious: They haue substantiall consolidators of the dissolued and apostumed parts, reducing all agayne to the health and vnitie of nature; and they both do



enterchangingly vse or administer all or any of these, according to the many different qualities, malice, degrees, disposition, state, and condition of diseases.
            The Phisition is not so strictlie tied to the vsuall forme or composure of his receits and prescriptions,In altering of punishment, what may be left to the Magistrat. but that he doth often alter the same in particuler persons, as he is induced by the obseruation of sundrie circumstances, signes, and accidents: Such a discretion (some thinketh) the Magistrat might be trusted with, that all offences comming vnder one head of law, should not receiue alike the same vnalterable censuring; but that vpon aduised consideration of diuersities, sometimes there be vsed quallifications, dispensations, and mitigations, and somtimes againe an encrease and addition of paine should be deuised, as the quallitie or manner of the fault shall deseruedly giue occasion: For example, doth not Iustice require that where one felonie is of a more hainous nature than an other, or one Treason more foule and horrible than another, the same should be condignly rewarded with an extraordinarie seueritie, beyond the letter of the law? except we should respectiuely to such inequallitie make more, and these different lawes, which should distinguishingly set forth diuersities of punishment, as the hainousnes of desert shall giue cause, and not wrap vp all alike vnder one generall title, binding them to one and the same recompensing condemnation. But whether is the better to make more choice of prescribed phisicke, (which by the multiplicitie of diuers respects might grow too infinite) or to allow more libertie to the Phisitions in sorting their appliances to the inequallities aforesaid, Id Deus aliquis viderit,


               
This is proponed for a truth perpetuall, vniuersall, and vnresistable, that where difference of considerations maketh a Maius and Minus in any fault, the punishment also should be proportionable by the intention or remission of lenitie or austeritie.
            The States Phisitions after the order and skill of phisick naturall,Points to be obserued of the states Phisition, and first of the manner of the disease. be diligently to obserue, in what manner each disease taketh or setleth, and how the same may be particularly encountred; that he may the better (for Militat omnis Medicus) so with Ambuscadoes beset the way, and prepare resistance to intercept or interrupt it in his courses, that in what sort soeuer it shall approch, or giue the onset, it may be strongly met withall, and fitly confronted with his contrarie: for right sagely doth their wisdomes discerne,Curing by contrarie. that as in the naturall, so in the politike bodie, the remediyng of any maladies is the more readily performed, by the repelling thereof with their directest opposites. But for as much as without a discouerie of the right cause of any disease, it cannot be well discerned or resolued, where or how to set foot to make head against it; it is behoueable studiously to find out the beginnings,The cause must be first knowne. the entrings, the breedings, and the first occasioning causes of each sicknesse, that in the contriuing of the cure thereof, it may be combatted correspondently. Neither is it to be thought lesse necessarie, exactly to know the constitution and complexion of the bodie politique,The complexion to be knowne. that in the right applying of remedies, it may vndeceiueably be conceiued how (according to the diuersities therof) medicines may be ministred either stronger, or weaker, speedier or flower, oftner or seldomer, for the aduantage of preuailing. Yea it seemeth



also requisite that the be well seen in the obseruation of times and seasons,Seasons to be obserued. for the more fortunate effecting of his intended cures: for like as in priuat, so in publike grieuances there is a certaine point of opportunitie to be watched, and taken hold on, sorting more fittingly to the furtherance of such good indeuours. Besides I do not see but (for the manner of his ministring) it may vnto him as vnto the Phisition be allowed to vse (to gaine an acceptation of his receipt) a kind of beguiling loue,To minister the medicines in pleasing manner. by sweetning and giuing of a more pleasing reliefe to his remedies, that the same so kindlie accomodated, may haue rather the welcome of a friend, than be abhorred as an enemy. One skill more he is yet to borrow of the Phisition, which is, the diligent noting and distinguishing of each part from other, by the extent of their nature,To know perfectly the bodie and all the parts. by their proper place, by their different workings, by their adherence and mutuall respects, or by any other their discrepant proprieties; lest he do through such ignorant mistaking vnaptly misapplie, to the hurt of one, what he had consideratly prepared for the good of another: he is to haue as penetrating an insight, as carefull an ouerlooking, and as particuler a knowledge of each thing considerable in the ciuill bodie, as the Anatomist hath in the serching and seuering of euery veine, arterie, or synew, or in the describing and bounding out of euerie the parts, passages, offices, or actions, in the bodie naturall. In his tendance and care though hee be to haue the whole in a generall suruey, espying and amending whatsoeuer requireth the correction of any remedies; yet is he more circumspectly, and with all watchfulnesse, to looke vnto such diseases which



harmeth and distresseth the best and vitall, yea those roiall parts of Nobilitie and Magistracie,To haue greatest care of the best parts. (where the soule in sort seateth and sheweth it selfe) not onely because the in-dwelling (as it were) of so great a guest, deserueth a well clensed puritie and soundnes; but for other also no lesse remarkable respects, of the consequentiall mischiefes thereof,Great mens faults most perilous, and most to be respected. arising to the residue of the bodie, (sith when any tender or noble part is ill affected, or out of order) all the rest be therewithall afflicted; as both partaking heauily with the vnrest, grieuances, and passions thereof, and also filled with the annoying fluxes vpon them vnburdned. Let vs for the cleerer demonstrance of this matter; cast our eyes and imaginations yet more markingly, vpon the bodie naturall, wherein when the distemperature of vnequally sorted humours haue inuaded and possessed any chiefe part, the disease therein bred, or setled, becommeth generall, extending a touch and taint ouer all; the helping functions thereof be withheld, as restrained by such obstructions. In the steed whereof his infection is sucked and deriued all abroad, to the corrupting and peruerting of whatsoeuer hath any dependancie or affinitie therewith; yea so far forth, as not onely the common sence by such disturbance misconceiueth his apprehensions, but also that reason it selfe is wholy beguiled and misled; with some rauing error, allowing the furmised, in steed of the reall good: so as the whole bodie therby is vexed with giddinesse and tumults: So when great men of a better condition, and higher degree, shall grow humerous, opinionate, and factious, (besides their withdrawing of their faith, alleageance, and former good seruices)



they doe not only seduce the vnskilfull and vnruly Commons, but also traine on with their suggestion of colourable causes, some officers of publique trust (as parts of the reasonable power) to adhere vnto them in their misconceiuing aduentures, till all be endaungered by such mutinous confusion.
            But hauing dwelt too long in the description of this disease (for the remedying whereof, preuention is the best prescription) what I haue farther to deliuer touching the diseases of the State, or the likenes which they haue with them of the bodie, or how to carrie or direct the manner of tendance or ordering of them; I must be faile more compendiously to couch the infinitenes thereof within the compasse of some short positions, lest raunging too far, I be offensiuelie tedious, orseeking to match all, I mar all by making more a doo than I need.1 Diseases in the nobler parts most to be looked to. The forenoted diseases setled in the nobler parts, are the more principally to be prouided for, and it is ordinarie to withdraw the anguish thereof, to some of the lesse principall, yea though it should be with torments of incision, burning, or ligature.2 Where the cause is inward. Where the greife is outward, and the cause inward, it is the surest course of curing to begin at the remouing of the inward cause, whereby the fountaines of supplie may be dried vp,3 Where the cause is vnknowne. and the braunching euill more easelie withered away. When the disease proceedeth from vnknowen causes, it is more to be suspected and feared, because it mateth and amazeth the Phisition himselfe, finding either no apparance of reason,4 Where the disease feedeth it selfe from other parts adioyning. how to make resistance or applying hazardably with likelyhood of as well hurting as helping. It is vsuall that a disease setled in one part, feedeth it selfe by sucking the corruption



from other parts adioyning; wherein for the timely cutting off of such a confluence, to make a strong faction, it is likewise vsuall to comfort and make good the parts adiacent, that the griefe more singly accompanied, may the more soundly be encountred. The diseases that be inueterate &amp; oflong continuance asketh a long healing,5 Diseases inueterate. and be seldome so soundly remedied, but they will reuert, and ioyne with any new grieuance, and be lightly then more exasperate and cumbersome than before, or than the new it selfe. The relaps into a disease from which wee haue been lately recouered,6 Relaps into any disease. doubleth the perill of the first sicknesse, being aduantaged by the weaknesse and poore case which it had formerly brought vs vnto. Some diseases taken in time are easily helped,7 To applie cure in time. which if they be suffered to run on, and through our heedlesnesse confirme themselues, do as easilie grow vncureable; and where a small matter at the first might restore health, there after some continuance the medicine will come too late. Such diseases as be infectious,8 Infectious diseases. and do spread far and neer, are to be auoyded by all meanes, as scant to be helped by any meanes, seeing that they force the Phisitions themselues to flight, not daring to entrude venterously into the thickest daunger, and when they be chased away, or hide themselues, vpon whom our hope of help relyeth, what can be expected but remedilesse miserie? The diseases that bring with them a depriuation of sence,9 Diseases depriuing sence. without any feeling or acknowledging of sicknesse, argueth a great vnlikelyhood of recouerie, because nature yeeldeth her selfe as contented,10 Diseases comming suddenlie. and no wayes opposing thereunto. When sicknesse commeth suddenly and vnexpected,



the verie violence of that surprise so daunteth the hart, as that the fort will be lost before the forces be assembled. The disease that haunteth vs, and whereunto we be accustomed,11 Diseases wherunto we be accustomed. we do watch and obserue verie diligently, that we may meet with it at euery turne, and turne away his rigor, before it can get the masterie, and against it we be better prepared, with vsuall applications. The disease that is vniuersall, affecting the whole bodie,12 Diseases of the whole bodie. awaketh &amp; stirreth all the parts to bring together their concordant aide, and is the more caringly to be withstood, because it aduentureth the whole at one stake. Where the diseases seemeth remedylesse, and of desperat condition,13 Diseases desperate. there it is permitted and aduised to minister desperat medicines. Vncureable diseases shame and foile the Phisitions, and then doth it go hard with them,14 Diseases vncurable. when the patient wholy depending vpon their help, Iaieth the blame vpon their vnsufficiencie; where contrarywise, if they help at a pinch (all seeming past help) then doe they (as it were) play their prizes, &amp; make themselues well esteemed, and much renowmed. In the diseases of great men,15 Diseases of great men require more help and aduise. and those grieuous and daungerous, the whole colledge of Phisitions is consulted with; for the greater the cause or person is, the more will the attendance and assistance of Councell, Iudges, and Magistrates concur for the suppressing of such raging fits, by timely remedies. Many diseases haue an eager appetite to those meats which are fittest to encrease their force,16 Diseases made worse by feeding on that they desire. and it is a part of the cure appertaining thereunto, to restraine the patient from the vse of such hurtfull food; as if a mad man were to bee kept from a sword, he that is aguish from wine, the seditious from



seducing books, and traiterous complottors, and the vngouerned from riches and honour. Such diseases as detecteth and discouereth themseluesby some certaine signes whereby they may be knowne,17 Diseases discouered in their signes. may be sooner suppressed; and the verie assuaging or altering of those signes, doth often weaken, vanquish, and driue away the disease it selfe. Where a disease is particular only to one part,18 Destruction of members in any disease, when to be vsed. as to the eye, the hand, foot, or such like, the losse wherof inferreth not the destruction of the whole; there, rather than a continuall molesting &amp; annoying grieuance should encumber the ioyes of life, the part wherunto such paine sticketh &amp; is so affixed, as that it cannot be remoued or remedied, were better to be pulled out, cut of, &amp; disseuered frō the bodie: howbeit much extremitie is to be abidden, and many waies for healing are to be tried befor it com to so hard a passe, as to harden the hart to endure such violence. Manie diseases are dissolued and ouercome meerly by the strength of nature,19 Diseases oft dissolued by nature. that the Phisicions ayd is not implored at all: and many againe because their nature hath beene too much trusted vnto, and Phisicke hath bene neglected or loathed, maketh a conquest ouer both. The excesse of humours, will seeke either to settle in some principall part,20 Diseases to be forced to break outwardly. as in a fortified place, entrenching the same with strong obstructiōs; or els outwardly to get an head, which (if they cannot by scattering bee dispatched) are to beeforced to breake out rather than to fester within. Some diseases haue a propertie like the Adder that turneth to be a Serpent, being chaunged after a while from being the same it was into an other new and different worser than it selfe.21 Diseases growing to a worse nature than they were. Most diseases haue certaine degrees &amp; standing points



of either encrease or declination, and according as nature is comforted and seconded by the helpes of Phisicke, so they eyther slacke their sharpnesse,22 The state or standing point of a disease. or become outragious, after they haue once touched and attained to those poynts. Yet there resteth one rule that ruleth all the rest, which is, That euery disease desireth his proper cure;23 Euerie disease must haue his proper cure. wherein if there bee any missing or mistaking, the mischiefe will bee this, That the weakening of nature by that which is wrong applyed (for such phisicke not fitting the disease, worketh vpon nature) must necessarily augment the power and perill of the sicknesse. This position is of a much importing consequence, and (howsoeuer I leaue all the former to the applying and moralizing of the Reader) this I may not so suddēly forsake, or lightly passe ouer: it cōcerneth the skil of the Phisiciō, who hath our liues in his hands.
            There bee sometimes such nimble headed Pragmatickes,Against vnskilfull Pragmatickes that taking vpon them to be great entermedlers in state affaires, do for want of grounded knowledge in the politicall science, make many foule escapes: whom I may resemble to the empericke Phisicions, who hauing bene brought vp onely in an experimentall prentiship, do seldome apply that which is proper, but wholy trusting to their ordinarie receipts, &amp; not able to looke into the right nature of the disease, or the diuers variations therof, or the complexion &amp; strength of the patient, or the fitnesse of the season for ministring, or the proportion of the medicine to the qualitie of the sicknesse, and thereunto ignorant also of the methode for orderly proceeding, or iudiciously to marke or obserue the right prognostica; do daily by their desperate dealings endamage and weaken, if not cast away



such as be so hazarded vnder their charge. Such blind aduēturing without rule or arte to be vsed in the needfull occasions of the Commonweale, who seeth not how hurtfull and pernicious it may proue? and therfore forbearing (as I haue bound my selfe to doe) to inlarge this discourse out of other learning, I will onely serue my turne with stretching of this one comparison thus farre farther: That as the profound and rationall Phisicion is for certaintie of cure,The learned fitter for gouernmēt than the vnlearned. and direction in the regiment of health, to bee chosen and vsed before the rash vnskilfull Empiricke: So the learned and well seene in the principles of politicall doctrine, is fitter to bee imployed and trusted with the publike dispatches and affaires, tending to the preseruation and amendment of the state, than any bold busie bodies that either creepe in at vnwares, or thrust in by shouing and shouldring; their agencies being too daungerous, where the bodie of the Realme must become their patient: For where their skill is all but by tradition, and not attayned by the studie and enquirie after causes and reasons, how be they able in the middest of so manie deceauable differences to find for each particular occurrance,Vnperfect curing. the proper and right requisite application, without the which whatsoeuer is or seemeth remedied, breaketh foorth anew, waxing raw and sore againe. Thenceit commeth, that oftentimes the medicine is worse than the disease, and the Phisicion becommeth the heire vnto his patient; because where wee most repose our selues in a confidence of helpe, there through an vnaduised cariage in the partie trusted (affecting his owne end) and wandering from his right way, wee be most seduced and left succourlesse, exposed to all calamities.



Discretion is the Limbecke that extracteth to his right vse all kind of learning,Discretion in state busines. without it nor the Phisicion in his manyfold varietie of diseases and medicines, nor the Politician in his multiplicitie of causes and cases, can affect any thing, either with certaintie to good, or laudably to reputation. If this be not his best guide, like the threed of Ariadne, to lead him through the laberinth of so many intricat diuersities, how shall hee be able to rule the matter, when hee standeth enwrapped, and euen ouer-matched with the contrarietie of rules?Seueritie. One rule telleth him that Nulla remedia tam sunt salutaria, quam quae faciunt dolorem: The best medicines doe most payne vs: by the imitation whereof the State Phisicion will perhaps trust most to his sharpe and austere remedies. Another rule aduiseth such application as is Secundū naturam, et quod cuiusque natura desiderat. Hereof it cōmeth, that what delighteth and pleaseth (though it be not for goodnes comparable) yet for his familiar agreeablenesse to our stomack and nature, is to be preferred vnto that which is offensiue, vnsauorie, or churlish. This consideration preuaileth in gouernment also,Lenitie. to haue all the businesse of correction and reformation transacted quietly without contrarious conflicting; and by such meanes as may rather giue contentment, than make conquest: because what is loathed or not brooked, may more hurt or molest in recoyling, than auaile by an vnwilling and painfull retention.
            
               Aristotle propoundeth as a Probleame, That the selfe fame inflammations by some be cured with cooling,Contrarie waies to cure the same disease. and by others are ripened and digested by heating. This phisicke hath also bene wisely put in practise



in the tendance of the raging vlcers and impostumations of the bodie politique, when the hote humour of haughtinesse in great men hath sometimes by gentlenesse and counsell bene allayd, and other sometimes by vrging and more heating brought to a rupture &amp; running out. What encumbreth or annoyeth nature, is sometimes at his first gathering (before it getteth an head) dissolued and dispersed,Diuersities in curing, vppon diuers respects and sometimes againe is suffered, yea and forced to shew his vttermost virulence, and to get vnto him his full strength, before it be once medled with. The same medicines that easeth vs of griefe in one part, may annoy vs in another, that help at one time, may hurt at another, or that heale one may dispatch another: Wee vse not the same course in Summer as we doe in Winter, nor the same when the bodie is too full, as when it is brought low, nor the same to children and old folks, as to men of confirmed strength; nor the same in the height or amendment, which wee doe at the beginning of the disease. Such respectiuenesse we may expect from the political Phisicion, that he be not pragmatically tied to the Idem, or Eodem modo, but that from the axiomes &amp; conclusions of learning, he doe so aplie his cogitations to the discrepancie of occasions, as that (being vs
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   qua
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   sapiens) he accomodate his cures rather by certeinty than at aduenture, and euen therein to shew himselfe regular, by varying of his proceedings frō his rules, as the variablenesse of condicions, circumstances, and considerations shall with reason ouerrule him. And he doth oftentimes (as a well skilled phisicion doth) finding any imperfection or vnaptnesse in the first remedies repeale and cast aside them by prouiding and ordeining new.Repealing of some, and making of new lawes.


               
Yet in one point more let vs note the effects of skill in a Phisicion, who is able to make euen poysons medicinable; which sheweth, that when Magistrats shall vppon occasion make vse of wicked men,Magistrats may make vse of the wicked. we should bee so farre from charging them with the obiection of vngodly policie, as that we should rather for such their property &amp; power liken them vnto God, who himselfe infinitly good, extracteth good out of euill.
            Such expert Phisicions of the Realme, doe (like far darting Apollo) spread abroad their golden rayes and happie influence,Good magistrats praised. as well for preseruing of publique health and prosperitie, as also for the subduing of all poysoned Pithons, and miscompounded monsters, that infect the ayre, or defile the land of the Commonweale.
            Some other good requisits in our State-Phisicions may not be pretermitted. It is needfull, that they bee of a graue stayednesse, and free from ficklenesse or flexibilitie. I yeeld, that a Phisicion may by occasions and circumstances bee moued to dispose himselfe to change both his opinion and his practise: yet I hold it requisite that such his change may appeare to proceed rather from deliberation than lightnesse, from iudicious discerning of right causes, rather than from a vayne affectation of new courses; so hee be constant to his propounded end of effecting the saftie &amp; health of the bodie, resting vppon his skill and best endeuour, to make tryall of sundrie different meanes likely, and seruing thereunto, is no vnconstancie at all. The same may bee affirmed of Gouernours: It cannot but bee hatefull and scandalous to any Magistrate, to play the light headed temporizer, by the exchange and oft shifting



of his opinion, still to conforme to euerie accidentall alteration in the State: for howsoeuer it may bee allowed vnto him (vppon preuayling considerations) to change his medicines rather than his mind, retayning stil his integritie and constancie towards the state: yet is it made a note of common obseruance, that such as be either caried about by euerie tempest of the time, or be swayed by their owne leuitie to entertaine diuersities in the order of gouernment; as they do but affect Latebram male fidei, so they giue place and passage to euery stirring &amp; vpstart spirit (as the heedlesnes or giddinesse of the bodies phisicion oft doth) with force &amp; furie to conquer all. I know that a remedilesse necessitie may constrayne the skilfullest Pilot (being beaten from his intended hauen) to take into the next harbor that fortune shall offer, rather than with extreme perill to contend with the storme: Such a kind of compelled alteration no indifferent obseruer will debarre any prouident Polititian of, That whensoeuer he shall varie from his first well grounded resolution, his relinquishing of the former, or his pursuing of any new intention, may be iudged rather necessarie than voluntarie, more reasonable than fashionable, and for the performing of farther good rather than to follow the inclination of his owne vnsteady humours. They must be louing and compassionate,The Phisicions louing of the patient. the proofe and demonstrance wherof maketh their patients comfortably and readily to swallow any their prescribed receits, and it is one step towards cure, when the sick holdeth a good thought of his Phisicion, persuading himselfe, that his labours are vndertaken out of an honest and heartie desire of doing good, rather than to inrich himselfe



by vndeserued gettings. The ouermuch regard of fees or gaynes in some Phisicions,Couetousnesse in getting of fees. maketh good the saying of Philemon an old Poet, O quam male medicus se habet, cum neminem male sese habere contigit,
               Desire of gaine in some lawiers 
               medicus valere amicos ne suos quidem cupit: which (howsoeuer perhaps it may be touchingly applied to some Lawiers also, whose profession is to find phisicke to redresse particular wrongs, and therefore that they may bee set a worke with the case, wisheth their friends sometimes in an ill case) yet farre bee it that any the higher magistrats of iustice and gouernment, should bee shamefully stained with the blacke note of so foule an imputation, as out of the diseases, sores, and corruptions of the people, to enrich and aduaunce his owne estate. And against that sort of Lawyers which shall seeke to make vs such fooles, as by continuall lawing to keepe vs still to that play at foyles, to fill them thereby with fees, let vs learne this phisicall lesson,To be neuer out of law, a great miserie. That as Medice viuere, est misere viuere, so to be neuer out of law, is neuer to know any happie dayes: for as too much phisicke weakeneth and wasteth health; so to be ouerlaid with law, is the vtter losse and confounding of all comforts of life.
            But leauing such purse-purging Lawyers,Magistrats may haue priuat faults, yet good magistrats. I must returne to the pursuite of considerable respects, for the Phisicions of the ciuill bodie. As one may bee a good Phisicion though an euill man; so may he be a good Commonwealths man,Magistrats to be chosen for their skill in gouernment. though otherwise for his priuat faults reproueable. As in chusing a Phisicion, we take not the wealthiest, or that can make best friends, but him that is best skilled, and likeliest to cure: So magistracie and offices of iustice bee not to be bestowed



vppon the richest or most fauoured,Magistrats rather to be natiue than forraine. but vppon the wisest and worthiest. As we like better a Phisicion that is our owne Countreyman, or of some neerenesse in bloud vnto vs, than a forraine borne, or nothing alied vnto vs: so is it well and louingly prouided for, where the Soueraigne (according to such desire) ordereth each people to bee gouerned by their owne natiues. As the Phisicions to encourage and induce their patients to take more cheerefully their prescriptions, doe readily foretast the same themselues: so the Magistrats for the drawing of the people to the more willing obseruance of the lawes,Magistrats must not desist frō their duties for abuses offred vnto them ought to make themselues examples of integritie in the outward shew of a iust conuersation. Besides, as the Phisicion though hee bee oft times by the waiward demeanure of the patient, much abused, yet doeth hee persist in his purpose of performing of the best helpe by any course that his skill affoordeth: So the Magistrat, albeit in the execution of so busy,Magistrats must giue good example. enuious, and troublesome a charge, he must often meet with mischieuous intentions against him, be thwarted with oppositions, and indure indignities, yet must he with a manly and vertuous constancy consecrate his whole endeuours to the resolute following of his necessarie function. Further, as the Phisicion too much set a worke or called vppon, cannot giue to each patient a sufficing attendance: So where there be too many busie imployments cast vppon one magistrat or officer (or too many clyents cloying of one Lawyer) the verie distraction or diuiding of his paines amongst so manie,Magistrats not to haue too many offices or imploiments. applyeth against him the prouerbiall verse: Ad plura intentus minor est ad singula sensus.
            
            
               Lastly, I will bestow vpon our politicall Phisition that complement of qualities, which we vsually look for in a Surgion; that is an Hawks eye, a Ladies hand,Compared to a Surgion in three properties. and a Lions hart: his eye must piercingly spie into all sores and disorders reformable, his hand must not be caried too heauy, but rather tenderly and mercifully; and his hart is to be held vp vndaunted, and vnflexible, when it hath vprightly conceiued of the right, reiecting from him all remisnes, or timorousnes of execution. The Phisition doth not alwaies follow the precisenes of his owne rules,Magistrats do sometimes offend the law themselues. he doth often offend against his owne health, (as others doe) and then is disdainfully mocked with Curate ipsum. I would not aduise any man to be so saucy, as to bid the Magistrat look to his owne faults; but it must be confessed, that such as be seated in places of aucthoritie, may as basely and as badly misgouerne themselues as inferior persons, and thereby not vndeseruedly fitted with that frumpe, That the greater Theefes hang vp the lesser.Magistrats offending, to be punished by other Magistrats. Yet when the Phisition is sick, other Phisitions are prouided to minister vnto him; so the vices of the Magistrats, must vndergo the censure of other Magistrats, to be delt withall as the quallitie thereof requireth. Neuerthelesse, as the Phisitions misdieting of himselfe, is no good pretence for the diseased to refuse to be healed by his endeuour: So the obiection of the Magistrats misbehauiour or reproach must not withdraw our subiection from abyding and yeelding to any his orders or iudgements concerning our emendation.Magistrats faults no pretence to disobey them. It is obserued in the nature of Man, that when he is pressed by sicknesse to pray aide of the Phisition, he holdeth nothing too deare for him, rewarding him



with rich recompence; but when he findeth himselfe recouered, and no more to need him, he will scant afford him any his least fauours; as if he had concluded, that as God created him, so he would honor him, onely for necessities sake. Such also is the fortune of those, who spend their spirits, cares, and industries, in the attendance of the States health;Magistrats deseruings soone forgotten. when it is discerned, that they haue aduised, procured, and ministred the good of the weale publike, then be they extolled by applause, aduanced to honor, and rewarded with bounties; but if the occasion of their meritings be cut off, then forgetting the forepassed helpes, Aesculapius must thence forth loose his sacrifice of Cocks. Nay, their case is somewhat worse, for if that which by them is contriued and intended rightly,Magistrats care and wisdome is iudged of by the euents. faileth of effect, or falleth out sinisterly; then as if the Phisition had either mistaken his cure, or misbehaued himselfe, he maketh a purchase of blame and shame, loosing both the kirnell for which he took paines, and the credit of his art, which notwithstanding he exactly followed. Further than this, he findeth one other greeuance much exceeding the former, which is, That when he hath with his earnest studie and best circumspection decreed and enacted what is to be done,Magistrats discouragement for the want of execution of lawes by them made. his prescriptions will not be receiued, nor his directions followed; without the vse and applying whereof, the making of such receipt was a bootlesse labour. He that will see the right image of that wrong offered to the State-Phisitions, let him but search into his owne hart,Reasons resolue vaine, if there be no will to performe▪
                where when reason hath assembled the Senat of his best vnderstandings, and hath by their discussings resolued what is best to be done, if there then should



want a will to obey and performe such decrees, might not reason and his fellowes as well haue been a sleepe: so verilie when wholsome lawes are deuised and enacted, for the generall benefit of an whole Realme, it is an vntollerable abuse offered to the law-makers, when for lacke of due administration, to concomitate the consulting power, the same shall not haue their execution. Yet were it the shamfullest iniurie of all,Lawes often by cauils illuded. and that no waies standeth with the Patients owne safetie, if the receipts or prescriptions of the Phisition, should be illuded by shifts and cauilled at, of purpose to mistake and peruert the true meaning thereof: So standeth the case with good Statutes, when ill disposed people, will by subtill scanning seek euasions, and alter the sinceritie of them by wrested interpretations. But vertuous Subiects holding obedience to be their essentiall and habituall propertie,Obedience the chiefe vertue of Subiects. and hauing such Phisitions as both zealously loueth them, and are best acquainted with the state of their bodie, will hartily abhor and abandon such miscreant corrupters of the gouerning Iustice.
            It is now time to find some meanes for the obseruing of a meane, lest tediousnes banish delightsomnesse: I haue reserued yet one comparison more, wherwith at the last to close vp all, and to reduce this discourse to my promised period, of the entire embracements betweene Soueraigne and Subiect.The Subiects chiefe care to content the Soueraigne. The bodies hoping after health, or affecting of felicitie, is no other, or to any other end, than to reioice the soule with fulnesse of comfort and satisfiyng pleasures; So let the desires and endeuours of the bodie Politique, and each part thereof, in the acquiring for the State



any supposed or desireable good, bee directed and tend to the making happie of their Soueraigne, by working on all sides his abundant contentation. Then (sith at their first meeting they began with a profession and coniunction of loue) their departure shall not want a recyprocall kindnesse, with the exchange of all mutuall offices of faith and assurednesse. The Princes contentment must be the happinesse of the Subiect, &amp; the subiects welfare the securitie of the Prince: And so shall the Commonwealth be compleatly blessed, by the firmnesse of that concording vnion, hauing Mentem sanam in corpore sano, the tranquillitie of the mind, with indolence of the bodie.
            Thus hauing aduentured to propound vnto publique view (like as Appelles did his picture) this portracture of the bodie Politique, though not so compleatly shaped in all the lyneaments, as may either allure the lookers on to liking, or may suffice to equall the dignitie and maiestie of the matter represented: I must entreat of the wise and expert Polititians, their fauourable interpreting, and encouraging entertainments thereof; vnto whom I haue reason (with all reuerent regard) to dedicate these endeuors; Them hath the coniunction of learning and acting, well entermixed,Politicall gouernors are to be made famous by the prayses of the learned. exactly accomplished; and from the obseruance of their good labours, hath been bred the collection of booke lessons: What they broyling in the heat of affaires, and euen sun-burned with the businesse of the State, doe daily effect for the publique benefit; that we (the contemplators of their merits) in our solitarie priuatnesse at our vnimployed leasures, and from our shadie studies, ought gladly, for the



establishing of their aucthoritie, and for the eternizing of their glorie, to recount &amp; recommend to the vndecaying succession of future times. It was right worthy councell which Demetrius gaue vnto Ptolemie, aduising him diligentlie to reade the bookes written of Politicall gouerment: but his reason is sharpe pointed and toucheth to the verie quick;The benefit which a Soueraigne shall haue by the studying of politicall books. for (saith he) there shall you find that which none dare or will tell you. To say the truth, such works aduisedly &amp; faithfully compiled, be vnpartiall informers, and vncorrupted Councellours, acquainting their readers with the generallitie of right and reason, to be applied to vse in particuler considerations. From thence may all gouernours draw their directions, for the framing and plotting of their most important purposes: and what they thence shall suck will be simple and sincere, without admixture of either deceiptfull drifts, or affectionat inclinations. As in the act or abilitie of right vnderstanding, the soule doth manifest his greatest force and goodnesse:
                  Prouerb. 24. so in the multitude of them that can giue councell, is strength. To such Atlas-like gouernours, that be the supporting Arches of a ciuill State, all politicall learning, and whatsoeuer industrie or discoueries, in that subiect doth properly belong, and ought in them to be treasured vp for store at all times to besteed the State; euen as the light created on the first day, was after transferred into the bodies of the Sun, Moone, and Starres of the firmament, to illighten the whole world.The dedication of Politicall works due to the gouernors of the State. The view of my weaknesse and vnworthinesse, together with the awful respectiuenes wherto I stand bound in all dutie, stayeth me from presumptuous assuming to my selfe of any such clearenesse of



conceipt or iudgement, as may any whit encrease the fulnesse of vnderstanding in our great and superiour lights. Yet if by the propounding of this paire of bodies, so equally matching in fashion and liknesse, ciuill consultations vpon any occurrance may (by such correspondence) receiue helpe, I hope it will not be disliked, that I haue endeuoured to set open for their light a broader and larger passage. I may not make my selfe ignorant, that it is easie to offend in the curiositie of inquiring into State-secrets;Curiositie of looking Into state businesse. there is euen in that kind also a forbidden Apple. And it hath euer been reckoned an audaciousnes not to be digested, to intrude with timeritie, where restraint hath placed a crosse barre. If euery bodie must know all, counsell were no counsell. The bodie politique as the naturall, is whole and close chested, there is not in his brest (no more than in the others) any glasse windowes or casements placed, for medling Momus to look into the reserued occultanda of the heart. Such as haue an itching desire to peere within the curtaine of those vndiscouerable secrets, besides their offensiue and vnmannerly sawcinesse, against the reuerend and sage Senators of the State, do apparantly detect themselues to be but babling and seducing newes tellers. Cato censureth fitly of them percunctatores garruli, and Plautus amplie describeth their natures,
                  In Trinumo.
                terming them by an old but significant name of famigeratores, as filled both in the eares and in the mouth, with a certaine saleable windy matter of rumors and reports.
            There is a sobrietie to be obserued in the gayning of knowledge by inquisitiuenesse;
                  Inquisitiuenes.
                for such as ouerfill themselues, and doe drinke too deepe of harkening



and hearesayes, will likewise incurre the other extremities, both of reeling as disied by vntruthes; and of casting vp againe, by the publishing of all they heare. But when this searching and piercing presumption shall get vp to the highest step, and fall to prie into the Prince himselfe, to make discoueries and dinulgings of his dispositions, intentions, affections, qualities,To prie into the princes dealings or dispositions, how dangerous it is. waightie businesses, and serious actions; then it hath the resemblance, and is a verie spice of the heat of Phaeton, of the lightnesse of Icarus, of the treacherie of Tantalus, of the blabbing of Sisiphus, of the lust of Ixion, of the immodestie of Acteon, and of the slie surreption of Prometheus, and is worthily punishable with some of their tortures. Salomon compareth the vnsearchable heart of the King, to the height of heauen, and the depth of the earth; arguing thereby as well the presumption as the impossibilitie of discouering the same, Pro. 25.
            
            Against this odious iniury of the subiects ouermuch enquiring and spying into their Soueraigne,A caueat from natures work. I haue one arrow or argument left me, to be taken out of the same quiuer: Nature hath so prouided, that no sences of the bodie doeth penetrate into the essence or inwardnesse of the soule; they bee espials for him, not spyers into him: for Animus oculorum effugit obtutum. Then in the same sort, as well for a warning to my selfe, as for a reproofe to any other that way offending, let mee set it downe for a positiue trueth, that euen heerein also our manners and dutie should contemplate and imitate nature, as with a modest reuerence to forbeare to intromit our animaduerting curiositie into the bosome of sacred and vnsearchable Maiestie:



which who so doth with an humbled spirit well vnderstand what it is in his verie altitude and latitude,In soueraignty a great mistery shall certainly find it to be as great an Arcanum in policie, as the soule can bee in nature: So (with all beseeming reseruation of my dutious submission to superiour powers) I doe to the residue of Readers offer a petition of indifferencie, That if they shall light of any thing defectiue or wanting waight, I may bee bold to borrow some few graynes of their good fauour, wherwith perhaps the scales may be held vpright. If they meet with any matter seeming an Vlcer, tender of touch, and subiect to construction; I may onely chalenge them to be charitable, than which (I hope) there will need no other healing. Finally, if to the daintie eare of this all-scanning age, my simple and vnpolished worke shall giue no satisfaction, yet the scope of my honest intentions, and the loyaltie of my well meaning, may at the least acquite me of blame, if not merit acceptation.
