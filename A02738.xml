            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               Baleus prolocutor.
               
                  
                     IN ych commen welthe, most hygh prchemynence,
                  Is due vnto lawes for soch commodyte,
                  As is had by them, For as Cicero geueth sentence
                  Where as is no lawe, can no good order be,
                  In nature, in people, in howse nor yet in citie.
                  The bodyes aboue, are vnderneth a lawe,
                  Who coulde rule the worlde, were it not vndre awe?
                  Lyke as Chrysippus, full clarkely doth dyffyne,
                  Lawe is a teacher, of matters necessary,
                  A knowledge of thynges, both naturall and deuyne
                  Perswadynge all truth. dysswadynge all iniury.
                  A gyfte of the lorde, deuoyde of all obprobry,
                  An wholesom doctryne, of men dyscrete and wyse,
                  A grace from aboue and a very heauenly practyse.
                  Our heauenly maker, mannys lyuynge to dyrect,
                  The lawes of Nature, of Bondage, and of Grace,
                  Sent into thys worlde, with vycyousnesse infect,
                  In all ryghteousnesse, to walke before hys face.
                  But Infydelyte, so worketh in euery place,
                  That vnder the heauens, no thynge is pure &amp; cleane,
                  So moch the people, to hys peruerse wayes leane.
                  The lawe of Nature, hys fylthy dysposycyon.
                  
                     Corrupteth with ydolles, and stynkynge Sodometry.
                  The lawe of Moses, with Auaryce and Ambycyon.
                  He also poluteth. And euer contynually,
                  Christes lawe he defyleth. with cursed hypocresy,
                  And with false doctryne, as wyll apere in presence,
                  To the edyfyenge, of thys Christen audyence.
               
               
                  Of Infydelyte, God royll hymself reuenge.
                  With plages of water, of wylde fyre and of sworde.
                  And of hys people, due homage he wyll chalenge.
                  Euer to be knowne. for their God and good lorde,
                  After that he hath, those lawes agayne restorde,
                  To their first bewtye commyttynge them to fayth.
                  He is now in place, marke therfor what he sayth.

                     In clennes of lyfe, and in a gentyll behauer.
                     Depely instruct hym, our mysteryes to sauer,
                     By the workes of fayth, all vyces to seclude,
                     And preserue in hym, our godly symylytude.

                  Your preceptes are true, &amp; of perpetuall strength
                  On iustyce grounded, as wyll apere at length.

                  Deus Pater.
                  Our lawes are all one, though yow do thre apere
                  Lyke wyse as our wyll, is all one in effect.
                  But bycause that Man, in hymself is not clere
                  To tyme and persone, as now we haue respect,
                  
                     And as thre teachers, to hym we yow dyrect,

                  We consydre that, for as concernynge Man,
                  Foure seuerall tymes, are moch to be respected.
                  Of Innocency first, of hys transgressyon than,
                  Than the longe season, wherin he was afflycted,
                  Fynally the tyme, wherin he was redemed.
                  Of pleasure is the first, the seconde of exyle.

                  To serue yow hys lorde, and with laudes to prosecute
                  Thys lawe was geuen Man, in tyme of innocency,
                  In no wyse to eate, of the forbydden frute.
                  These two lawes broken, both they were destytute,

                  Where yow sayd. Eate not. He sayd vnto the womā,
                  Eate, Ye can not dye, As Godes ye shall be than.
                  By thys first of all, your lawdes Man proued true.
                  And Sathans lawe false, whych he now dayly rue.

                     Man is now mortall and Angell become a deuyll.

                     Whan he hys dronken father scorned.

                     Those are the wayes to hell.

                  The worst fault I haue, I am hastye now and thā,
                  But it is sone gone, I toke it of a woman.
                  But what meane those tables, that ye haue in your hande?
               
               
                  Moseh lex.
                  Kepe sylence a whyle, and thu shalt vnderstande.
                  Thre thynges I declare, the first are the preceptes morall.
                  Next, the lawes iudycial, &amp; last the rytes ceremonyal
                  The morall preceptes, are Gods cōmaundemētes ten.
                  Whych ought euermore, to be obserued of all men.
                  The lawes of Nature, the morall preceptes declare,
                  And ye plesaūt workes, to God they teache &amp; prepare
                  They sturre man to fayth, &amp; prouoke hym also to loue
                  To obeye, to sorne, and to worshypp God aboue.
                  In two stonye tables, God wrote them first of all,
                  That they shuld remayne, as thynges contynuall.
                  The first hath but thre, whych tēde to Gods hygh honour,
                  Geuē hath the seconde, &amp; they concerne our neybour.
                  The first doth expounde, the first lawe naturall.
                  The next the other, makynge them very formall.
                  In sprete is the first, yt we shuld God honour &amp; loue.
                  To outward workynge, the seconde doth vs moue.
                  
                     Forbyddynge all wrōges, preseruynge iust marryage,
                  Norryshynge true peace, and other godly vsage.

                  What is the effect, of your lawes Iudycyall?

                  Soch thynges to cōmaunde, as are cyuyle or tēporall.
                  
                     From vyce to refrayne, and outwarde iniurye,
                     Quyet to conserue, and publyque honestie.
                     These are to support, the lawes of the seconde table.
                     Ceremonyall rytes are also commendable,
                     In holy dayes, garmētes, temples &amp; consecracyons,
                     Sacryfyces &amp; vowes, with offerynges &amp; expiacyōs
                  
                  
                     Whych are vnto Christ, as fygurs, types &amp; shadowes
                     As Paule doth declare, in hys pystle to the Hebrues.
                     These are only fygures, &amp; outwarde testymonyes,
                     No man is perfyght, by soch darke ceremonyes.
                     Only perteyne they, vnto the thirde cōmaundement,

                     We must poyson them, with wyll workes &amp; good intentes.
                     Where as God doth saye, No siraunge goddes thu shalt haue,
                     With Sayntes worshyppynge, that clause we wyll depraue.

                     For a good intent yet wyll we haue pylgrymage.
                     Though he wyll vs not, to take hys name in vayne,
                     With tradycyons yet, therunto wyll we constrayne.
                  
                  
                     No Sabboth wyl we, with Gods worde sanctyfye,
                     But with lyppe labour, and ydle ceremonye.
                     To father and mother, we maye owe non obedyence,
                     Our relygyon is, of so great excellence.
                     Though we do not slee, yet maye we heretykes burne,
                     If they wyll not sone, from holy scripture turne.
                     What though it be sayd. Thu shalt do no fornycacyō,

                     God hath inhybyted, to geue false testymonye,

                     Of mē make we swyne, by the draffe of our tradycyōs
                     And cause thē nothynge, to regard but superstycyōs.
                     As dogges vnresonable, on most vyle carren fede,
                     So wyll we cause them, seke ydolles in their nede.
                  
                  And alwayes their groūde, shall be, for a good intēt.

                  To the corruptynge. of the lawe of Moyses,

                     The lawes Iudycyall. through cawtels and delayes.
                     I wyll also drowne, to all ryghteouse mēnys decayes
                     To set thys forwarde, we must haue sophystrye,
                     Phylosophye and Logyck, as scyence necessarye.
                     The byshoppes must holde, their prestes in ignoraūce
                     
                        With longe latyne houres, least knowledge to them chaunce.
                     Lete them haue lōge mattens, lōge euē songes &amp; lōge Masses.
                     And that wyll make them, as dull as euer were asses.
                     That they shall neuer, be able to prophecye,
                     Or yet preach the truth, to our great iniurye.
                  
                  
                     Lete the cloysterers, be brought vp euer in sylence,
                     Without the scriptures, in payne of dysobedyēce.
                     Se the laye people, praye neuer but in latyne,
                     Lete them haue their Crede, and seruyce all in latyne
                     That, a latyne beleue, maye make a latyne sowle,

                     If they haue Englysh, lete it be for aduaūtage,
                     For pardons, for Syrges, for offerynges and pylgrymage.
                     I recken to make them, a newe Crede in a whyle,
                     And all in Englysh, their conscyēce to begyle.

                     Two enemyes with me, haue played most wycked partes.
                     And left me starke blynde, God knoweth to my sore greuaunce,
                     And I thynke also, to your more hynderaunce.
                     To leade yow to Christ somtyme, a gyde I was.
                     Now am I so blynde, I can not do it, Alas.

                     Ded fall vpon me, and spoyle me of my syght.
                     One was Ambycyon, whych euer ought me hate,
                     And Couetousnesse, the other enemye hyght.
                     Now forsoth and God, in their most cruell spyght.
                     The one made me blynde, the other made me lame,
                     And whā they had done, ther at they had great game

                     With scepture and swerde, all vyces to correct.
                     Let not Ambycyon, nor Couetousnesse deuoure,
                     Your faythfull subiectes, nor your offycers infect.
                     Haue to your clergye, a dylygent respect
                     And se they do not▪ corrupt the lawes of God,
                     For that doth requyre, a terryble heauye rod.

                     That I of hardenesse, a lawe shuld specyfye,

                     With clerenesse of syght, &amp; other pleasures manye.
                     Now wyll I to Christ, that he maye me restore,
                     To more perfeccyon, than euer I had afore.

                     For marryage of prestys, thre chyldren had that yeare.
                     By thys maye ye se that sūtyme we make mery cheare.

                  Marry that ye do, I shall beare ye recorde now.
                  But how wyll ye answere, for breakynge of your vow?
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  We neuer breake vowe, so longe as we do not marrye,
                  Though we in whoredome, be neuer so bolde &amp; busye.
               
               
                  Infidelitas,
                  By your order than, ye maye walke moch at large.
                  What hast thu hypocresye? to laye for thy dyscharge.

                     Saynt Frāces habyte, with the holy gyrdle &amp; whode,
                     Non can go to helle, that therin dye by the rode,
                     In case saynt Frances, be sure vpon their syde,
                     Els maye they fortune, to be of their purpose wyde.
                     For I reade of one, that shuld haue gone to the deuyll
                     But the spretes of helle, coulde do to hym non euyll.
                  
                  
                     Tyll saynt Frances came, &amp; toke frō hym hys cowle,
                     Then went he to helle, the fryres ded heare hym howle.
                     I wyll therfor serue, S. Frances with hart &amp; mynde
                     With dayly memoryes, that he maye be my frynde.
                     And than I care not, for all the deuyls in hell,
                     That I haue tolde yow, is more true than the Gospel.
                  
               
               
                  Infidelitas,
                  Then are ye more sure, thā monkes for your heretage,
                  For their landes are here, but ye clayme heauen for aduauntage.

                  Yet is it to them a very plesaunt thynge,
                  Their abbot at home, to be called lorde and kynge.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Naye, monke and chorle, for here is no kynge butone.
                  If he be a kynge. hys mace is a mary bone,
                  Any hys crowne a cow torde. Soch knaues as come from the carr,
                  Must be called kynges, for playenge a popysh part,
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  It become not the, the Romyshe pope so to lurche.
                  
                     Consyderynge he is, the hyghest of the churche.

                  If he be the hyghest, than is he the wether cocke,
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Ah, now I perceyue, thu art dysposed to mocke,
                  Of all holy churche, he is the pryncypall heade.
               
               
                  Infidelitas:
                  Marry that is true, he sendeth out bulles vndre lead
                  And he hath two keyes, the one to open hell,
                  The other speareth heauen, thus do newe heretykes tel
                  They report also, that dogges haue no deuocyō,
                  To hys holy lawes, not to hys olde instruccyon.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Why shuld dogges hate hym? make that more euydent.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  They loue no pese porrege, nor yet reade hearynges in lent,
                  Stock fysh nor oysters, but curse hym body and bone,
                  And wolde hys reade sprottes, &amp; rottēfysh were gone
                  Tush, I heare them I, and that maketh me full sad.

                  I heare the people, complayne very moch of the.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  What is their pratlinge, I praye the hartely tell me.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  They saye, thu teachest, nothyng but lowsy tradyciōs
                  
                     And lyes for lucre, with damnable superstycyons.
                  And thus they cōclude, yt the draffe of popysh prystes
                  Is good ynough for swyne, by whom they meane the papystes.
                  Yea, and they saye also, the dyet of men is all.
                  To most vyle carren, the dogges wyll sonest fall.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Than do they compare, the papystes vnto dogges.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Marry that they do, &amp; to soch swynysh hogges.
                  As in swyll &amp; soffe, are brought vp all their lyfe.
                  Soch are the papystes, they saye both man and wyfe.
                  They saye of the also, that thu art a noughty knaue,
                  By prowlynge and lyenge, ye fryers wolde all haue.
                  Thyne order they saye, is spronge euen out of hell,
                  And all thys knowledge, they haue now of the Gospell.

                  Why, where is he now, I besych the hartely tell,
               
               
                  Infidelitas
                  By the messe abroade, &amp; I warāde ye maketh reuell.
                  I commoned with hym, and he ded vs despyse,
                  Agaynst hym therfor, sumwhat must we deuyse.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Marry that must we, or els it wyll be wronge,
                  He wyll sure destroye vs, if we do suffer hym longe.
                  Nedes must we serue hym, as we ones serued Christ.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Why mad brayned whoresōs, how ded ye hādle Christ?
               
               
                  
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  
                     As he preached here, we followed frō place to place,
                     To trappe hym in snare, and hys doctryne to deface.
                     Than founde we the meanes, to put hym so to death,
                     Least he agaynst vs, shuld open any more breath.
                     And we set foure knyghtes, to kepe hym downe in hys graue.
                     That he neuer more, our lyuynge shuld depraue.
                  
                  
                     And thus must we serue, the Gospell, no remedye,
                     Els wyll be destroye, our lyuynge perpetuallye.
                     Better one were loft, than we shuld perysh all,
                     As Cayphas ones sayd, in counsell pharysaycall.
                  
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  By God &amp; wele sayd. Whā ye haue hym thys graue,
                  Stāpe hym downe tyll he shyte. &amp; serue hym lyke a knaue.
               
               
                  Hypocrysis.
                  We must so ordre hym, that he go no more at large.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Foure knyghtes wyll we hyre, whō we shall streyghtly charge,
                  To kepe hym downe harde. The first are ambycyouse prelates,
                  Then couetouse lawers, that Gods worde spyghtfully hates,
                  Lordes without lernynge, &amp; iustyces vnryghtfull,
                  These wyll kepe hym downe, and rappe hym on the scull.
                  
                     Ther someners &amp; ther scribes, I warāde ye shal stere
                  With balyues and catch polles, to holde hym downe euery where.
                  I trowe Rugge &amp; Corbet, At Norwych wyll do their part.
                  With wharton of Bongaye, and for my sake put hym to smart.
               
               
                  Hypocrysis.
                  And I wyll rayse vp, in the vnyuersytees,
                  The seuen slepers there, to aduaūce the popes decrees
                  As Dorbel &amp; Duns, Durande &amp; Thomas of Aquyne

                  In hys hande thre crosses, &amp; iij, crownes on hys head here.
                  Hys power betokenynge, in heauē, in earth, &amp; in hell
                  That he maye commaunde, all kynges to subdue the Gospell.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  
                     Hys selfe maye do that, he nede cōmaunde nō other.
                     Is not he the head, of the holy church our mother?
                     Maye not he make sayntes, and deuyls at hys owne pleasure?
                     Whych hath in hys hādes, the keyes &amp; churches treasure?
                     So wele as he made, S. Hermā first a saynt,

                        First he sent hym to heauen, by hys canonyzacyon,
                     And from thens to helle, by an excommunycacyon,
                     We reade of Formosus, that after he was dead,
                     One pope hys fyngars, an other cut of hys head.
                     And threwe hys carkas, into the floude of Tyber,
                     With the head &amp; fyngars, as Platina doth remēber.
                  
                  
                     In token that he, is iudge ouer quyck and dead,

                  Vindicta Dei.
                  Thynkest thu to stoppe me, with thy folysh cōiuracyon
                  Whom God sendeth hyther, for thy abhomynacyon?
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  What art thu called? thy name to me rehearce.
               
               
                  Vindicta Dei.
                  I am vindicta Dei, in pōnyshment most fearce,
                  With water, with swerde, and with fyre I must the pearce.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Be good in thy offyce, and thu shalt haue moneye and meate.
               
               
                  Vindicta Dei.

                        But that I wyll do, as God hath me commaunded.
                     For if worldly gyftes, my furye myght haue changed.
                     The vnyuersall worlde, had not bene drowned with water,
                     Nor Sodome and Gomor, with so fyery fearfull matter.
                     Nor yet the Israelytes, with terrour of the sworde,
                     With hungre and pestylence, in the anger of Gods worde.
                  
                  
                     Pharao in Egipte, the plages had neuer felte,
                     Myght I haue bene stopped, for syluer or for gelte.
                     Into Egipte I brought, ten terryble pōnyshmentes
                     Vpon the people for breakynge hys commaūdemētes
                     Their wholsom waters, I tourned into bloude,
                     I multyplyed frogges, to poysō therwith their fonde
                  
                  
                     I made waspes &amp; dranes, them greuously to stynge,
                     And all kyndes of flyes, sone after ded I in brynge
                     Vpon their cattel, I threwe the foule pestylence,
                     Both borche, byle &amp; blayne, they had for their offence.
                     Lyghtenynges and haylynges, destroyed their corne and frute,
                     A swarne of hungry locustes, their pastours destytute
                  
                  
                     The space of thre dayes, I gaue them palpable darkenesse,
                     
                        I slewe the first gootē, of mā

                  Vindicta Dei.
                  What, thu wylt not so, thy braynes are not so lyght.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Anger me not to moch, for if thu do, I fyght.
               
               
                  Vindicta Dei.
                  All that wyll not helpe, thy wycked workynges now,
                  Whan the stronger come, the weaker must nedes bowe
                  The lawe of Nature, infected thu hast with a leprye?
               
               
                  Infidelitas,
                  Naye, it was not I, but that wytche Idolatrye,
                  And that polde shorne knaue, that men call Sodomye
               
               
                  Vindicta Dei.
                  Of whom spronge they first? but of Infydelyte?
                  Therfor thu shalt haue that plage of penalte,
                  Whych they first tasted, for their inyquyre.
                  For those two vyces, I drowned the worlde with water.
                  In token wherof, I plage the with the same matter.
               
               hic Infidelitatem lympha percutit.

                  Tush, I defye thy worst. Thys shall not dryue me hēce
                  For after the floude, with Cham had I resydence.
                  And so contynued, tyll Moyses lawe came in.
                  With hys iolye tryckes, a newe rule to begyn.

                     And hym thu corruptedest, with Auaryce &amp; Ambycyō,
                     And so dedyst leaue hym, in myserable cōdycyō,
                     Thu shalt haue therfor, that than to them was due,
                     Most terryble barrayle, the Israelytes vntrue,
                     That tyme ded suffer, for their infydelyte,
                     Wherfor with thys swerde, I iustlye bannysh the.
                  
                  Bycause thu shalt here, geue place to Christes gospel

                     Whan Christ preached here, &amp; taught them in vext hym sore?
                     Yes, &amp; after that, was I with Simon Magus.
                     With Saunder Copper smyth, with Elimas and Demetrius.
                     And now I perseuer, amōge ye rāke rable of papystes
                     Teachyng ther shorlynges, to playe the Antichrystes.

                     The innocent bloude, of sayntes contynuallye,
                     Doth call vnto God, to reuenge their iniurye,
                     Agaynst false doctryne, and cursed hypocresye.
                     Whom thu hast raysed, the glory of the Gospell,
                     To darken, and hys fryndes, most myserably to quell.
