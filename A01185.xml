            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

of Rheine, and chiefe
Electresse of the

               Madam,
            
            
               AMong many the
worthie Chancellors
of this famous Isle,
there is obserued in
Sir THOMAS MORE, and Sir
FRANCIS BACON an admirable
sympathy of wit and humour:
witnesse those graue monuments
of inuention &amp; learning,
wherewith the world is so
plentifully enricht by them
both. I will instance onely in

the conceaued Vtopia of the
one, and the reuealed Sapientia
Veterum of the other: Whereof
the first (vnder a meere Idea of
perfect State gouerment) containes
an exact discouerie of the
vanities and disorders of reall
Countries: And the second (out
of the foulds of Poeticall fables)
laies open those deepe Philosophicall
mysteries, which had
beene so long lockt vp in the
Casket of Antiquity; so that it
is hard to iudge to whether of
these two worthies, Policy and
Morality is more behoulding.
I make no question therefore
but this obseruation (touching
the parallel of their spirits) shal
passe so currant to succeeding
ages, that it will be said of thē as
in former times pronounced of
Xenophon &amp; Plato, Fuere aequales.
            
            
               
And for this Booke that
humbly present to your Highnes,
which so eminently expresseth
its owne perfection, in
me it would seeme no lesse a vanity
to giue it attributes of
glory and praise, then if I should
lend Spectacles to Lynx, or an
Eye to Argus, knowing it
needles to wast guilding on
pure Gould, which is euer best
valued by its owne true touch
&amp; luster. But to descend to my
selfe, that doe now lay before
your Princely cēsure the Translation
of these excellent and iudicious
discourses, so barely
wrapt vp in my harsh English
phrase, that were by the Author
so richly attired in a sweet Latine
stile: I must therein flie to
the Sanctuary of your gracious
acceptance. In which hope securing

my doubts, doe with
all reuerence kisse your Princely
hands: Remaining
euer readie to approue

            THE PREFACE.
            
               THE Antiquities of the
first age (except those
we find in sacred Writ)
were buried in obliuion
and silence: silence was succeeded
by Poeticall fables; and Fables againe
were followed by the Records
we now enioy. So that the mysteries
and secrets of Antiquity were
distinguished and separated from
the Records and Euidences of succeeding
times, by the vaile of fiction
which interposed it selfe and
came betweene those things
which perished, and those things
which perished, and those which
are extant. I suppose some are of opinion,
that my purpose is to write
toyes and trifles, and to vsurpe the
same liberty in applying, that the
Poets assumed in faining, which I
might doe (I confesse) if I listed,

and with more serious contemplations
intermixe these things, to
delight either my selfe in meditation,
or others in reading. Neither
am I ignorant how fickle and inconstant
a thing fiction is, as being
subiect to be drawen and wrested
any way, and how great the commoditie
of wit and discourse is, that
is able to apply things well, yet so
as neuer meant by the first Authors.
But I remember that this
liberty hath beene lately much abused;
in that many to purchase the
reuerence of Antiquitie to their
owne inuentions and fancies, haue
for the same intent laboured to
wrest many poeticall Fables. Neither
hath this old and common vanity
bene vsed onely of late or now
and then: for euen Crisippus long
agoe did (as an Interpreter of
dreames) ascribe the opinions of the

Stoikes to the ancient Poets; and
more sottishly doe the Chymicks
appropriate the fancies &amp; delights
of Poets in the transformations of
bodies, to the experiments of their
furnace. All these things (I say)
I haue sufficiently considered and
weighed, and in them haue seene
and noted the generall leuity and
indulgence of mens wits about Allegories.
And yet for all this I relinquish
not my opinion. For first
it may not be, that the folly and
loosenesse of a few should altogither
detract from the respect due
to the Parables: for that were a
conceit which might sauour of prophanenesse
and presumption: for
Religion it selfe doth somtimes delight
in such vailes and shadowes:
so that who so exempts them,
seemes in a manner to interdict all
commerce betweene things diuine

and humane. But concerning humane
wisedome, I doe indeed ingenuously
and freely confesse, that
I am enclined to imagine, that vnder
some of the ancient fictions lay
couched certaine mysteries and Allegories,
euen from their first inuention.
And I am perswaded
(whether rauished with the reuerence
of Antiquity, or because in
some Fables I finde such singular
proportion betweene the similitude
and the thing signified; and such
apt and cleare coherence in the very
structure of them, and propriety
of names wherewith the persons or
actors in them are inscribed and
intitled) that no man can constantly
deny, but this sense was in the
Authours intent and meaning
when they first inuented them, and
that they purposely shadowed it in
this sort: For who can be so stupid &amp;

blind in the open light, as (when he
heares how Fame, after the Gyants
were destroyed, sprang vp as their
yongest Sister) not to refer it to the
murmers and seditious reports of
both sides, which are wont to fly abroad
for a time after the suppressing
of insurrections? Or when he
heares how the Gyant Typhon
hauing cut out and brought away
Iupiters nerues, which Mercurie
stole from him, and restored againe
to Iupiter; doth not presently perceiue
how fitly it may be applyed to
powerfull rebellions, which take
from Princes their sinewes of money
and authority, but so, that by
affability of speech, and wise edicts
(the minds of their subiects being
in time priuily, and as it were by
stealth reconciled) they recouer
their strength againe? Or when
he heares how (in that memorable

expedition of the Gods against the
Gyants) the braying of Silenus his
Asse, conduced much to the profligation
of the Gyants; doth not confidently
imagine, that it was inuented
to shew, how the greatest
enterprises of Rebels are oftentimes
dispersed with vaine rumors
and feares?
            Moreouer, to what iudgement
can the conformitie and signification
of Names seeme obscure?
Seeing Metis the wife of Iupiter
doth plainely signifie councell: Typhon,
insurrection; Pan, vniuersality;
Nemesis, reuenge, and the
like. Neither let it trouble any
man, if sometimes hee meete with
Historicall narrations, or additions
for ornaments sake, or confusion
of times, or something transferred
from one fable to another, to
bring in a new Allegory: for it

could be no otherwise, seeing they
were the inuentions of men, which
liued in diuers ages, and had also
diuers ends: some being auncient,
others neotericall: some hauing an
eye to things naturall, others to
morall.
            There is another Argument (and
that no small one neither) to prooue
that these Fables containe certaine
hidden and inuolued meanings,
seeing some of them are obserued
to be so absurd and foolish in the
very relation, that they shew, and
as it were proclaime a parable afar
off: for such tales as are probable,
they may seeme to be inuented for
delight, and in imitation of History.
And as for such as no man
would so much as imagin or relate,
they seem to be sought out for other
ends: For what kinde of fiction is
that, wherein Iupiter is said to

haue taken Metis to wife, and, perceiuing
that she was with child, to
haue deuoured her, whence himselfe
conceiuing, brought forth
Pallas armed out of his head? Truly
I thinke there was neuer dreame
(so different to the course of cogitation,
and so full of monstrosity) euer
hatcht in the braine of man. Aboue
all things this preuailes most with
me, and is of singular moment, that
many of these Fables seeme not to
be inuented of those by whom they
are related and celebrated, as by
Homer, Hesiod, and others: for
if it were so, that they tooke beginning
in that age, and from those
Authours by whom they are deliuered
and brought to our hands;
My mind giues me there could be
no great or high matter expected,
or supposed to proceed from them in
respect of these originals. But if

with attention we consider the
matter, it will appeare that they
were deliuered and related as
things formerly beleeued and receiued,
and not as newly inuented
and offered vnto vs. Besides, seeing
they are diuersly related by
Writers that liued neere about one
and the selfe same time, we may easily
perceiue that they were common
things, deriued from precedent
memorials: and that they became
various by reason of the diuers
ornaments bestowed on them
by particular relations. And the
consideration of this must needs encrease
in vs a great opinion of
them, as not to be accounted either
the effects of the times or inuentions
of the Poets, but as sacred reliques
or abstracted ayres of better
times, which by tradition from
more ancient Nations fell into the

Trumpets and Flutes of the Graecians.
But if any doe obstinately contend,
that Allegories are alwaies
aduentitially, &amp; as it were by constraint,
neuer naturally and properly
included in Fables, we will not
be much troublesome, but suffer
them to enioy that grauity of iudgment
which I am sure they affect,
although indeed it be but lumpish
and almost leaden. And (if they
be worthy to be taken notice of)
we will begin afresh with them in
some other fashion.
            There is found among men (and
it goes for currant) a two-fold vse
of Parables, and those (which is
more to be admired) referred to
contrary ends; conducing as well
to the foulding vp and keeping of
things vnder a vaile, as to the inlightning
and laying open of obscurities.
But omitting the former

(rather then to vndergoe wrangling,
and assuming ancient Fables
as things vagrant and composed
onely for delight) the latter
must questionlesse still remaine, as
not to be wrested frō vs by any violence
of wit, neither can any (that
is but meanely learned) hinder, but
it must absolutely be receiued, as a
thing graue and sober, free from
all vanitie, and exceeding profitable
and necessary to all sciences.
This is it (I say) that leads the vnderstanding
of man by an easie and
gentle passage through all nouell
and abstruse inuentions, which
any way differ from common receiued
opinions. Therefore in the first
ages (when many humane inuentions
and conclusions, which are
now common and vulgar, were
new and not generally knowen) all
things were full of Fables, aenigmaes,

parables, and similies of all
sortes: by which they sought to
teach and lay open, not to hide and
conceale knowledge, especially, seeing
the vnderstandings of men
were in those times rude and impatient,
and almost incapable of any
subtilties, such things onely
excepted, as were the obiects of
sense: for as Hieroglyphicks preceded
letters, so parables were more
ancient then Arguments. And
in these daies also, he that would
illuminate mens minds anew in any
old matter, and that not with
disprofit and harshnesse, must absolutely
take the same course, and
vse the help of similies. Wherefore
all that hath beene said, wee will
thus conclude: The Wisedome of
the Ancients, it was either much
or happy; Much if these figures
and tropes were inuented by studie

and premeditation. Happy if they
(intending nothing lesse) gaue
matter and occasion to so many
worthy Meditations. As concerning
my labours (if there bee any
thing in them which may do good)
I will on neither part count them
ill bestowed, my purpose being to
illustrate either Antiquity, or
things themselues. Neither am I
ignorant that this very subiect
hath beene attempted by others:
But to speake as I thinke, and that
freely without ostentation, the dignitie
and efficacy of the thing is almost
lost by these mens writings,
though voluminous and full of
paines, whilst not diuing into the
depth of matters, but skilfull onely
in certaine common places, haue
applyed the sense of these Parables
to certaine vulgar and generall
things, not so much as glancing at

their true vertue, genuine proprietie,
and full depth. I (if I be
not deceiued) shall be new in common

such as are plaine and open, I will
ayme at further and richer matters.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            THE WISEDOME OF THE ANCIENTS.
            
               1
               CASSANDRA,
or Diuination.
               
                  THe Poets fable that Apollo
being enamored of
Cassandra, was by her
many shifts &amp; cunning
sleights still deluded in his desire;
but yet fed on with hope vntill such
time as shee had drawen from him
the gift of prophesying; and hauing
by such her dissimulation in the
end, atteined to that which from the
beginning shee sought after, at last
flatly reiected his suite. Who finding
himselfe so farre engaged in his promise,
as that hee could not by any

meanes reuoke againe his rash gift,
and yet enflamed with an earnest desire
of reuenge, highly disdayning
to bee made the scorne of a craftie
wench, annexed a penaltie to his
promise, to wit, that shee should
euer foretell the trueth, but neuer be
beleeued: So were her diuinations
alwayes faithfull, but at no time regarded,
whereof shee still found the
experience, yea euen in the ruine of
her owne countrey, which shee had
often forewarned them of, but they
neither gaue credite nor eare to her
words. This Fable seemes to intimate
the vnprofitable liberty of vntimely
admonitions and counselles.
For they that are so ouerweened
with the sharpnesse and dexteritie of
their owne wit and capacitie, as that
they disdaine to submit themselues
to the documents of Apollo, the God
of Harmonie, whereby to learne
and obserue the method and measure
of affaires, the grace and grauitie
of discourse, the differences between
the more iudicious and more vulgar

eares, and the due times when to
speake and when to be silent; Bee
they neuer so sensible and pregnant,
and their iudgements neuer so profound
and profitable, yet in all their
endeuours either of perswasion or
perforce, they auaile nothing, neither
are they of any moment to aduantage
or mannage matters, but do
rather hastē on the ruine of all those
that they adhere or devote themselues
vnto. And then at last when
calamitie hath made men feele the
euent of neglect, then shall they too
late be reuerenced as deep foreseing
and faithfull prophets. Whereof a
notable instance is eminently set
forth in Marcus CatoVticēsis, who as
from a watchtower discouered afar
off, and as an Oracle long foretold,
the approching ruine of his Countrey,
and the plotted tyrannie houering
ouer the State, both in the first
conspiracie, and as it was prosecuted
in the ciuill contention between
Cesar and Pompey, and did no good
the while, but rather harmed the

commonwealth, and hastned on his
countreys bane, which M. Cicero
wisely obserued, and writing to a familiar
friēd doth in these termes excellently
describe, Cato optimè sentit,
sed nocet interdum Reipublicae: loquitur
enim tanquam in Republicâ Platonis,
non tanquam in faece Romuli. Cato
(saith he) iudgeth profoundly, but
in the meane time damnifies the
State, for he speakes as in the commonwealth
of Plato, and not as in
the dregs of Romulus.
               
            
            
               2
               TYPHON, or a Rebell.
               
                  IVno being vexed (say the Poets)
that Iupiter had begotten Pallas
by himselfe without her, earnestly
pressed all the other Gods and Goddesses
that shee might also bring
forth of herselfe alone without him;
and hauing by violence and importunitie
obteyned a graunt thereof,
shee smote the earth, and forthwith
sprang vp Typhon a huge and horrid

monster: This strange birth shee
committes to a Serpent (as a Foster
father) to nourish it, who no sooner
came to ripenes of yeeres, but hee
prouokes Iupiter to battell. In the
conflict the Gyant getting the vpper
hand, takes Iupiter vppon his
shoulders, caries him into a remote
and obscure countrey, and (cutting
out the sinewes of his hands and
feet) brought them away, and so
left him miserably mangled and
maymed. But Mercury recouering
these nerues from Typhon by stealth,
restored them againe to Iupiter. Iupiter
being againe by this meanes corroborated,
assaultes the Monster afresh,
and at the first strikes him with
a thunderboult, from whose bloud
serpents were ingendred. This Monster
at length fainting and flying,
Iupiter casts on him the mount Aetna,
and with the weight thereof
crusht him.
               This Fable seemes to point at the
variable fortune of Princes, and the
rebellious insurrection of Traytors

in a State. For Princes may well be
said to be maried to their dominions,
as Iupiter was to Iuno: but it
happēs now &amp; then, that being deboshed
by the long custome of empyring
&amp; bending towards tyrāny,
they endeuour to draw all to themselues,
and (contemning the counsell
of their Nobles and Senatours)
hatch lawes in their owne braine,
that is, dispose of things by their
owne fancie and absolute power.
The people (repyning at this) study
how to create and set vp a cheefe
of their owne choise. This proiect
by the secret instigation of the Peeres
and Nobles, doth for the most part
take his beginning; by whose conniuence
the Commons being set on
edge, there followes a kind of murmuring
or discontent in the State,
shadowed by the infancie of Typhon,
which being nurst by the naturall
prauitie and clownish malignity of
the vulgar sort (vnto Princes as infestious
as Serpents) is againe repaired
by renewed strength, and at last

breakes out into open Rebellion,
which (because it brings infinite
mischiefs vpon Prince and people)
is represented by the monstrous deformity
of Typhon: his hundred
heads signifie their deuided powers;
his fiery mouthes their inflamed intents;
his serpentine circles their pestilent
malice in besieging; his yron
hands, their merciles slaughters;
his Eagles tallents, their greedy rapynes;
his plumed body, their continuall
rumors, and scouts, &amp; feares
and such like. And sometimes these
rebellions grow so potent that Princes
are inforc't (transported as it
were by the Rebels, and forsaking
the chiefe Seates and Cities of the
Kingdome) to contract their power,
and (being depriued of the Sinewes
of money &amp; maiestie) betake
thēselues to some remote &amp; obscure
corner within their dominions: but
in processe of time (if they beare
their misfortunes with moderation)
they may recouer their strength by
the vertue and industry of Mercury,
                  
that is, they may (by becomming
affable &amp; by reconcyling the minds
and willes of their Subiects with
graue edicts &amp; gratious speech.) excite
an alacritie to graunt ayds and
subsidies whereby to strengthen
their authority anew. Neuertheles
hauing learned to be wise and warie,
they will refraine to try the chaunce
of Fortune by warre, and yet studdy
how to suppresse the reputation of
the Rebels by some famous action,
which if it fall out answerable to
their expectation, the Rebels finding
themselues weakned, and fearing
the successe of their broken
proiects; betake themselues to some
sleight and vaine brauadoes, like the
hissing of serpents, and at length in
despaire betake themselues to flight,
and then when they beginne to
breake, it is safe and timely for kings
to pursue and oppresse them with
the forces and weight of the kingdome,
as it were with the mountaine
Aetna.
               
            
            
               
               3
               The Cyclopes, or the Ministers
of Terror.
               
                  THey say that the Cyclopes (for
their fiercenes &amp; crueltie) were
by Iupiter cast into hell, and there
doomed to perpetuall imprisonment:
but Tellus perswaded Iupiter
that it would doe well, if being set at
liberty, they were put to forge thunderboults,
which being done accordingly,
they became so painefull
and industrious, as that day and
night they continued hammering
out in laborious diligence thunderboults
and other instruments of terrour.
In processe of time Iupiter hauing
conceiued a displeasure against
Aesculapius the sonne of Apollo
for restoring a dead man to life
by physicke; and concealing
his dislike (because there was no
iust cause of anger, the deed being
pious and famous) secretly incens't
the Cyclopes against him, who

without delay slew him with a thunderboult:
In reuenge of which act;
Apollo (Iupiter not prohibiting it)
shotte them to death with his arrowes.
               This Fable may be applyed to the
proiects of Kings, who hauing cruell,
bloudy, &amp; exacting Officers, do
first punish and displace them, afterwards
by the counsell of Tellus, that
is of some base and ignoble person,
and by the preuayling respect of
profite they admit them into their
places againe, that they may haue
instruments in a readynes, if at any
time there should need either seuerity
of execution, or acerbity of exaction.
These seruile creatures being
by nature cruell, and by their former
fortune exasperated, and perceiuing
well what is expected at their hands,
doe shew themselues wonderfull officious
in such kinde of imployments
but being too rash and precipitate
in seeking countenance and
creeping into fauour, doe somtimes
take occasion from the secret becknings

and ambiguous commandes
of their Prince to performe some
hatefull execution. But Princes (abhorring
the fact, and knowing well
that they shall neuer want such kind
of instruments) doe vtterly forsake
them, turning them ouer to the
friends &amp; allyes of the wronged to
their accusations and reuenge, and
to the generall hatred of the people,
so that with great applause and prosperous
wishes and exclamations towards
the Prince, they are brought,
rather too late then vndeseruedly,
to a miserable end.
            
            
               4
               NARCISSVS, or Selfe-loue.
               THey say that Narcissus was exceeding
faire and beautifull
but wonderfull proud and disdainfull;
wherefore dispising all others
in respect of himselfe, hee leades a
solitary life in the woods and chases
with a few followers, to whom hee
alone was all in all, among the rest there

aboue like a man, below like a beast,
his feet like Goates hoofes, bearing
these ensignes of his iurisdiction; to
wit, in his left hand a Pipe of seauen
reeds, and in his right a sheephooke,
or a staffe crooked at the
vpper end, and his mantle made of
a Leopards skinne. His dignities
and offices were these: hee was the
God of Hunters, of Shepheards, and
of all rurall inhabitants: cheefe president
also of hils and mountaines,
&amp; next to Mercury the Embassadour
of the Gods. Moreouer hee was accounted
the leader and comaunder
of the Nymphes, which were alwaies
wont to dance the rounds and friske
about him, hee was acosted by the
Satyres and the olde Sileni. Hee
had power also to strike men with
terrors, and those especially vaine
&amp; superstitious, which are tearmed
Panicque feares. His acts were not
many, for ought that can bee found
in records, the cheefest was that hee
challenged Cupid at wrestling, in
which conflict hee had the foile.

The tale goes too that hee caught
the Giant Typhon in a net, and held
him fast. Moreouer when Ceres
(grumling and chafing that Proserpina
was rauished) had hid her selfe
away, and that all the Gods tooke
pains (by dispersing themselues into
euery corner) to find her out, it was
onely his good hap (as hee was hunting)
to light on her, and acquaint
the rest where she was. He presumed
also to put it to the tryall who was
the better Musitian hee or Apollo,
and by the iudgment of Midas was
indeed preferred: But the wise iudge
had a paire of Asses eares priuily
chopt to his Nodle for his sentence.
Of his louetrickes, there is nothing
reported, or at least not much, a
thing to be wondred at, especially
being among a troope of Gods so
profusly amorous. This onely is
said of him, that hee loued the
Nymph Eccho (whom he tooke to
wyfe) and one pretty wench more
called Syrinx, towards whom Cupid
(in an angry and reuengefull humor

because so audaciously hee had
challenged him at wrestling) inflamed
his desire. Moreouer hee had
no issue (which is a maruell also,
seeing the Gods, especially those of
the Malekind, were very generatiue)
onely hee was the reputed father
of a litle Girle called lambe, that
with many pretty tales was wont to
make strangers merry: but some
thinke hee did indeed beget her by
his wife lambe. This (if any bee) is
a noble tale, as being laid out, and
bigg bellied with the secrets and mysteries
of nature.
               
                  Pan (as his name imports) represents
and lays open the All of things
or Nature. Concerning his originall
there are two onely opinions
that goe for currant: for either hee
came of Mercury, that is, the word
of God, which the holy Scriptures
without all controuersie affirme, &amp;
such of the Philosophers as had any
smacke of diuinity assented vnto:
or els from the confused seedes of
things. For they that would haue

one simple beginning referre it vnto
God: or if a materiate beginning,
they would haue it various in power.
So that wee may end the controuersie
with this distribution that
the world tooke beginning either
from Mercury, or from the seeds of
all things.

                     
                        Virg. Eolog. 6.
                        Namque canebat vti magnum per
inane coacta
                        Semina, terrarumque, animaeque, marisque
fuissent,
                        Et liquidi simulignis: &amp; his exordia
primis
                        Omnia, &amp; ipse tener mundi concreuerit
Orbis.
                     
                     
                        For rich-vaind Orpheus sweetly
did rehearse
                        How that the seeds of fire, ayre,
water, earth,
                        Were all pact in the vast void
vniuerse:
                        And how from these all firstlings
all had birth,
                        
                           
And how the bodie of this Orbicque
frame
                        From tender infancy so bigg
became.
                     
                  
But as touching the third conceipt
of Pans originall, it seemes that the
Grecians (either by intercourse with
the Egyptians or one way or other)
had heard something of the Hebrew
mysteries: for it points to the state
of the world not considered in immediate
creation, but after the fall
of Adam, exposed and made subiect
to death and corruption: for in that
state it was (and remains to this day)
the ofspring of God and Sinne. And
therefore all these three narrations,
concerning the manner of Pans
birth, may seeme to bee true, if it
bee rightly distinguished betweene
things and times. For this Pan or
nature (which wee suspect, contemplate,
and reuerence more then is
fit) tooke beginning from the word
of God by the meanes of confused
matter, and the entrance of preuarication

and corruption. The Destinies
may well be thought the Sisters
of Pan or Nature, because the
beginnings, and continuances, and
corruptions, and depressions, and
dissolutions, and eminences, and labours,
and felicities of things, and all
the chances which can happen vnto
any thing are linckt with the
chaines of causes naturall.
               
                  Hornes are attributed vnto him,
because Hornes are broad at the
roote and sharpe at the ends, the nature
of all things being like a Pyramis
sharpe at the Toppe. For indiuiduall
or singular things being infinite
are first collected into Species,
which are many also; then from
Species into generals, and from generals
(by ascending) are contracted
into things or notions more generall,
so that at length Nature may
seeme to be contracted into a vnity.
Neither is it to be wondred at, that
Pan toucheth heauen with his
hornes, seeing the height of nature
or vniuersall Ideas doe in some sort,

pertaine to things diuine, and there
is a ready and shorte passage from
Metaphysicke to naturall Theologie.
               
               The body of Nature is elegantly
and with deepe iudgement depainted
hairy, representing the beames
or operations of creatures: for
beames are as it were the haires and
bristles of Nature, and euery creature
is either more or lesse beamie,
which is most apparent in the facultie
of seeing, and no lesse in euery
vertue and operation that effectuals
vpon a distant obiect: for whatsoeuer
workes vp any thing afarre off;
that may rightly bee saide to darte
forth rayes or beames.
               Moreouer Pans beard is said to
bee exceeding long, because the
beames or influences of celestiall
bodies doe operate and pierce farthest
of all, and the Sunne when
(his higher halfe is shadowed with
a cloud) his beames breake out in
the lower, and lookes as if he were
bearded.
               
                  Nature is also excellently set

forth with a biformed body, with
respect to the differences betweene
superiour and inferiour creatures.
For the one part by reason of their
pulchritude, &amp; equabilitie of motiō,
&amp; constancy, &amp; dominion ouer the
earth &amp; earthly things, is worthily
set out by the shape of man: and the
other part in respect of their perturbations
and vnconstant motions
(and therefore needing to be moderated
by the celestiall) may be well
fitted with the figure of a brute
beast. This description of his body
perteines also to the participation
of Species, for no naturall beeing
seemes to be simple, but as it were
participating and compounded of
two. As for example; man hath somthing
of a beast: a beast something
of a plant: a plant something of a
inanimate bodie, so that all naturall
things are in very deed biformed,
that is to say compounded of a Superiour,
and inferiour Species.
               
               It is a wittie Allegorie that same
of the feet of a Goate, by reason of

the vpward tending motion of terrestriall
bodies towards the ayer
and heauen: For the Goate is a clyming
creature, that loues to bee
hanging about the rockes and steep
mountaines; And this is done also
in a wonderfull manner, euen by
those things which are destinated
to this inferiour globe, as may manifestly
appeare in cloudes and Meteors.
               The two Ensignes which Pan
beares in his hands do point, the one
at Harmony, the other at Empiry:
for the Pipe consisting of seauen
reedes doth euidently demonstrate
the concent and harmony and discordant
concord of all inferior creatures,
which is caused by the motion
of the seuen Planets: And that of the
Shep-hooke may be excellently applied
to the order of nature, which
is partly right, partly crooked: This
staffe therefore or rodde is especially
crooked in the vpper end, because
all the workes of diuine prouidence
in the world are done in a far fetcht

and circular manner, so that one
thing may seeme to be effected, and
yet indeed a cleane cōtrary brought
to passe, as the selling of Ioseph into
Egypt, and the like. Besides in all
wise humane gouerment, they that
sit at the helme doe more happily
bring their purposes about, and insinuate
more easily into the minds
of the people, by pretexts and oblique
courses, then by direct methods;
so that all Scepters and Mases
of authority ought in very deed
to be crooked in the vpper end.
               
                  Pans cloake or mantle is ingeniously
fained to be the skin of a Leopard,
because it is full of spottes: so
the heauens are spotted with stars,
the sea with rockes and Islands, the
land with flowers, and euery particular
creature also is for the most
part garnished with diuers colours
about the supersicies, which is as it
were a mantle vnto it.
               The office of Pan can bee by nothing
so liuely conceaued and exprest,
as by fayning him to bee the

God of hunters, for euery naturall
action, and so by consequence, motion
and progression, is nothing els
but a hunting. Arts and Sciences
haue their workes, and humane
counsels their ends which they earnestly
hunt after. All naturall things
haue either their food as a prey, or
their pleasure as a recreation which
they seeke for, and that in most expert
and sagacious manner.
               
                  Torua Leaena Lupum sequitur, Lupus
ille Capellam:
                  Florentem Cythisum sequitur lasciua
Capella.
               
               
                  The hungry Lionesse (with sharp
desire)
                  Pursues the Wolfe, the Wolfe
the wanton Goate:
                  The Goate againe doth greedily
aspire.
                  To haue the trifol-iuyce passe
downe her throate.
               
               
                  Pan is also saide to bee the God of
the countrey Clownes, because men

of this condition lead liues more agreeable
vnto nature, then those
that liue in the Cities and Courts of
Princes, where nature by too much
arte is corrupted: So as the saying
of the Poet (though in the sense of
loue) might be here verified:
               
                  Pars minima est ipsa puella sui.
               
               
                  The maid so trickt her selfe with
arte.
                  That of her selfe shee is least
parte.
               
               Hee was held to be Lord President
of the mountaines, because in
high mountaines and hilles, Nature
layes herselfe most open, and men
most apt to viewe and contemplation.
               Whereas Pan is said to bee (next
vnto Mercury) the messenger of the
Gods, there is in that a diuine Mystery
cōteined, for next to the word
of God the image of the world proclaimes
the power and wisedome diuine,
as sings the sacred Poet. Psal.

19. 1. Caeli enarrant gloriam Dei,
atque opera manuum eius indicat firmamentum.
The heauens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament
sheweth the workes of his
hands.
               The Nymphes, that is, the soules
of liuing things take great delight in
Pan: For these soules are the delights
or minions of Nature, and the direction
or conduct of these Nymphes
is with great reason attributed vnto
Pan, because the soules of all things
liuing doe follow their naturall dispositions
as their guides, and with
infinite varietie euery one of them
after his own fashion doth leape and
friske and dance with incessant motion
about her. The Satyres and Sileni
also, to wit, youth and old age
are some of Pans followers: for of
all naturall things there is a liuely
iocund and (as I may say) a dauncing
age, and an age againe that is
dull bibling and reeling. The cariages
and dispositions of both which
ages to some such as Democritus was

(that would obserue them duely)
might peraduenture seeme as ridiculous
and deformed as the gambols
of the Satyrs, or the gestures of
the Sileni.
               
               Of those feares and terrours
which Pan is said to be the Author,
there may be this wise construction
made, namely, That nature hath
bredde in euery liuing thing a kinde
of care and feare tending to the preseruation
of its owne life and being,
and to the repelling and shunning
of all things hurtfull. And yet Nature
knowes not how to keepe a
meane, but alwaies intermixes vaine
and emptie feares with such as are
discreet and profitable; so that all
things (if their insides might bee
seene) would appeare full of Panicque
frights: but men especially
in hard and fearefull, and diuers
times are wonderfully infatuated
with superstition, which indeed is
nothing els but a Panicque terrour.
               Concerning the audacity of Pan
in challenging Cupid at wrestling,

the meaning of it is, that Matter
wants no inclination and desire to
the relapsing and dissolution of the
world into the old Chaos, if her malice
and violence were not restrained
and kept in order, by the prepotent
vnitie and agreement of things
signified by Cupid, or the God of
loue; And therefore it was a happie
turne for men and all things els,
that in that conflict Pan was found
too weake and ouercome.
               To the same effect may be interpreted
his catching of Typhon in a
net: for howsoeuer there may sometimes
happen vast and vnwonted
Tumors (as the name of Typhon
imports) either in the sea or in the
ayre, or in the earth, or els where,
yet Nature doth intangle in an intricate
toile, and curbe &amp; restraine,
as it were, with a chaine of Adamant
the excesses and insolences of
these kind of bodies.
               But for as much as it was Pans
good fortune to finde out Ceres as
he was hunting, and thought little

of it, which none of the other Gods
could doe, though they did nothing
els but seeke her, and that very
seriously, it giues vs this true and
graue admonition, That we expect
not to receaue things necessary for
life and manners from philosophicall
abstractions, as from the greater
Gods, albeit they applied themselues
to no other studie, but from
Pan, that is from discreet obseruation,
&amp; experience, and the vniuersall
knowledge of the things of this
world, whereby (oftentimes euen
by chance, and as it were going a
hunting) such inuentions are lighted
vpon.
               The quarrell he made with Apollo
about Musicke, and the euent
thereof conteines a wholsome instruction,
which may serue to restraine
mens reasons and iudgements
with the reines of sobriety
from boasting and glorying in their
gifts. For there seemes to be a twofold
Harmonie, or Musicke; the one
of diuine prouidence, and the other

of humane reason. Now to the eares
of mortals, that is to humane iudgement,
the administration of the
world and the creatures therein, and
the more secret iudgements of God,
sound very hard and harsh; which
folly albeit it bee well set out with
Asses eares, yet notwithstanding
these eares are secret, and doe not
openly appeare, neither is it perceiued
or noted as a deformity by the
vulgar.
               Lastly, it is not to be wondred at,
that there is nothing attributed vnto
Pan concerning loues, but onely
of his mariage with Eccho: For the
World or Nature doth enioy it
selfe, and in it selfe all things els.
Now hee that loues would enioy
something, but where there is
inough there is no place left to desire.
Therefore there can be no wanton
loue in Pan or the World, nor
desire to obteine any thing (seeing
he is contented with himselfe) but
onely speeches, which (if plaine)
may bee intimated by the Nymph

                  Eccho, or, if more quaint, by Syrinx.
It is an excellent inuention, that Pan
or the world is said to make choise
of Eccho onely (aboue all other
speeches or voices) for his wife:
for that alone is true philosophy,
which doth faithfully render the very
words of the world, and is written
no otherwise then the world
doth dictate, it being nothing els
but the image or reflection of it, not
adding any thing of its owne, but
onely iterates and resounds. It belongs
also to the sufficiency or perfection
of the World, that the begets
no issue: for the World doth generate,
in respect of its parts, but in respect,
of the whole, how can it generate,
seeing without it there is no
body? Notwithstanding all this, the
tale of that tatling Girle faltred vpon
Pan may in very deed with great
reason be added to the Fable: for
by her are represented those vaine
and idle paradoxes concerning the
nature of things which haue bene
frequent in all ages, and haue filled

the world with nouelties, fruitles if
you respect the matter, changlings
if you respect the kind, sometimes
creating pleasure, sometimes tediosnes
with their ouermuch pratling.
            
            
               7.
               PERSEVS, or Warre.
               
                  PErseus is said to haue beene emploied
by Pallas for the destroying
of Medusa, who was very
infestious to the western parts of
the world, and especially about the
vtmost coasts of Hyberia. A monster
to dire and horrid, that by her
onely aspect shee turned men into
stones. This Medusa alone of all
the Gorgons was Mortall, the rest not
subiect to death. Perseus therefore
preparing himself for this noble enterprise
had armes, and guifts bestowed
on him by three of the
Gods: Mercury gaue him wings
annexed to his heeles, Pluto a helmet,
Pallas a sheild and a looking
Glasse. Notwithstanding (although

hee were thus furnished) hee went
not directly to Medusa, but first to
the Greae which by the mother side
were sisters to the Gorgons. These
Greae from their birth were hoare-headed,
resembling old women.
They had but one onely eye, and
one tooth among them all, both
which shee that had occasion to goe
abroad was wont to take with her,
&amp; at her returne to lay them downe
againe. This eye and tooth they
lent to Perseus: and so finding himselfe
throughly furnished for the effecting
of his designe hastens towards
Medusa. Her hee found sleeping,
and yet durst not present himselfe
with his face towards her, least
shee should awake, but turning his
head aside beheld her in Pallases
glasse, and (by this meanes directing
his blowe) cut of her head,
from whose blood gusshing out instātly
came Pegasus the flying horse.
Her head thus smit of, Perseus bestows
on Pallas her sheild, which yet
reteined his vertue, that whosoeuer

looked vpon it should become as
stupid as a stone or like one plannet-strucken.
               This Fable seemes to direct the
preparation and order, that is to be
vsed in making of Warre: for the
more apt &amp; considerat vndertaking
whereof, three graue and wholsome
precepts (sauouring of the wisedome
of Pallas) are to be obserued.
               First, that men doe not much
trouble themselues about the conquest
of neighbour nations, seeing
that priuate possessions, &amp; Empires
are inlarged by different meanes: for
in the augmentation of priuate reuenues
the vicinity of mens territories
is to bee considered: but in the
propogation of publike dominions,
the occasion and facility of making
Warre, and the fruit to bee expected
ought to be in steed of vicinity.
Certeinly the Romans what time
their conquests towards the West
scarce reacht beyond Liguria, did
yet in the East bring all the Prouinces
as far as the mountain Taurus
                  
within the compasse of their
armes and commaund: and therefore
Perseus, although he were borne
and bred in the East, did not yet refuse
to vndertake an expedition
euen to the vttermost bounds of the
West.
               Secondly, there must bee a care
had that the motiues of Warre bee
iust and honorable: for that begets
an alacrity, aswel in the Souldiers
that fight, as in the people that
affoord pay: it draws on and procures
aids, and brings manie other
comodities besides. But there is no
pretence to take vp armes more
pious, then the suppressing of Tyrāny,
vnder which yoake the people
loose there courage, and are cast
downe without heart &amp; vigor, as in
the sight of Medusa.
               
               Thirdly, it is wisely added; that
seeing there were three Gorgons (by
which Wars are represented) Perseus
vndertooke her onely that was mortal,
that is hee made choice of such
a kind of War as was likely to bee

effected and brought to a period, not
pursuing vast and endles hopes.
               The furnishing of Perseus with
necessaries was that which only aduanced
his attempt &amp; drew fortune
to bee of his side: For hee had speed
from Mercury, concealing of his
counsels from Orcus, and Prouidence
from Pallas.
               
               Neither is it without an Allegory,
and that ful of matter to, that
those wings of celerity were fastned
to Perseus his heeles, and not to his
anckles, to his feet and not to his
shoulders; because speed and celerity
is required, not so much in the
first preparationes for Warre, as in
those things which second &amp; yeeld
ayd to the first: for there is no error
in Warre more frequent, then that
prosecutions and subsidiary forces
doe faile to answer the alacrity of the
first onsets.
               Now for that helmet which Pluto
gaue him; powerful to make men
inuisible, the moral is plaine: But
that two-fould guift of prouidence

(to wit the sheild &amp; looking glasse)
is ful of morality: for that kind of
prouidēce which like a sheild auoids
the force of blows is not alone
needfull, but that also by which the
strength, and motions, and councels
of the enemy are descried, as in
the looking glasse of Pallas.
               
               But Perseus albeit he were sufficiently
furnished with aid and courage,
yet was hee to doe one thing
of speciall importance before hee
entred the lists with this Monster, &amp;
that was to haue some intelligence
with the Greae. These Greae are treasōs
which may be termed the Sisters
of Warre, not descended of the same
stocke, but farre vnlike in nobility
of birth; for Warres are generall
and heroicall, but Treasons are base
and ignoble. Their description is
elegant: for they are said to bee
grayheaded, and like old women
from their birth, by reason that
Traitors are continually vext with
cares and trepidations. But all their
strength (before they breake out

               8
               ENDYMION, or a Fauorite.
               IT is saide that Luna was in loue
with the Shepheard Endymion,
and in a strange and vnwonted manner
bewrayed her affection: for he
lying in a Caue framed by nature
vnder the mountaine Latmus, shee
oftentimes descended from her
sphere to enioy his companie as he
slept, and after shee had kissed him
ascended vp againe. Yet notwithstanding
this his idlenes and sleepie
security did not any way impaire his
estate or fortune; for Luna brought
it so to passe that hee alone (of all
the rest of the Shepheards) had
his flocke in best plight, and most
fruitfull.
               This Fable may haue reference
to the nature and disposition of
Princes: for they beeing full of
doubts and prone to iealousie, doe
not easily acquaint men of prying
and curious eyes, and as it were of

vigilant and wakefull dispositions,
with the secret humours and manners
of their life: but such rather as
are of quiet and obseruant natures,
suffering them to doe what they list
without further scanning, making
as if they were ignorant and perceiuing
nothing, but of a stupid disposition
and possest with sleepe, yeelding
vnto them simple obedience,
rather then slie complements: for it
pleaseth Princes now and then to
descend from their thrones of Maiestie
(like Luna from the superiour
orbe) and laying aside their Robes
of dignity (which alwaies to bee
cumbred with, would seeme a kinde
of burthen) familiarly to conuerse
with men of this condition, which
they thinke may bee done without
danger; a quality chiefly noted in
Tiberius Caesar, who (of all others)
was a Prince most seuere, yet such
onely were gracious in his fauour,
as being well acquainted with his
disposition, did yet constantly dissemble
as if they knew nothing.

This was the custome also of Lewis
the eleuenth king of France, a cautious
and wily Prince.
               Neither is it without elegancy,
that the caue of Endymion is mentioned
in the Fable, because it is a thing
vsuall with such as are the fauorites
of Princes, to haue certaine pleasant
retyring places whither to inuite
them for recreation both of body
and mind, and that without hurt
or preiudice to their fortunes also.
And indeed these kind of fauorites
are men commonly well to passe:
for Princes although peraduenture
they promote them not euer to places
of honour, yet doe they aduance
them sufficiently by their favour
and countenance: neither
doe they affect them thus onely to
serue their owne turne, but are
wont to enrich them now and then
with great dignities and bounties.
            
            
               
               9.
               THE SISTER OF THE
GYANTS, or Fame.
               IT is a Poeticall relation that the
Gyants begotten of the Earth
made warre vpon Iupiter, and the
other Gods, and by the force of
lightning they were resisted &amp; ouerthrowne.
Whereat the Earth being
excitated to wrath, in reuenge of her
children brought forth Fame, the
youngest Sister of the Gyants.
               
                  Illam, terra parens ira irritata Deorum.
                  Extremam (vt perhibent) Caeo Enceladoque
sororem,
                  Progenuit.—
               
               
                  Prouok't by wrothfull Gods the
mother Earth
                  Giues Fame the Gyants yongest
sister birth.
               
               The meaning of the Fable seemes
to bee thus, By the Earth is signified

the nature of the vulgar, alwaies
swolne and malignant, and still broaching
new scandals against superiors,
and hauing gotten fit oportunity,
stirres vp rebels, and seditious
persons, that with impious
courage doe molest Princes, and
endeuour to subuert their estates:
but being supprest, the same naturall
disposition of the people stil leaning
to the viler sort, (being impatient
of peace and tranquility)
spread rumors, raise malitious slanders,
repining whisperings, infamous
libelles, and others of that
kind, to the detraction of them that
are in authority: So as rebellious
actions, and seditious reports, differ
nothing in kind and blood, but as it
were in Sex onely; the one sort
being Masculine, the other Feminine.
            
            
               
               10.
               ACTAEON, and PENTHEVS,
or a curious Man.
               THe curiosity of Men, in prying
into secrets, and coueting with
an indiscreet desire to atteine the
knowledge of things forbidden, is
set forth by the Ancients in two examples:
the one of Actaeon, the
other of Pentheus.
               
               
                  Actaeon hauing vnawares, and
as it were by chance beheld Diana
naked, was turned into a Stag, and
deuoured by his owne Dogges.
               And Pentheus climing vp into a
tree, with a desire to bee a spectator
of the hidden sacrifices of Bacchus,
was strucken with such a kind of
frensie, as that whatsoeuer he look't
vpon, he thought it alwaies double,
supposing (among other things) he
saw two Sunnes, and two Thebes;
insomuch that running towards
Thebes, spying another Thebes, instantly
turned back againe, and so

kept stil running forward and backward
with perpetuall vnrest.
               
                  Eumenidum veluti demens videt
agmina Pentheus,
                  Et Solem geminum, &amp; duplices se
ostendere Thebas.
               
               
                  Pentheus amaz'd doth troops of
furies spie,
                  And Sunne and Thebes seeme
dooble to his eye.
               
               The first of the Fables pertains
to the secrets of Princes: the second
to diuine mysteries. For those that
are neare about Princes, and come
to the knowledge of more secretes
then they would haue them, doe
certainly incurre great hatred. And
therefore (suspecting that they are
shot at, &amp; opportunities watcht for
their ouerthrow) doe lead their
liues like Stagges, fearefull and full
of suspition. And it happens oftentimes
that their Seruants, and those
of their houshould (to insinuate into
the Princes fauor) doe accuse them

to their destruction: for against
whomsoeuer the Princes displeasure
is knowne, looke how many seruants
that man hath, and you shall
find them for the most part so many
traytors vnto him, that his end may
proue to bee like Actaeons.
               
               The other is the misery of Pentheus:
for they that by the height
of knowledge in nature and philosophy,
hauing climed, as it were,
into a tree, doe with rash attempts
(vnmindfull of their frailtie) pry into
the secrets of diuine mysteries, and
are iustly plagued with perpetuall
inconstancy, and with wauering
and perplexed conceits: for seeing
the light of nature is one thing, and
of grace another, it happens so to
them as if they saw two Sunnes. And
seeing the actions of life, and decrees
of will doe depend of the vnderstanding,
it follows that they
doubt, and are inconstant no lesse in
will then in opinion, and so in like
manner they may bee said to see
two Thebes: for by Thebes (seeing

there was the habitation and refuge
of Pentheus) is meant the ende of
actions. Hence it comes to passe
that they knowe not whither they
goe, but as distracted and vnresolued
in the scope of their intentions,
are in all things caried about with
sudden passions of the mind.
            
            
               11
               ORPHEVS, or Philisophy.
               THe tale of Orpheus, though
common, had neuer the fortune
to bee fitly applyed in euery
point. It may seeme to represent the
image of Philosophy: for the person
of Orpheus (a man admirable
and diuine, and so excellently skilled
in all kinde of harmony, that
with his sweet rauishing musicke he
did as it were charme and allure all
things to follow him) may cary a
singular description of Philosophy:
for the labours of Orpheus doe so far
exceed the labors of Hercules, in dignity
&amp; efficacy, as the works of wisdom,
excell the works offortitude.
               
                  
                  Orpheus for the loue hee bare to
his wife (snacht as it were from him
by vntimely death) resolued to goe
downe to Hell with his Harpe, to
try if hee might obtaine her of the
infernall powers. Neither were his
hopes frustrated: for hauing appeased
them with the melodious sound
of his voice and touch, preuailed at
length so farre, as that they granted
him leaue to take her away with
him, but on this condition that shee
should follow him, and hee not to
looke backe vpon her, till he came
to the light of the vpper world,
which he (impatient of, our of loue
and care, and thinking that he was
in a manner past all danger) neuerthelesse
violated, insomuch that the
couenant is broken, and shee forthwith
tumbles backe againe headlong
into hell. From that time Orpheus
falling into a deepe melancholy
became a contemner of women
kind, and bequeathed himselfe to a
solitary life in the deserts, where by
the same melody of his voice and

harpe, hee first drew all manner of
wild beasts vnto him, who (forgetfull
of their sauage fiercenes, and
casting off the precipitate prouocations
of lust and fury, not caring to
satiate their voracity by hunting after
prey) as at a Theater in fawning
and reconciled amity one towards
another, stand all at the gaze about
him, and attentiuely lend their eares
to his Musicke. Neither is this all:
for so great was the power and alluring
force of his harmony, that he
drew the woods &amp; moued the very
stones to come and place themselues
in an orderly and decent fashion about
him. These things succeeding
happily and with great admiration
for a time, at length certaine Thracian
Women (possest with the spirit
of Bacchus) made such a horrid
and strange noise with their Cornets,
that the sound of Orpheus harp
could no more be heard, insomuch
as that Harmony, which was the
bond of that order and society beeing
dissolued, all dissorder began

againe, and the beasts (returning to
their wonted nature) pursued one
another vnto death as before: neither
did the trees or stones remaine
any longer in their places: and Orpheus
himselfe was by these femall
Furies torne in pieces, and scattered
all ouer the desart. For whose cruell
death the riuer Helicon (sacred to
the Muses) in horrible indignation,
hid his head vnder ground, and raised
it againe in another place.
               The meaning of this Fable seemes
to be thus. Orpheus musicke is of
two sorts, the one appeasing the infernall
powers, the other attracting
beasts and trees. The first may bee
fitly applyed to naturall philosophie,
the second to morall or ciuill
discipline.
               The most noble worke of naturall
philosophy, is the restitution
and renouation of things corruptible,
the other (as a lesser degree of
it) the preseruation of bodies in
their estate, deteining them from
dissolution and putrefaction. And if

this gift may be in mortals, certenly
it can be done by no other meanes
then by the due and exquisite temper
of nature, as by the melody and
delicate touch of an instrument. But
seeing it is of all things the most difficult,
it is seldome or neuer attained
vnto, and in all likelyhood for
no other reason, more then through
curious diligence and vntimely impatience.
And therefore Philosophy
hardly able to produce so excellent
an effect, in a pensiue humour
(and not without cause) busies herselfe
about humane obiects, and by
perswasion and eloquence, insinuating
the loue of vertue, equitie, and
concord in the minds of men, draws
multitudes of people to a society,
makes them subiect to lawes, obedient
to gouerment, and forgetfull
of their vnbridled affections, whilst
they giue eare to precepts, and submit
themselues to discipline, whence
followes the building of houses, erecting
of townes, and planting of
fields and orchards, with trees and

the like, insomuch that it would not
be amisse to say, that euen thereby
stones, and woods were called together,
and setled in order. And after
serious tryall made and frustrated
about the restoring of a body
mortall; this care of ciuill affaires
followes in his due place: Because
by a plaine demonstration of the
vneuitable necessity of death, mens
minds are moued to seeke eternity
by the fame and glory of their merits.
It is wisely also said in the Fable,
that Orpheus was auerse from the
loue of women and mariage, because
the delights of wedlocke and
loue of children doe for the most
part hinder men from enterprising
great and noble designes for the
publique good, holding posterity a
sufficient step to immortalitie without
actions.
               Besides euen the very workes of
wisedome, (although amongst all
humane things they doe most excell)
doe neuerthelesse meete with
their periods. For it happens that

(after kingdomes and commonwealths
haue flourished for a time)
euen tumults, and seditions, and
warres arise; in the midst of which
hurly burlies: first, lawes are silent,
men returne to the prauity of their
natures, fields and townes are wasted
and depopulated, and then, (if
this fury continue) learning and
philosophy must needs be dismembred,
so that a few fragments onely,
and in some places will bee found
like the scattered boords of shipwracke,
so as a barbarous age must
follow; and the streames of Helicon
being hid vnder the earth vntill
(the vicissitude of things passing)
they breake out againe and appeare
in some other remote nation,
though not perhaps in the same
climate.

               COELVM, or Beginnings.
               WEe haue it from the Poets
by tradition, that Coelum
was the ancientest of the Gods, and
that his mēbers of generation were
cut off by his sonne Saturne. Saturne
had many children, but deuoured
them as soone as they were borne.
Iupiter onely escapt, who being
come to mans estate, thrust Saturne
his father into hell, and so vsurped
the kingdome. Moreouer he pared
off his fathers genitals with the same
faulchin that Saturne dismembred
Coelum, and cast them into the Sea,
from whence came Venus. Not
long after this, Iupiter (being scarce
setled and confirmed in this kingdome)
was inuaded by two memorable
warres. The first of the
Titans, in the suppressing of which
Sol (who alone of all the Titans fauouring
Iupiters side) tooke exceeding
great pains. The second was

of the Gyants, whom Iupiter himselfe
destroied with thunderboults,
and so all warres being ended, hee
raigned secure.
               This Fable seemes enigmatically
to shew from whence all things
tooke their beginning, not much
differring from that opinion of philosophers,
which Democritus afterwards
laboured to mainteine, attributing
eternity to the first Matter
and not to the world. In which he
comes somwhat neere the truth of
diuine writ, telling vs of a huge deformed
Masse, before the beginning
of the six daies worke.
               The meaning of the Fable is this,
By Coelum may be vnderstood that
vast concauity, or vaulted compasse
that comprehends all matter: and by
Saturne may bee meant the matter
it selfe, which takes from its Parent
all power of generating: for the
vniuersality or whole bulke of matter
alwaies remaines the same, neither
increasing or diminishing in
respect of the quality of its nature:

But by the diuers agitations and
motions of it were first produced
imperfect, &amp; ill agreeing cōpositiōs
of things, making, as it were certaine
worlds for proofes or assaies,
and so in processe of time a perfect
fabricke or structure was framed,
which should still reteine and keepe
his forme. And therefore the gouerment
of the first age was shaddowed
by the kingdome of Saturne,
who for the frequent dissolutions &amp;
short continuances of things was
aptly fained to deuoure his children.
The succeeding gouerment was deciphered
by the raigne of Iupiter,
who confined those continuall mutations
vnto Tartarus, a place signifying
perturbation. This place
seemes to bee all that middle space
between the lower Superficies of
Heauen and the center of the Earth:
in which all perturbation and fragility
and mortality or corruption
are frequent. During the former
generation of things in the time of
Saturns raigne, Venus was not borne:

for so long as in the vniuersality of
Matter, discord was better &amp; more
preualent then concord, it was necessary
that there should bee a totall
dissolution or mutation, and that in
the whole fabricke. And by this
kind of generation were creatures
produced before Saturne was depriued
of his genitalles. When this
ceased, that other which is wrought
by Venus, immediately came in, consisting
in setled and preualent concord
of things, so that Mutation
should bee onely in respect of the
parts, the vniuersall fabrick remaining
whole and inuiolate.
               
                  Saturne they say was deposed &amp;
cast downe into Hell, but not destroyed
and vtterly extinguisht, because
there was an opinion that the
world should relapse into the old
Chaos &amp; interregnum againe, which
Lucretius praied might not happen
in his time.

                     
                        Quod procul a nobis, flectat fortuna
gubernans
                        
                           Et ratio potius quam res persuadeat
ipsa.
                     
                     
                        Oh guiding prouidence bee gratious,
                        That this Doomes-day bee farre
remou'd from vs.
                        And graunt that by vs it may bee
expected,
                        Rather then on vs in our times
effected.
                     
                  
for afterward the world should subsist
by its owne quantity and power.
Yet from the beginning there was
no rest: for in the celestiall Regions
there first followed notable mutations,
which by the power
of the Sunne (predominating ouer
superior bodies) were so quieted,
that the state of the world should be
conserued: and afterward (in inferior
bodies) by the suppressing and
dissipating of inundations, tempests,
winds, and generall earthquakes,
a more peacefull &amp; durable
agreement and tranquility of things

followed. But of this Fable it may
conuertibly be said, that the Fable
conteines philosophy, and philosophy
againe the Fable: For wee know
by faith, that all these things are
nothing els but the long-since ceasing
and failing Oracles of Sence,
seeing that both the Matter and Fabrick
of the world are most truly referred
to a Creator.
            
            
               13.
               PROTEVS, or Matter.
               THe Poets say that Proteus was
Neptunes heard-man, a graue
Syer, and so excellent a prophet, that
hee might well bee termed thrice
excellent: for hee knew not onely
things to come; but euen things past
aswell as present, so that besides his
skill in diuination, hee was the messenger
and interpreter of all Antiquities
and hidden mysteries. The
place of his abode was a huge vast
caue, where his custome was euery
day at noone to count his flock of

Sea-calues, and then to goe to sleep.
Moreouer he that desired his aduice
in any thing, could by no other
meanes obteine it, but by catching
him in Manacles, and holding him
fast therewith; who neuerthelesse
to bee at liberty would turne himselfe
into all manner of formes and
wonders of nature, somtimes into
fire, somtimes into water, somtimes
into the shape of beasts and the like,
till at length he were restored to his
owne forme againe.
               This Fable may seeme to vnfold
the secrets of nature, and the properties
of Matter. For vnder the person
of Proteus, the first Matter
(which next to God is the auncientest
thing) may be represented: for
Matter dwelles in the concauity of
heauen as in a Caue.
               He is Neptunes bond-man, because
the operations and dispensations
of Matter are chiefly exercised
in liquid bodies.
               His flocke or heard seemes to be
nothing but the ordinary Species of

sensible creatures, plants, and mettals:
in which Matter seemes to diffuse
and as it were spend it selfe, so
that after the forming and perfecting
of these kinds, (hauing ended
as it were her taske) shee seemes to
sleepe and take her rest, not attempting
the composition of any more
Species. And this may be the Morall
of Proteus his counting of his
flocke, and of his sleeping.
               Now this is said to be done, not
in the morning, nor in the euening,
but at noone, to wit at such time as
is most fit, and conuenient for the
perfecting and bringing forth of
Species out of Matter, duely prepared
and predisposed, and in the middle,
as it were, betweene their beginnings
and declinations, which wee
know sufficiently (out of the holy
history) to be done about the time
of the Creation: for then by the
power of that diuine word (Producat)
Matter at the Creators commaund
did congregate it selfe (not
by ambages or turnings, but instantly

to the production of its worke
into act and the constitution of Species.
And thus farre haue wee the
Narration of Proteus (free, and vnrestrained)
together with his flocke
compleat: for the vniuersality of
things with their ordinary structures
and compositions of Species
beares the face of matter not limited
and constrained, and of the flocke
also of materiall beings. Neuerthelesse,
if any expert Minister of Nature,
shall encounter Matter by main
force, vexing, and vrging her with
intent and purpose to reduce her to
nothing; shee contrariwise (seeing
annihilation and absolute destruction
cannot be effected but by the
omnipotency of God) being thus
caught in the straites of necessitie,
doth change and turne her selfe into
diuers strange formes and shapes of
things, so that at length (by fetching
a circuit, as it were) shee comes
to a period, and (if the force continue)
be takes her selfe to her former
being. The reason of which constraint

or binding will bee more facile
and expedite, if Matter be laide
hold on by Manacles, that is, by extremities.
               Nowe whereas it is fained that
Proteus was a prophet, well skilled
in three differences of times, it hath
an excellent agreement with the nature
of Matter: for it is necessary
that he that will knowe the properties
and proceedings of Matter,
should comprehend in his vnderstanding
the summe of all things,
which haue bene, which are, or
which shall be, although no knowledge
can extend so farre as to singular
and indiuiduall beings.
            
            
               14
               MEMNON, or a youth too
forward.
               THe Poets say, that Memnon was
the sonne of Aurora, who
(adorned with beautifull armour,
and animated with popular applause)
came to the Troiane warre:

where (in a rash boldnes, hasting vnto,
and thristing after glory) he enters
into single combate with Achilles
the valiantest of all the Grecians,
by whose powerfull hand he
was there slaine. But Iupiter pittying
his destruction, sent birds to
modulate certaine lamentable and
dolefull notes at the Solemnization
of his funerall obsequies. Whose
statue also (the Sunne reflecting
on it with his morning beames) did
vsually (as is reported) send forth a
mournfull sound.
               This Fable may be applied to the
vnfortunate destinies of hopefull
young men, who like the sonnes of
Aurora (puft vp with the glittering
shew of vanity and ostentation) attempt
actions aboue their strength,
and prouoke and presse the most valiant
Heroes to combate with them,
so that (meeting with their ouermatch)
are vanquished and destroyed,
whose vntimely death is oft accompanied
with much pitty and
commiseration. For among all the

disasters that can happen to mortals,
there is none so lamentable
and so powrefull to moue compassion
as the flower of vertue
cropt with too sudden a mischance.
Neither hath it beene often
knowne that men in their greene
yeares become so loathsome and odious,
as that at their deathes
either sorrow is stinted, or commiseration
moderated: but that lamentation
and mourning doe not
onely flutter about their obsequies
like those funerall birds; but this
pittifull commiseration doth continue
for a long space, and especially
by occasions and new motions,
and beginning of great matters,
as it were by the morning raies
of the Sunne, their passions and desires
are renued.
            
            
               
               15.
               TITHONVS, or Satiety
               IT is elegantly fained that Tithonus
was the paromour of Aurora,
who (desirous for euer to enjoy his
company) petitioned Iupiter that
he might neuer dye, but (through
womanish ouersight) forgetting to
insert this clause in her petition, that
he might not withall grow old and
feeble, it followed that he was onely
freed from the condition of mortality,
but for old age, that came vpon
him in a maruelous and miserable
fashion, agreeable to the state of
those who cannot die, yet euery day
grow weaker and weaker with age.
Insomuch that Iupiter (in commiseratio
of this his misery) did at length
metamorphose him into a Grashopper.
               This Fable seemes to bee an ingenuous
Character or description
of pleasure, which in the beginning,
&amp; as it were in the morning seemes

to be so pleasant and delightfull that
men desire they might enjoy &amp; monopolize
it for euer vnto thēselues,
vnmindfull of that Satiety and loathing,
which (like old age) will
come vpon them before they bee
aware. And so at last (when the vse
of pleasure leaues men, the desire &amp;
affection not yet yeilding vnto
death) it comes to passe that men
please themselues onely by talking
and commemorating those things
which brought pleasure vnto them
in the flower of their age, which
may be obserued in libidinous persons,
and also in men of military
professions: the one delighting in
beastly talke, the other boasting of
their valorous deeds like Grashoppers,
whose vigor consists onely in
their voyce.
            
            
               
               16.
               IVNOS SVTOR, or
Basenesse.
               THe Poets say, that Iupiter to
enioy his lustfull delights tooke
vpon him the shape of sundry creatures,
as of a Bull, of an Eagle, of a
Swane, and of a goulden shower: but
being a Sutor to Iuno hee came in a
forme most ignoble and Base, an
obiect full of contempt and scorne,
resembling indeed a miserable Cuckow,
weather-beaten with raine &amp;
tempest, nummed, quaking, and
halfe dead with coulde.
               This Fable is wise and seemes to
bee taken out of the bowels of morallity,
the sence of it being this,
That men boast not too much of
themselues, thinking by ostentation
of their owne worth to insinuate
themselues into estimation and
fauor with men, the successe of such
intentions being for the most part
measured by the nature and disposition

of those to whom men sue for
grace: Who if of themselues they
bee indowed with no guifts and ornaments
of nature, but are onely of
haughtie and malignant spirits (intimated
by the person of Iuno) then
are Sutors to know that it is good
policy to omit all kind of apparance
that may any way shew their
owne least praise or worth: and
that they much deceiue themselues
in taking any other course. Neither
is it inough to shew deformity in obsequiousnes,
vnlesse they also appeare
euen abiect and base in their
very persons.
            
            
               17.
               CVPID, or an Atome.
               THat which the Poets say of
Cupid or Loue cannot properly
be attributed to one and the selfe
same person; and yet the difference
is such, that (by reiecting the confusion
of persons) the similitude
may be receaued.
               
                  
They say that Loue is the ancientest
of all the Gods, and of all
things els except Chaos, which
they hould to bee a contemporary
with it. Now as touching Chaos,
that by the ancients was neuer dignified
with diuine honour, or with
the title of a God. And as for
Loue, they absolutely bring him in
without a father, onely some are of
opinion that hee came of an Egge
which was laid by Nox, and that on
Chaos hee begot the Gods and all
things els. There are fower things
attributed vnto him, perpetuall infancy,
blindnes, nakednes, and
an Archery. There was also another
Loue which was the yongest
of the Gods, and he, they say, was
the Sonne of Venus. On this also
they bestowe the attributes of the
elder Loue, as in some sort well applie
vnto him.
               This Fable tends and lookes to
the Cradle of Nature, Loue seeming
to bee the appetite or desire of the
first matter, or (to speake more

plaine) the naturall motion of the
Atome, which is that ancient and
onely power that formes and fashions
all things out of Matter, of
which there is no Parent, that is to
say, no cause, seeing euery cause is as
a parent to its effect. Of this power
or vertue there can bee no cause in
Nature (as for God, we alwaies except
him) for nothing was before it,
and therefore no efficient cause of
it. Neither was there any thing better
knowen to nature, and therefore
neither Genus nor Forme. Wherefore
whatsoeuer it is, positiue it is,
and but inexpressible. Moreouer, if
the manner and proceeding of it,
were to be conceiued, yet could it
not bee by any cause, seeing that
(next vnto God) it is the cause of
causes, it selfe onely without any
cause. And perchance there is no
likely hood, that the manner of it
may bee conteined or comprehended
within the narrow compasse of
humane search. Not without reason
therefore is it fained to come of an

Egge which was layed by Nox. Certenly
the diuine Philosopher grants
so much. Eccl. 3. 11. Cuncta fecit
tempestatibus suis pulchra, &amp; mundum
tradidit disputationibus eorum,
it a tamen vt non inueniat homo opus,
quod operatus est Deus, a principio ad
finem. That is, he hath made euery
thing beautifull in their seasons, also
he hath set the world in their meditations,
yet cannot man find out
the worke that God hath wrought,
from the beginning euen to the end.
For the principall law of Nature, or
power of this desire, created (by
God) in these parcels of things, for
concurring and meeting together
(from whose repetitions and
multiplications, all variety of creatures
proceeded and were composed)
may dazzle the eies of mens
vnderstandings, and comprehended
it can hardly bee. The Greeke
Philosophers are obserued to be very
acute and diligent in searching
out the materiall principles of
things: but in the beginnings of

motion (wherein consists all the efficacy
of operation) they are negligent
and weake, and in this that wee
handle, they seeme to be altogether
blind and stammering: for the opinion
of the Peripatetickes concerning
the appetite of Matter caused
by Priuation, is in a manner nothing
els but words, which rather sound
then signifie any realty. And those
that referre it vnto God, doe very
well, but then they leape vp, they
ascend not by degrees: for doubtles
there is one chiefe lawe subordinate
to God, in which all naturall things
concurre and meete, the same that
in the fore-cited Scripture is demonstrated
in these words. Opus,
quod operatus est Deus a principio vsque
ad finem, the worke that God
hath wrought from the beginning
euen to the ende. But Democritus
which entred more deepely into the
consideration of this point after he
had conceaued an Atome with
some small dimension and forme, he
attributed vnto it one onely desire,

or first motion simply or absolutely,
and another comparatiuely or in
respect: for hee thought that all
things did properly tend to the center
of the world, whereof those bodies
which were more materiall descended
with swifter motion, and
those that had lesse matter did on
the contrary tend vpward. But this
meditation was very shallow conteyning
lesse then was expedient:
for neither the turning of the celestiall
bodies in a round, nor shutting
and opening of things may seeme
to be reduced or applied to this beginning.
And as for that opinion
of Epicurus concerning the casuall
declination and agitation of the
Atome, it is but a meere toy, and a
plaine euidence, that he was ignorant
of that point. It is therefore
more apparent (then wee could
wish) that this Cupid or Loue remaines
as yet clouded vnder the
shades of Night. Now as concerning
his attributes: Hee is elegantly
described with perpetuall infancie

desire to some indiuiduall nature,
so that the generall disposition
comes from Venus, the more exact
sympathy from Cupid, the one deriued
from causes more neere,
the other from beginnings more
remote and fatall, and as it were
from the elder Cupid, of whom euery
exquisite sympathie doth depend.
            
            
               18
               DIOMEDES, or Zeale.
               
                  DIomedes flourishing with great
fame and glory in the Troian
warres, and in high fauour with Pallas
was by her instigated (beeing indeed
forwarder then he should haue
bene) not to forbeare Venus a iote,
if he encountred with her in fight,
which very boldly hee performed,
wounding her in the right arme.
This presumptuous fact hee caried
cleare for a while, and being honored
and renowned for his many heroicke
deeds; at last returned into

his owne countrey, where finding
himselfe hard besteed with domesticke
troubles, fled into Italy, betaking
himselfe to the protection of
Forreiners, where in the beginning
he was fortunate and royally entertained
by King Daunus with sumptuous
gifts, raising many statues in
honour of him throughout his dominions.
But vpon the very first
calamity that hapned vnto this nation
whereunto he was fled for succor:
King Daunus enters into a conceipt
with himselfe that he had entertained
a wicked guest into his family,
and a man odious to the Gods
and an impugner of their Diuinity,
that had dared with his sword to
assault and wound that Goddesse,
whom in their religion they held it
sacrilege so much as to touch. Therfore,
that he might expiat his countreyes
guilt (nothing respecting the
duties of hospitality, when the
bonds of Religion tyed him with a
more reuerend regarde) suddenly
slew Diomedes, commanding withall

               DAEDALVS, or Mechanique.
               MEchanicall wisedome and industry,
and in it vnlawfull
science peruerted to wrong ends, is
shadowed by the Ancients vnder
the person of Daedalus, a man ingenious,
but execrable. This Daedalus
(for murthering his fellow seruant
that emulated him) being
bannished, was kindly interteined
(during his exile) in many cities,
and Princes Courts: for indeed he
was the raiser and builder of many
goodly structures, as well in honour
of the Gods, as for the beautie and
magnificence of cities, and other
publick places: but for his works of
mischeefe he is most notorious. It is
he which framed that engine which
Pasiphae vsed to satisfie her lust in
companying with a bull, so that by

this his wretched industrie and pernicious
deuice, that Monster Minotaur
(the destruction of so many
hopefull youthes) tooke his accursed
and infamous beginning, and
studying to couer and increase one
mischeife with another, for the security
&amp; preseruation of this Monster
hee inuented and built a Labyrinth,
a worke for intent and vse
most nefarious and wicked, for
skill and workmanship famous and
excellent. Afterward that he might
not bee noted onely for works of
mischeefe, but be sought after as
well for remedies, as for instruments
of destruction; hee was the
Author of that ingenious deuice
concerning the clue of threed, by
which the Labyrinth was made passable
without any let. This Daedalus
was persecuted by Minos with
great seuerity, diligence and inquiry,
but he always found the meanes to
auoid and escape his tyranny. Lastly
he taught his sonne Icarus to flie,
but the nouice in ostentation of his

art soaring too high, fell into the
Sea, and was drowned.
               The Parable seemes to be thus:
In the beginning of it may be noted
that kind of enuie or emulation that
lodgeth and wonderfully swaies and
domineers amongst excellent artificers,
there being no kinde of people
more reciprocally tormented
with bitter and deadly hatred then
they.
               The bannishment also of Dedalus
(a punishment inflicted on
him against the rules of policy and
prouidence) is worth the nothing:
for Artificers haue this prerogatiue
to find enterteinment and welcome
in all countries, so that exile to an
excellent workman can hardly bee
termed a punishment, whereas other
conditions and states of life can
scarce liue out of their owne country.
The admiration of artificers
is propogated and increast in forrein
and strange nations, seeing it is a
naturall and inbred disposition of
men to value their owne countrimen

(in respect of Mechanicall
works) lesse then strangers.
               Concerning the vse of Mechanicall
arts, that which follows is
plaine. The life of man is much
beholding to them, seeing many
things (conducing to the ornament
of religion, to the grace of ciuill
discipline, and to the beautifying
of all humane kind) are extracted
out of their treasuries: and yet notwithstanding
from the same Megazine
or storehouse are produced instruments
both of lust and death,
for (to omit the wiles of bandes) we
well know how farre exquisit poisons,
warlike engines, and such
like mischeifs (the effects of Mechanicall
inuentions) doe exceed the
Minotaur himselfe in malignity &amp;
sauage cruelty.
               Moreouer, that of the Labyrinth
is an excellent Allegory, whereby is
shadowed the nature of Mechanicall
sciences: for all such handicrafte
works as are more ingenious
and accurate, may bee compared

to a Labyrinth in respect of subtilty
and diuers intricate passages, and
in other plaine resemblances, which
by the eye of iudgement can hardly
be guided and discerned, but onely
by the line of experience.
               Neither is it impertinently added,
that hee which inuented the intricate
nooks of the Labyrinth, did
also shew the cōmodity of the clue:
for Mechanicall arts are of ambiguous
vse, seruing as well for hurt
as for remedy, and they haue in a
manner power both to loose and
bind themselues.
               Vnlawfull trades, and so by consequence
arts themselues are often
persecuted by Minos, that is by
lawes, which doe condemne them
and prohibit men to vse them. Neuerthelesse
they are hid and retained
euery where, finding lurking holes,
and places of receipt, which was
well obserued by Tacitus of the Mathematicians
and figure flingers of
his time in a thing not much vnlike;
Genus (inquit) hominum quod in ciuitate

nostra semper &amp; retinebitur &amp;
vetabitur. There is a kind of men
(faith hee) that will always abide in
our Citie though always forbiddē.
And yet notwithstanding vnlawfull
&amp; curious arts of what kind soeuer,
in tract of time, when they cannot
performe what they promise, doe
fall from the good opinion that was
held of them (no otherwise then
Icarus fell downe from the skies)
they growe to be contemned and
scorned, and so perish by too much
ostentation. And, to say the truth,
they are not so happily restreined by
the raines of law, as bewraied by
their owne vanitie.

               ERICTHONIVS, or Imposture.
               THe Poets fable that Vulcan sollicited
Minerua for her virginity,
and impatient of deniall with
an inflamed desire offered her violence,
but in struggling his Seed fell
vpon the ground, whereof came

mother they cast them behind their
backs, which at first struck them
with great amazement and dispaire,
seeing (all things being defaced by
the flood) it would be an endles
worke to find their mothers sepulcher,
but at length they vnderstood
that by bones the stones of the earth
(seeing the earth was the mother of
all things) were signified by the
Oracle.
               This Fable seemes to reueale a
secret of Nature, and to correct an
error familiar to mens conceipts:
for through want of knowledge,
men thinke that things may take renouation
and restauration from
their putrefaction and dregs, no
otherwise then the Phoenix from the
ashes, which in no case can be admitted,
seing such kind of materials,
when they haue fulfilled their periods,
are vnapt for the beginings
of such things: wee must therefore
looke back to more common principles.
            
            
               
               22.
               NEMESIS, or the Vicissitude
of things.
               
                  NEmesis is said to be a Goddesse
venerable vnto all, but to bee
feared of none but potentates and
fortunes fauorites. She is thought
to be the Daughter of Oceanus and
Nox. Shee is purtrayed with
wings on her shoulders, and on her
head a Coronet; bearing in her right
hand a iauelin of Ash, and in her
left a Pitcher with the similitudes of
Aethiopians engrauen on it: and
lastly shee is described sitting on a
Hart.
               The Parable may bee thus vnfolded.
Her name Nemesis doth
plainly signifie. Reuenge or Retribution,
her office and administration
being (like a Tribune of the people)
to hinder the constant &amp; perpetuall
felicity of happy men, and to interpose
her word, veto, I forbid the continuance
of it, that is, not onely to

chastice insolency, but to intermix
prosperity (though harmles and in
a meane) with the vicissitudes of
aduersity, as if it were a custome,
that noe mortall man should be admitted
to the Table of the Gods but
for sport. Truly when I read that
Chapter, wherein Caius Plinius
hath collected the misfortunes and
miseries of Augustus Caesar, whom
of all men I thought the most happy,
who had also a kind of arte to
vse and inioy his fortune, and in
whose mind might be noted neither
pride, nor lightnes, nor nicenes, nor
disorder, nor melancholly (as that
he had appointed a time to die of his
owne accord) I then deemed this
Goddesse to be great and powerfull,
to whose altar so worthy a sacrifice
as this was drawen.
               The Parents of this Goddesse
were Oceanus and Nox that is, the vicissitude
of things, and diuine iudgement
obscure and secret: for the alterations
of things are aptly represented
by the Sea, in respect of the

continuall ebbing and flowing of
it: and hidden prouidence is well
set forth by the Night: for euen the
nocturnall Nemesis (seeing humane
iudgement differs much from diuine)
was seriously obserued by the
heathen.
               
                  Virgill Aeneid. lib. 2.
                  —Cadit &amp; Ripheus instissimus
vnus,
                  Qui fuit ex Teucris, &amp; seruantissimus
equi,
                  Dijs aliter visum—.
               
               
                  That day by Greekish force was
Ripheus slaine,
                  So iust and strict obseruer of the
law,
                  As Troy within her walles did
not containe
                  A better man: Yet God then
good it saw.
               
               Shee is described with wings, because
the changes of things are so
sudden, as that they are seene, before

foreseene: for in the Records of all
ages, wee finde it for the most part
true, that great potentates, and wise
men haue perished by those misfortunes
which they most contemned,
as may be obserued in Marcus Cicero,
who being admonished by Decius
Brutus of Octauius Cesars hippocriticall
friendshippe and hollow
heartednes towards him, returnes
this answere; Te autem, mi Brute, sicut
debeo, amo, quod istud quicquid est
nugarum me scire voluisti. I must euer
acknowledge my selfe (Deare
Brutus) beholding to thee, in loue,
for that thou hast bene so carefull
to acquaint mee with that which
I esteeme but as a needles trifle to
be doubted.
               
                  Nemesis is also adorned with a
Coronet, to shew the enuious and
malignant disposition of the vulgar,
for when fortunes fauourites and
great potentates come to ruine,
then doe the common people reioyce,
setting as it were a crowne
vpon the head of reuenge.
               
                  
The Iauelin in her right hand
points at those, whom shee actually
strikes and pierceth thorow.
               And before those, whom shee destroyes
not in their calamitie and
misfortune, shee euer presents that
blacke and dismall spectacle in her
left hand: for questionles to men
sitting, as it were, vpon the pinnacle
of prosperity, the thoughts of death
&amp; painfulnes of sicknes and misfortunes,
perfidiousnes of friends, treachery
of foes, change of state, and
such like, seeme as ougly to the eye
of their meditations, as those Ethiopians
pictured in Nemesis her Pitcher.
Virgill in describing the battell
of Actium, speakes thus elegantly
of Cleopatra.

                  The Queene amidst this hurly
burly stands,
                  
                     
And with her Countrey Timbrell
calles her bands;
                  Not spying yet where crawld behind
her backe
                  Two deadly Snakes with venom
speckled blacke.
               
               But not long after, which way
soeuer shee turned, troops of Ethiopians
were still before her eies.
               Lastly, it is wisely added, that Nemesis
rides vpon an Hart, because a
Hart is a most liuely creature. And
albeit it may be, that such as are cut
off by death in their youth, preuent
and shunne the power of Nemesis,
yet doubtles such, whose prosperity
and power continue long, are made
subiect vnto her, and lye as it were
troden vnder her feete.
            
            
               23.
               ACHELOVS, or Battell.
               IT is a Fable of antiquitie, that
when Hercules and Achelous as
riuals contended for the mariage of

                  Deianira, the matter drew them to
combate, wherein Achelous tooke
vpon him many diuers shapes, for
so was it in his power to doe, and
amongst others, transforming himselfe
into the likenes of a furious
wild Bull, assaults Hercules and prouokes
him to fight. But Hercules for
all this, sticking to his old humane
forme, couragiously encounters
him, &amp; so the combate goes roundly
on. But this was the euent, that
Hercules tore away one of the Buls
hornes, wherewith he being mightily
daunted and greeued, to ransome
his horne againe, was contented
to giue Hercules in exchange
thereof, the Anealthean horne, or
Cornu-Copia.
               
               This Fable hath relation vnto the
expeditions of warre, for the preparations
thereof on the defensiue
parte (which exprest in the person
of Achelous) is very diuers and vncertaine.
But the inuading party is
most commonly of one sorte, and
that very single, consisting of an armie

by land, or perhaps of a Nauie
by Sea. But for a King that in his
owne Territorie expects an enemy,
his occasions are infinite. He fortifies
townes, he assembles men out
of the countreyes and villages, hee
raiseth Cittadels, hee builds and
breakes downe bridges, hee disposeth
garrisons, and placeth troopes
of Soldiers on passages of riuers,
on ports, on Mountaines, and ambushes
in woods, and is busied with
a multitude of other directions, insomuch
that euery day he prescribeth
new formes and orders, and
then at last hauing accomodated
all things compleat for defence, he
then rightly represents the forme
and manner of a fierce fighting
Bull. On the other side, the inuader
his greatest care is, the feare to bee
distressed for victuals in an enemy
Countrey. And therefore affects
chiefly to hasten on battell: for if it
should happen that after a fielde
fought, he proue the victor, and as
it were breake the horne of the Enemy,

then certainly this follows that
his enemy being strucken with terrour
and abased in his reputation,
presently bewraies his weaknes, and
seeking to repaire his losse, retyres
himselfe to some strong hold, abandoning
to the Conqueror the spoile
and sacke of his countrey and citties:
which may well bee termed a
type of the Amalthean horne.
            
            
               24.
               DIONYSVS, or Passions.
               THey say that Semele Iupiters
Sweet-heart (hauing bound
her Paramour by an irreuocable
oath to grant her one request which
shee would require) desired that he
would accompany her in the same
forme, wherein hee accompanied
Iuno: which he granting (as not able
to deny) it came to passe that the
miserable wench was burnt with
lightning. But the infant which she
bare in her wombe, Iupiter the Father
tooke out, and kept it in a gash

which hee cut in his thigh, till the
moneths were compleat that it
should be borne. This burden made
Iupiter somewhat to limpe, whereupon
the child (because it was heauy
and troublesome to its Father,
while it lay in his thigh) was called
Dionysus, Being borne, it was committed
to Proserpina for some yeeres
to be nurs't, and being growne vp,
it had such a maiden face, as that a
man could hardly iudge whether it
were a boy or a girle. He was dead
also, and buried for a time, but afterward
reuiued. Being but a youth
he inuented, and taught the planting
and dressing of Vines, the making
also and vse of wine, for which
becomming famous and renowned,
he subiugated the world, euen to
the vttermost bounds of India. He
rode in a Chariot drawen with Tygers.
There danc't about him certaine
deformed hobgoblins called
Cobali, Aoratus, and others, yea euen
the Muses also were some of his followers.
Hee tooke to wife Ariadne,
                  
forsaken and left by Theseus. The
tree sacred vnto him was the Iuie.
He was held the inuentor and institutor
of Sacrifices, and Ceremonies,
and full of corruption and cruelty.
Hee had power to strike men
with fury or madnes; for it is reported,
that at the celebration of
his Orgies, two famous worthies,
Pentheus and Orpheus were torne in
pieces by certaine franticke women,
the one because he got vpon a tree
to behold their ceremonies in these
sacrifices, the other for making melodie
with his harpe. And for his
gests, they are in a manner the same
with Iupiters.
               
               There is such excellent morality
coucht in this Fable, as that Morall
philosophy affoords not better:
for vnder the person of Bacchus is
described the nature of affection,
passion, or perturbation, the mother
of which (though neuer so hurtful)
is nothing els but the obiect of apparent
good in the eies of Appetite.
And it is alwaies conceiued in an

vnlawfull desire rashly propounded
and obteined, before well vnderstood
and considered, and when it
beginnes to growe, the Mother of
it, which is the desire of apparent
good by too much feruency is destroyed
and perisheth: Neuerthelesse
(whilst it is yet an imperfect
Embrio) it is nourished and preserued
in the humane soule, (which is
as it were a father vnto it, and represented
by Iupiter) but especially in
the inferiour parte thereof, as in a
thigh, where also it causeth so much
trouble and vexation, as that good
determinations and actions are
much hindred and lamed thereby,
and when it comes to be confirmed
by consent and habite, and breakes
out, as it were, into act, it remaines
yet a while, with Proserpina as with
a Nurse, that is, it seekes corners and
secret places, and, as it were, caues
vnder ground, vntill (the reines of
shame and feare being laid aside in
a pampered audaciousnes) it either
takes the pretext of some vertue, or

becomes altogether impudent and
shameles. And it is most true, that
euery vehement passion is of a
doubtfull sexe, as being masculine
in the first motion, but faeminine in
prosecution.
               It is an excellent fiction that of
Bacchus his reuiuing: for passions
doe somtimes seeme to be in a dead
sleepe, and as it were vtterly extinct,
but wee should not thinke them to
be so indeed, no, though they lay, as
it were, in their graue; for, let there
be but matter and opportunitie offered,
and you shall see them quickly
to reuiue againe.
               The inuention of wine is wittily
ascribed vnto him, euery affection
being ingenious and skilfull in finding
out that which brings nourishment
vnto it; And indeed of all
things knowen to men, Wine is
most powerfull and efficacious to
excite and kindle passions of what
kind soeuer, as being in a manner,
a common Nurse to them all.
               Againe his conquering of Nations,

and vndertaking infinite expeditions
is an elegant deuice; For
desire neuer rests content with what
it hath, but with an infinite and vnsatiable
appetite still couets and
gapes after more.
               His Chariot also is well said to be
drawen by Tygers: for as soone as
any affection shall from going afoot,
be aduanc't to ride in a Chariot
and shall captiuate reason, and
leade her in a triumph, it growes
cruell, vntamed, and fierce, against
whatsoeuer withstands or opposeth
it.
               It is worth the nothing also, that
those ridiculous hobgoblins are
brought in, dancing about his Chariot:
for euery passion doth cause,
in the eies, face, and gesture, certaine
vndecent, and ill-seeming,
apish, and deformed motions, so
that they who in any kind of passion,
as in anger, arrogancy, or loue,
seeme glorious and braue in their
owne eies, do yet appeare to others
misshapen and ridiculous.
               
                  
In that the Muses are saide to be
of his company, it shewes that there
is no affection almost which is not
soothed by some Art, wherein the
indulgence of wits doth derogate
from the glory of the Muses, who
(when they ought to bee the Mistresses
of life) are made the waiting
maids of affections.
               Againe, where Bacchus is saide to
haue loued Ariadne that was reiected
by Theseus; it is an Allegory of
speciall obseruation: for it is most
certaine, that passions alwaies couet
and desire that which experience
forsakes, and they all knowe
(who haue paide deare for seruing
and obeying their lusts) that whether
it be honour, or riches, or delight,
or glory, or knowledge, or
any thing els which they seeke after,
yet are they but things cast off,
and by diuers men in all ages, after
experience had, vtterly reiected and
loathed.
               Neither is it without a mysterie,
that the Iuie was sacred to Bacchus:
                  
for the application holds, first, in
that the Iuie remaines greene in
winter. Secondly, in that it stickes
too, embraceth, and ouertoppeth
so many diuers bodies, as trees,
walles, and edifices. Touching the
first, euery passion doth by resistance,
and reluctation, and as it
were by an Antiparistasis (like the
Iuie of the colde of winter) growe
fresh and lusty. And as for the other
euery predominate affection
doth againe (like the Iuie) embrace
and limite all humane actions and
determinations, adhering and cleauing
fast vnto them.
               Neither is it a wonder, that superstitious
rites, and ceremonies
were attributed vnto Bacchus seeing
euery giddy headed humour keepes
in a manner, Reuell-rout in false
religions: or that the cause of madnes
should bee ascribed vnto him,
seeing euery affection is by nature
a short fury, which (if it growe vehement,
and become habituall)
concludes madnes.
               
                  
Concerning the rending and
dismembring of Pentheus and Orpheus,
the parable is plaine, for euery
preualent affection is outragious
and seuere against curious inquiry,
and wholsome and free admonition.
               Lastly, that confusion of Iupiter
and Bacchus, their persons may be
well transferred to a parable, seeing
noble and famous acts, and remarkable
and glorious merits, doe sometimes
proceed from vertue, and well
ordered reason, and magnanimitie,
and sometimes from a secret affection,
and hidden passion, which
are so dignified with the celebritie
of fame and glory, that a man can
hardly distinguish betweene the
actes of Bacchus, and the gests of
Iupiter.
               
            
            
               
               25.
               ATALANTA, or Gaine.
               
                  ATalanta who was reputed to
excell in swiftnesse, would
needs challenge Hippomanes at a
match in running. The conditions
of the Prize were these: That if Hippomanes
wonne the race, he should
espouse Atalanta; If he were outrunne,
that then hee should forfeit
his life. And in the opinion of all,
the victorie was thought assured of
Atalantas side, beeing famous as
shee was for her matchlesse and inconquerable
speed, whereby shee
had bene the bane of many. Hippomanes
therefore bethinkes him how
to deceiue her by a tricke, and in
that regarde prouides three golden
apples, or balles which he purposely
caried about him. The race is
begunne, and Atalanta gets a good
start before him. Hee seeing himselfe
thus cast behind, being mindfull
of his deuice, throwes one of

his golden balles before her, and
yet not outright, but somewhat of
the one side, both to make her linger,
and also to draw her out of the
right course: shee out of a womanish
desire, (beeing thus enticed
with the beautie of the golden apple)
leauing her direct race, runnes
aside, and stoops to catch the ball:
Hippomanes the while holds on his
course, getting thereby a great start,
and leaues her behind him: But shee
by her owne naturall swiftnes, recouers
her lost time, and gets before
him againe. But Hippomanes still
continues his sleight, and both the
second and third times casts out his
balles, those enticing delayes; and
so by craft and not by his actiuitie
winnes the race and victorie.
               This Fable seemes allegorically
to demonstrate a notable conflict
betweene Art and Nature: for Art
(signified by Atalanta) in its worke
(if it be not letted and hindred) is
farre more swift then Nature, more
speedie in pace; and sooner attaines

the end it aimes at, which is manifest
almost in euery effect: As you
may see in fruit-trees, whereof those
that growe of a kernell are long ere
they beare, but such as are grafted
on a stocke a great deale sooner.
You may see it in Clay, which in
the generation of stones, is long ere
it become hard, but in the burning
of Brickes, is very quickly effected.
Also in morall passages you may
obserue, that it is a long time ere
(by the benefit of Nature) sorrowe
can be asswaged and comfort attained,
whereas Philosophy (which is,
as it were, Art of liuing) taries not
the leasure of time, but doth it instantly,
and out of hand; And yet
this prerogatiue and singular agility
of Art is hindred by certaine golden
apples, to the infinite preiudice of
humane proceedings: for there is
not any one Art or Science which
constantly perseueres in a true and
lawfull course, till it come to the
proposed ende or marke: but euer
and anone makes stops, after good

beginnings, leaues the race, and
turnes aside to profite and commoditie,
like Atalanta.
                  
                     
                        Declinat cursus, aurum
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            volubile
tollit.
                     
                     
                        Who doth her course forsake,
                        The rolling gold to take.
                     
                  
And therefore it is no wonder that
Art hath not the power to conquer
Nature, and by pact or lawe of conquest,
to kill and destroy her: but
on the contrary, it falles out, that
Art becomes subiect to Nature, and
yeelds the obedience, as of a wife to
her husband.
            
            
               26.
               PROMETHEVS, or the State
of man.
               THe Ancients deliuer, that Prometheus
made a man of Clay,
mixt with certaine parcels taken
from diuers animales, who studying
to maintaine this his worke by Art

(that he might not be accounted a
founder onely, but a propagator of
humane kinde) stole vp to heauen
with a bundle of twigs, which hee
kindling at the Chariot of the Sun,
came downe againe, and communicated
it with men: And yet they
say, that (notwithstanding this excellent
worke of his) he was requited
with ingratitude, in a treacherous
conspiracie: For they accused
both him and his inuention to Iupiter,
which was not so taken as
was meet it should, for the information
was pleasing to Iupiter and all
the Gods. And therefore in a merry
mood, graunted vnto men, not
onely the vse of fire, but perpetuall
youth also, a boone most acceptable
and desireable. They being, as
it were, ouerioyed, did foolishly lay
this gift of the Gods vpon the backe
of an asse, who being wonderfully
opprest with thirst, and neere a
fountaine, was tolde by a Serpent
(which had the custody thereof)
that hee should not drinke, vnlesse

he would promise to giue him the
burden that was on his backe. The
silly Asse accepted the condition,
and so the restauration of youth
(sold for a draught of water) past
from men to Serpents. But Prometheus
full of malice, being reconciled
vnto men, after they were frustrated
of their gift, but in a chafe
yet with Iupiter, feared not to vse
deceit in Sacrifice: for hauing killed
two Bulles, and in one of their
hides wrapt vp the flesh and fat of
them both, and in the other onely
the bones, with a great shew of religious
deuotion, gaue Iupiter his
choise, who (detesting his fraude
and hypocrisie, but taking an occasion
of reuenge) chose that that
was stuft with bones, and so turning
to reuenge (when hee saw that the
insolencie of Prometheus would not
be repressed, but by laying some
grieuous affliction vpon mankind,
in the forming of which, hee so
much bragged and boasted) commanded
Vulcan, to frame a goodly

beautifull woman, which beeing
done, euery one of the Gods bestowed
a gift on her; whereupon
shee was called Pandora. To this
woman they gaue in her hand, a
goodly Box, full of all miseries and
calamities, onely in the bottome of
it, they put Hope: With this Box
shee comes first to Prometheus, thinking
to catch him, if peraduenture,
he should accept it at her hands,
and so open it: which he neuerthelesse,
with good prouidence and
foresight refused. Whereupon shee
goes to Epimetheus (who, though
brother to Prometheus, yet was of a
much differing disposition) and offers
this Box vnto him, who, without
delay, tooke it, and rashly opened
it, but when hee sawe that all
kind of miseries came fluttering about
his eares, being wise too late,
with great speed and earnest indeauour,
clapt on the couer, and so,
with much adoe, retained Hope sitting
alone in the bottome. At last
Iupiter laying many and grieuous

crimes to Prometheus his charge (as
namely that he had stollen fire from
heauen, that in contempt of his
Maiestie, he sacrificed a bulles hide
stuft with bones, that he scornfully
reiected his gift, and besides all this
that hee offered violence to Pallas)
cast him into chaines, and doomd
him to perpetuall torment: and by
Iupiters command, was brought to
the mountaine Caucasus, and there
bound fast to a pillar that he could
not stirre; there came an Eagle also,
that euery day sate tyring vpon
his liuar, and wasted it, but as much
as was eaten in the day, grew againe
in the night, that matter for torment
to worke vpon might neuer decay.
But yet, they say, there was an end
of this punishment: for Hercules
crossing the Ocean in a Cup, which
the Sun gaue him, came to Caucasus,
and set Prometheus at libertie, by
shooting the Eagle with an arrowe.
Moreouer in some nations there
were instituted in the honor of Prometheus,
certaine games of Lampbearers,

in which they that striued
for the prize, were wont to carie
torches lighted; which, who so suffered
to goe out, yeelded the place
and victory to those that followed,
and so cast backe themselues, so
that whosoeuer came first to the
marke with his torch burning, got
the prize.
               This Fable demonstrates and
presseth many true and graue speculations,
wherein some things haue
bene heretofore well noted, others
not so much as toucht.
               
                  Prometheus doth cleerely and
elegantly signifie Prouidence: For in
the vniuersality of nature, the fabricque
and constitution of Man
onely was by the Ancients pict out
and chosen, and attributed vnto
Prouidence, as a peculiar worke.
The reason of it seemes to bee, not
onely in that the nature of man is
capable of a minde and vnderstanding,
which is the seate of Prouidence,
and therefore it would seeme
strange and incredible that the reason

and minde should so proceed
and flowe from dumbe and deafe
principles, as that it should necessarily
be concluded, the soule of man
to be indued with prouidence, not
without the example, intention, and
stampe of a greater prouidence. But
this also is chiefly propounded, that
man is as it were, the center of the
world, in respect of finall causes, so
that if man were not in nature, all
things would seeme to stray and
wander without purpose, and like
scattered branches (as they say)
without inclination to their ende:
for all things attend on man, and he
makes vse of, and gathers fruit from
all creatures: for the reuolutions
and periods of Starres make both
for the distinctions of times, and
the distribution of the worlds site.
Meteors also are referred to the
Presages of tempests; and winds are
ordained, as well for nauigation, as
for turning of Milles, and other engines:
and plants, and animals of
what kind soeuer, are vsefull either

for mens houses, and places of shelter,
or for raiment, or food, or medicine,
or for ease of labour, or in a
word, for delight and solace, so that
all things seeme to worke, not for
themselues, but for man.
               Neither is it added without consideration,
that certaine particles
were taken from diuers liuing creatures,
&amp; mixt &amp; tempered with that
clayie masse, because it is most true
that of all things comprehended
within the compasse of the vniuerse,
Man is a thing most mixt and compounded,
insomuch that hee was
well termed by the Ancients, A little
world: for although the Chymicques
doe, with too much curiositie,
take and wrest the elegancie of
this word (Microcosme) to the letter,
contending to finde in man all
minerals, all vegetables and the rest,
or any thing that holds proportion
with them, yet this proposition remaines
sound and whole, that the
body of man, of all material beings,
is found to bee most compounded,

and most organicall, whereby it is
indued and furnished with most admirable
vertues and faculties. And
as for simple bodies, their powers
are not many, though certaine and
violent, as existing without being
weakned, diminished, or stented by
mixture: for the multiplicitie and
excellencie of operation haue their
residence in mixture and composition,
and yet neuerthelesse, man in
his originals, seemes to be a thing
vnarmed, and naked, and vnable to
helpe it selfe, as needing the aide of
many things; therefore Prometheus
made haste to finde out fire, which
suppeditates and yeelds comfort
and helpe, in a manner, to all humane
wants and necessities: so that
if the soule be the forme of formes,
and if the hand be the instrument of
instruments; fire deserues well to
be called the succour of succours, or
the helpe of helpes, which infinite
waies affoords ayde and assistance to
all labours and mechanicall artes,
and to the sciences themselues.
               
                  The manner of stealing this fire
is aptly described, euen from the nature
of the thing: It was, as they say,
by a bundle of twigs held to touch
the Chariot of the Sunne: for twigs
are vsed in giuing blowes or stripes,
to signifie clearely, that fire is ingendred
by the violent percussion,
and mutuall collision of bodies, by
which their materiall substances are
attenuated, and set in motion, and
prepared to receiue the heat or influence
of the heauenly bodies, and
so, in a clandestine manner, and as it
were, by stealth, may be said to take
and snatch fire from the Chariot of
the Sunne.
               There followes next a remarkable
part of the parable, That men
in steed of gratulation, and thanksgiuing,
were angry, and expostulated
the matter with Prometheus, insomuch
that they accused both him
and his inuention vnto Iupiter,
which was so acceptable vnto him,
that hee augmented their former
commodities with a new bountie.

Seemes it not strange, that ingratitude
towards the authour of a benefit
(a vice that, in a manner, containes
all other vices) should
find such approbation and reward?
No, it seemes to be otherwise: for
the meaning of the Allegory is this,
That mens outcries vpon the defects
of nature and Arte, proceed
from an excellent disposition of the
minde, and turne to their good,
whereas the silencing of them is
hatefull to the Gods, and redounds
not so much to their profit: For they
that infinitly extoll humane nature,
or the knowledge they possesse,
breaking out into a prodigall admiration
of that they haue and enioy,
adoring also those sciences they
professe, would haue them be accounted
perfect; they doe first of all
shewe little reuerence to the diuine
nature, by equalizing, in a manner,
their owne defects with Gods perfection;
Againe, they are wonderfull
iniurious to men, by imagining
they haue attained the highest step

of knowledge (resting themselues
contented) seeke no further. On
the contrary, such as bring nature
and Art to the barre with accusations
and billes of complaint against
them, are indeed of more true and
moderate iudgements, for they are
euer in action, seeking alwaies to
finde out new inuentions. Which
makes mee much to wonder at the
foolish and inconsiderate dispositions
of some men, who (making
themselues bondslaues to the arrogancy
of a fewe) haue the philosophy
of the Peripateticques (containing
onely a portion of Graecian
wisedome, and that but a small one
neither) in so great esteeme, that
they hold it, not onely an vnprofitable,
but a suspicious, and almost
hainous thing, to lay any imputation
of imperfection vpon it. I approue
rather of Empedocles his opinion,
(who like a madman, and of
Democritus his iudgement, who
with great moderation complained
how that all things were inuolued

in a mist) that wee knew nothing,
that wee discerned nothing, that
trueth was drowned in the depthes
of obscuritie, and that false things
were wonderfully ioynd and intermixt
with true (as for the new Academie
that exceeded all measure)
then of the confident and pronuntiatiue
schoole of Aristotle. Let
men therefore be admonished, that
by acknowledging the imperfections
of Nature and Arte, they are
gratefull to the Gods, and shall therby
obtaine new benefits and greater
fauours at their bountifull hands,
and the accusation of Prometheus
their Authour and Master, (though
bitter and vehement) will conduce
more to their profit, then to be effuse
in the congratulation of his inuention:
for in a word, the opinion
of hauing inough, is to be accounted
one of the greatest causes of hauing
too little.
               Now as touching the kind of gift
which men are said to haue receiued
in reward of their accusation (to wit,

                     〈1 page missing〉
                  
                  
                     〈1 page missing〉
                  
                  
hauing the vse of that celestiall fire,
and of so many arts, are not able to
get vnto themselues such things as
Nature it selfe bestowes vpon many
other creatures.
               But that sudden reconciliation
of men to Prometheus, after they
were frustrated of their hopes, containes
a profitable and wise note,
shewing the leuity and temerity of
men in new experiments: for if they
haue not present successe answerable
to their expectation, with too suddaine
haste desist from that they beganne,
and with precipitancy returning
to their former experiments
are reconciled to them againe.
               The state of man in respect of
Arts, and such things as concerne
the intellect, being now described,
the parable passeth to Religion: For
after the planting of Arts followes
the setting of diuine principles,
which hypocrisie hath ouerspread
and polluted. By that twofold Sacrifice
therefore is elegantly shadowed
out, the persons of a true religious

man and an hypocrite. In
the one is contained fatnes, which
(by reason of the inflamation and
fumes thereof) is called the portion
of God, by which his affection and
zeale (tending to Gods glory, and
ascending towards heauen) is signified.
In him also are contained the
bowels of charity, and in him is
founde that good and wholsome
flesh. Whereas in the other, there is
nothing but dry and naked bones,
which neuerthelesse doe stuffe vp
the hide, and make it appeare like
a faire and goodly sacrifice: By this
may well be meant those externall
and vaine rites, and emptie Ceremonies
by which men doe oppresse
and fill vp the sincere worshippe of
God, things composed rather for
ostentation then any way conducing
to true piety. Neither doe they
hold it sufficiēt to offer such mock-sacrifices
vnto God, except they also
lay them before him, as if he had
chosen and bespoke them. Certainly
the Prophet in the person of God,

doth thus expostulate concerning
this choise. Esa. 58. 5. Num tandem
hoc est illud ieiunium, quod ELEGI, vt
homo animam suam in diem vnum
affligat, &amp; caput instar iunceae demittat?
Is it such a fast, that I haue chosen,
that a man should afflict his
soule for a day, and to bow downe
his head like a Bull-rush?
               Hauing now toucht the state of
Religion, the parable conuerts it
selfe to the manners and conditions
of humane life. And it is a common,
but apt, interpretation, by Pandora
to be meant pleasure &amp; voluptuousnes,
which (when the ciuill life is
pampered with too much Arte, and
culture, and superfluitie) is ingendred,
as it were, by the efficacy of
fire, and therefore the worke of voluptuousnes
is attributed vnto Vulcan,
who also himselfe doth represent
fire. From this doe infinite miseries,
together with too late repentance,
proceed and ouerslowe the
minds, and bodies, and fortunes of
men, and that not onely in respect

of particular estates, but euen ouer
kingdomes and common-wealthes:
for from this fountaine haue wars,
and tumults, and tyrannies deriued
their originall.
               But it would bee worth the labour,
to consider how elegantly and
proportionably this Fable doth deliniate
two conditions, or (as I may
say) two tables or examples of humane
life, vnder the persons of Prometheus
and Epimetheus: for they
that are of Epimetheus his sect, are
improuident, not foreseeing what
may come to passe hereafter, esteeming
that best which seemes most
sweete for the present; whence it
happens that they are ouertaken
with many miseries, difficulties and
calamities, and so leade their owne
liues almost in perpetuall affliction,
but yet notwithstanding they please
their fancy, and out of ignorance
of the passages of things, doe entertaine
many vaine hopes in their
mind, whereby they sometimes(as
with sweet dreames) solace themselues,

and sweeten the miseries of
their life. But they that are Prometheus
his schollers, are men endued
with prudence, foreseeing things to
come warily, shunning and auoyding
many euils and misfortunes.
But to these their good properties
they haue this also annexed, that
they depriue themselues, and defraud
their Genius of many lawfull
pleasures, and diuers recreations,
and (which is worse) they vexe and
torment themselues with cares and
troubles and intestine feares: For
beeing chained to the pillar of necessitie,
they are afflicted with innumerable
cogitations (which because
they are very swift, may bee fitly
compared to an Eagle) and those
griping, and, as it were, gnawing
and deuouring the liuer, vnlesse
sometimes, as it were by night, it
may bee they get a little recreation
and ease of mind, but so, as that they
are againe suddenly assaulted with
fresh anxieties and feares.
               Therefore this benefit happens

to but a very few of either condition,
that they should retaine the
commodities of prouidence, and
free themselues from the miseries of
care and perturbation; neither indeed
can any attaine vnto it, but by
the assistance of Hercules, that is,
fortitude, and constancie of minde,
which is prepared for euery euent,
and armed in all fortunes, foreseeing
without feare, enioying without
loathing, and suffering without impatience.
It is worth the noting also,
that this vertue was not naturall to
Prometheus, but aduentitiall, &amp; from
the indulgence of another: for no
in-bred and naturall fortitude is able
to encounter with these miseries.
Moreouer this vertue was receiued
and brought vnto him from
the remotest parte of the Ocean, and
from the Sunne, that is, from wisedome
as from the Sunne, and from
the meditation of inconstancie, or
of the waters of humane life, as from
the sailing vpon the Ocean, which
two Virgill hath well conioyned in
these verses.

                     〈1 page missing〉

and betweene the Oracles of
sense, and the mysteries of faith, vnlesse
an hereticall religion, and a
commentitious philosophy be pleasing
vnto vs.
               Lastly, it remaines that wee say
something of the games of Prometheus
performed with burning torches,
which againe hath reference
to arts and sciences, as that fire, in
whose memory and celebration,
these games were instituted, and it
containes in it a most wise admonition,
that the perfection of sciences
is to be expected from succession,
not from the nimblenesse and
promptnes of one onely authour:
for they that are nimblest in course,
and strongest in contention, yet
happily haue not the lucke to keepe
fire still in their torch; seeing it
may be as well extinguished by running
too fast, as by going too slowe.
And this running and contending
with lampes, seemes long since to
be intermitted, seeing all sciences
seeme euen now to flourish most in

their first Authours, Aristotle, Galene,
Euclid and Ptolomie, succession
hauing neither effected, nor almost
attempted any great matter. It were
therefore to bee wished, that these
games in honour of Prometheus or
humane nature were again restored,
&amp; that matters should receiue successe
by combate and emulation, &amp;
not hang vpon any one mans sparkling
and shaking torch. Men therefore
are to bee admonished to rouse
vp their spirits, &amp; trie their strengths
and turnes, and not referre all to the
opinions and braines of a few.
               And thus haue I deliuered that
which I thought good to obserue
out of this so wel knowen and common
Fable; and yet I will not denie
but that there may bee some things
in it, which haue an admirable consent
with the mysteries of christian
religion, and especially that sailing
of Hercules in a Cuppe (to set Prometheus
at libertie) seemes to represent
an image of the diuine Word
comming in flesh as in a fraile vessell

to redeeme Man from the slauery of
Hell. But I haue interdicted my
penne all liberty in this kinde, lest
I should vse strange fire at the altar
of the Lord.
            
            
               27.
               SCYLLA AND ICARVS, or the
Middle-way.
               MEdiocrity or the Middle-way
is most commended in morall
actions, in contemplatiue sciences
not so celebrated, though no
lesse profitable and commodious:
But in politicall imployments to be
vsed with great heed and iudgement.
The Ancients by the way
prescribed to Icarus, noted the mediocrity
of manners: and by the
way betweene Scylla and Charybdis
(so famous for difficulty and danger)
the mediocritie of intellectuall
operations.
               
                  Icarus being to crosse the sea by
flight, was commanded by his Father
that hee should flie neither too

high nor too lowe; for his wings
being ioynd with waxe, if he should
mount too high, it was to be feared
lest the waxe, would melt by the
heat of the Sunne; and If too lowe,
least the mistie vapours of the Sea
would make it lesse tenacious: But
he in a youthfull iollitie soaring too
high, fell downe headlong and perished
in the water.
               The parable is easie and vulgar:
for the way of vertue lies in a direct
path betweene excesse and defect.
Neither is it a wonder that Icarus
perished by Excesse, seeing that Excesse,
for the most part, is the peculiar
fault of youth, as Defect is of
age, and yet of too euill and hurtfull
waies, youth commonly makes
choise of the better, defect being alwaies
accounted worst: for whereas
excesse containes some sparkes of
magnanimitie, &amp; like a bird claimes
kindred of the Heauens, defect
onely like a base worme crawles
vpon the earth. Excellently therefore

said Heraclitus, Lumen siccum
optima anima. A drie light is the best
soule: for if the soule contract moisture
from the earth it becomes degenerate
altogether. Againe on the
other side, there must be moderation
vsed, that this light be subtilized
by this laudable siccity, and not destroyed
by too much feruency. And
thus much euery man, for the most
part, knowes.
               Now they that would saile betweene
Scylla &amp; Charybdis must be
furnished, as well with the skill, as
prosperous successe of nauigation:
for if their shippes fall into Scylla
they are split on the Rocks: if into
Charybdis they are swallowed vp of
a Gulfe.
               The morall of this parable (which
we will but briefly touch, although
it containe matter of infinite contemplation)
seemes to be this, that
in euery Art and Science, and so in
their rules and Axiomes, there bee a
meane obserued betweene the rocks

of distinctions and the gulfes of
vniuersalities, which two are famous
for the wracke both of wittes and
artes.
            
            
               28.
               SPHINX, or Science.
               THey say that Sphinx was a
monster of diuers formes, as
hauing the face and voice of a virgine,
the wings of a bird, and the talents
of a Griphin. His abode was
in a mountaine neere the Citie of
Thebes, he kept also the high waies,
and vsed to lie in ambush for travellers,
and so to surprize them; to
whom (being in his power) he propounded
certaine darke and intricate
riddles, which were thought to
haue bene giuen and receiued of the
Muses. Now if these miserable captiues
were not able instantly to resolue
and interprete them in the
middest of their difficulties and

                     〈1 page missing〉
                  
                  
                     〈1 page missing〉
                  
                  
vnto it for its gratious countenance
and volubilitie of tongue. Wings
are added because Sciences and
their inuentions, doe passe and flie
from one to another, as it were in a
moment, seeing that the communication
of Science is as the kindling
of one light at another. Elegantly
also is it fained to haue sharpe and
hooked talents, because the Axioms
and arguments of Science doe so
fasten vpon the mind, and so strongly
apprehend and hold it, as that it
cannot stirre or euade, which is noted
also by the diuine Philosopher.
Eccl. 12. 11. Verba sapientum (saith
he) sunt tanquam aculei &amp; veluti claui
in altum defixi. The words of the
wise are like goads, and like nailes
driuen farre in.
               Moreouer, all Science seemes to
be placed in steepe and high mountaines:
as being thought to be a loftie
and high thing, looking downe
vpon ignorance with a scornefull
eye. It may bee obserued and seene

also a great way, and farre in compasse,
as things set on the toppes of
mountaines.
               Furthermore, Science may well
be fained to besette the high waies,
because which way so euer we turne
in this progresse and pilgrimage of
humane life, wee meete with some
matter or occasion offered for contemplation.
               
                  Sphinx is saide to haue receiued
from the Muses diuers difficult
questions and riddles, and to propound
them vnto men, which remaining
with the Muses are free (it
may be) from sauage cruelty: for
so long as there is no other ende of
studie and meditation, then to
know; the vnderstanding is not
rackt and imprisoned, but enioyes
freedome and libertie, and euen in
doubts and variety findes a kind of
pleasure and delectation: but when
once these Aenigmaes are deliuered
by the Muses to Sphinx, that is, to
practise, so that it bee sollicited and

vrged by action, and election, and
determination; then they beginne
to be troublesome and raging; and
vnlesse they be resolued and expedited,
they doe wonderfully torment
and vexe the minds of men, distracting,
and in a manner rending
them into sundry parts.
               Moreouer there is alwaies a twofold
condition propounded with
Sphinx her Aenigmaes; To him that
doth not expound them, distraction
of minde, and to him that doth, a
kingdome: for he that knowes that
which he sought to knowe, hath attained
the end he aimed at, and euery
artificer also commands ouer his
worke.
               Of Sphinx her riddles, there are
generally two kinds; some concerning
the nature of things, others
touching the nature of Man. So
also there are two kindes of Emperies,
as rewards to those that resolue
them: the one ouer nature, the other
ouer men; for the proper and

chiefe end of true naturall philosophy
is to command and sway ouer
naturall beeings, as bodies, medicines,
mechanicall workes, and infinite
other things; although the
schoole (being content with such
things as are offered, and pryding
it selfe with speeches) doth neglect
realties, and workes, treading them,
as it were, vnder foote. But that
Aenigma propounded to Oedipus
(by meanes of which hee obtained
the Thebane Empire) belonged to
the nature of man: For whosoeuer
doth throughly consider the nature
of man, may be, in a manner,
the contriuer of his owne fortune,
and is borne to command,
which is wel spoken of the Romane
Arts.
               
                  Tu regere imperio populos, Romane
memento:
                  Hae tibi erunt artes.—
               
               
                  
                  Romane remember that with
scepters awe
                  Thy Realmes thou rule. These
arts let be thy lawe.
               
               It was therefore very apposit, that
Augustus Caesar (whether by premeditation
or by chance) bare a Sphinx
in his Signet: for hee (if euer any)
was famous not onely in politicall
gouernment, but in all the course of
his life; he happily discouered many
new Aenigmaes concerning the
nature of Man, which if he had not
done with dexteritie and promptnesse,
he had oftentimes fallen into
imminent danger and destruction.
               Moreouer it is added in the Fable,
that the body of Sphinx when
shee was ouercome was laide vpon
an Asse: which indeed is an elegant
fiction, seeing there is nothing so
accute and abstruse, but (beeing
well vnderstood and diuulged)
may be apprehended by a slowe capacitie.
               
                  Neither is it to be omitted, that
Sphinx was ouercome by a Man
lame in his feet: for when men are
too swift of foot and too speedy of
pace in hasting to Sphinx her Aenigmaes,
it comes to passe that (shee
getting the vpper hand) their wits
and mindes are rather distracted by
disputations, then that euer they
come to command by workes and
effects.
            
            
               16.
               PROSERPINA, or Spirit.
               
                  PLuto they say, being made king
of the infernall dominions (by
that memorable diuision) was in
despaire of euer attaining any one
of the superiour Goddesses in mariage,
especially if he should venter
to court them either with words or
with any amorous behauiour, so
that of necessitie he was to lay some
plot to get one of them by rapine,

taking therefore the benefit of opportunitie,
he caught vp Proserpina
(the daughter of Ceres, a beautifull
virgine) as shee was gathering Narcissus
flowers in the meadowes of
Sicily, and caried her away with
him in his Coach to the Subterranean
dominions, where shee was
welcomed with such respect, as that
shee was stiled the Lady of Dis. But
Ceres her mother, when in no place
shee could finde this her onely beloued
daughter, in a sorrowfull humour
and distracted beyond measure,
went compassing the whole
earth with a burning torch in her
hand, to seeke and recouer this her
lost child. But when shee saw that
all was in vaine, supposing peraduenture
that she was caried to Hell,
shee importuned Iupiter with many
teares and lamentations, that shee
might be restored vnto her again, &amp;
at length preuailed thus farre, That
if she had tasted of nothing in Hell,
shee should haue leaue to bring her

from thence. Which condition was
as good as a deniall to her petition,
Proserpina hauing already eaten
three graines of a Pome-granat. And
yet for all this, Ceres gaue not ouer
her suite, but fell to prayers and
moanes afresh. Wherefore it was at
last granted, that (the yeere being
diuided) Proserpina should by alternate
courses, remaine one sixe moneths
with her husband, and other
six moneths with her mother. Not
long after this Theseus and Perithous
in an ouer hardy aduenture
attempted to fetch her from Plutos
bed, who being wearie with trauell
and sitting downe vpon a stone in
Hell to rest themselues, had not the
power to rise againe, but sate there
for euer. Proserpina therefore remained
Queene of Hell, in whose honour
there was this great priuiledge
granted, That although it were enacted
that none that went downe to
Hell should haue the power euer to
returne from thence, yet was this

singular exception annexed to this
law, that if any presented Proserpina
with a golden bough, it should bee
lawfull for him to come and goe at
his pleasure. Now there was but
one onely such bough in a spacious
and shady groue, which was not a
plant neither of it selfe, but budded
from a tree of another kinde, like a
rope of Gumme, which beeing
pluckt of another would instantly
spring out.
               This Fable seemes to pertaine to
nature, and to diue into that rich
and plentifull efficacy and variety
of subalternall creatures, from
whom whatsoeuer wee haue is
deriued, and to them doth againe
returne.
               By Proserpina the Auncients
meant that aethereall spirite which
(beeing separated from the vpper
globe) is shut vp and detained vnder
the earth (represented by Pluto)
which the Poet well expressed
thus.
               
                  
                  Siue recens tellus, seducta
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      nuper
ab alto
                  Aethere, cognati retinebat semina
coeli.
               
               
                  Whither the youngling Tellus
(that of late
                  Was from the high-reard Aether
seperate)
                  Did yet containe her teeming
wombe within
                  The liuing seeds of Heauen, her
neerest kin.
               
               This spirit is fained to be rapted
by the Earth, because nothing can
with-hold it when it hath time and
leasure to escape. It is therefore
caught and stayed by a sudden contraction,
no other wise then if a
man should goe about to mixe ayre
with water, which can be done by
no meanes, but by a speedy and rapid
agitation, as may bee seene in
froth, wherein the ayre is rapted by
the water.
               
                  Neither is it inelegantly added
that Proserpina was rapte as shee was
gathering Narcissus Flowers in the
valleyes, because Narcissus hath his
name from slownesse or stupiditie:
for indeed then is this Spirit most
prepared and fitted to be snatcht by
terrestiall matter, when it beginnes
to be coagulated, and becomes as it
were slowe.
               Rightly is Proserpina honoured
more then any of the other Gods
bed-fellowes, in beeing styled the
Lady of Dis, because this spirit doth
rule and swaye all things in those
lower Regions, Pluto abiding stupid
and ignorant.
               This Spirit the power celestiall
(shadowed by Ceres) striues with
infinite sedulity to recouer and get
againe: for that brand or burning
torch of Aether (which Ceres caried
in her hand) doth doubtles signifie
the Sunne, which enlightneth the
whole circuit of the Earth, and
would bee of greatest moment to

recouer Proserpina, if possibly it
might be.
               But Proserpina abides still, the
reason of which is accuratly and excellently
propounded in the conditions
betweene Iupiter and Ceres:
For first it is most certaine there are
two waies to keepe Spirit in solid
and terrestriall Matter; the one by
constipation or obstruction, which
is meere imprisonment and constraint;
the other by administration
of proportionable nutriment, which
it receiues willingly and of its owne
accord: for after that the included
Spirit beginnes to feed and nourish
it selfe, it makes no haste to be gone,
but is, as it were, linckt to its Earth:
And this is pointed at by Proserpina
her eating of a Pome granat; which
if shee had not done, shee had long
since beene recouered by Ceres
with her torch, compassing the
Earth. Now as concerning that Spirit
which is in Mettals and minerals,
it is chiefly perchance restrained by

the solidity of Masse: but that which
is in Plants and Animals, inhabites
a porous body, and hath open passage
to bee gone in a manner as it
lists, were it not that it willingly abides
of its owne accord, by reason
of the relish it finds in its entertainment.
The second condition concerning
the six moneths custome, it
is no other then an elegant description
of the diuision of the yeere, seeing
this Spirit mixt with the Earth
appeares aboue ground in vegetable
bodies during the summer months,
and in the winter sinkes downe
againe.
               Now as concerning Theseus, and
Perithous their attempt to bring
Proserpina quite away; the meaning
of it is, that it oftentimes comes to
passe, that some more subtill spirits
descēding with diuers bodies to the
Earth, neuer come to sucke of any
subalternall Spirit, whereby to vnite
it vnto them, and so to bring it away.
But on the contrary are coagulated

themselues and neuer rise more,
that Proserpina should bee by that
meanes augmented with inhabitants
and dominion.
               All that wee can say concerning
that sprig of gold is hardly able to
defend vs from the violence of the
Chymicks, if in this regarde they set
vpon vs, seeing they promise by that
their Elixar to effect golden mountaines,
and the restoring of naturall
bodies, as it were, from the portall
of Hell. But concerning Chymistry,
and those perpetuall sutors for
that philosophicall Elixar, wee
know certainly that their Theory is
without grounds, &amp; we suspect that
their practise also is without certaine
reward. And therefore (omitting
these) of this last part of the parable
this is my opinion. I am induced
to beleeue by many figures
of the Ancients, that the conseruation
and restauration of naturall
bodies in some sorte was not esteemed
by them as a thing impossible

                     〈1 page missing〉

Coronets. So as euer since that
time all the Muses haue attired them
selues with plumed heads, except
Terpsichores onely that was mother
to the Sirenes. The habitation of the
Sirenes was in certaine pleasant
Ilands, from whence as soone as
out of their watch-tower they discouered
any ships approching, with
their sweet tunes they would first
entice and stay them, and hauing
them in their power would destroy
them. Neither was their song plaine
and single, but consisting of such variety
of melodious tunes, so fitting
and delighting the eares that heard
them, as that it rauished and betrayed
all passengers. And so great was
the mischiefe they did, that these
Iles of the Sirenes, euen as farre off
as a man could ken them, appeared
all ouer white with the bones of
vnburied Carcases. For the remedying
of this miserie, a double meanes
was at last found out, the one by
Vlisses, the other by Orpheus. Vlisses
                  
(to make experiment of his deuice)
caused all the eares of his companie
to bee stopt with waxe, and
made himselfe to be bound to the
maine Mast, with speciall commandement
to his Mariners not to bee
loosed, albeit himselfe should require
them so to doe. But Orpheus
neglecting and disdaining to be so
bound, with a shrill and sweet voice
singing the praises of the Gods to
his Harpe, supprest the songs of the
Sirenes, and so freed himselfe from
their danger.
               This Fable hath relation to mens
manners, and containes in it a manifest
and most excellent Parable:
For pleasures doe for the most part
proceed out of the abundance and
superfluitie of all things, and also
out of the delights and Iouiall contentments
of the minde; the which
are wont suddenly, as it were, with
winged entisements to rauish and
rapt mortall men. But learning and
education brings it so to passe, as

that it restraines and bridles mans
mind, making it so to consider the
ends and euents of things, as that it
clippes the wings of pleasure. And
this was greatly to the honour and
renowne of the Muses: for after that
by some examples it was made manifest
that by the power of philosophy
vaine pleasures might growe
contemptible; it presently grew to
great esteeme, as a thing that could
raise and eleuate the mind aloft that
seemed to be base and fixed to the
earth; and make the cogitations of
men (which doe euer recide in the
head) to be aethereall, and as it were
winged. But that the Mother of the
Sirenes was left to her feet and without
wings; that no doubt is no
otherwise meant, then of light and
superficiall learning, appropriated
and defined onely to pleasures, as
were those which Petronius deuoted
himselfe vnto, after he had receiued
his fatall sentence, and hauing his
foot, as it were, vpon the threshold

of death sought to giue himselfe all
delightfull contentments, in so
much as when he had caused consolatory
letters to be sent him, hee
would peruse none of them as Tacitus
reports) that should giue him
courage and constancie, but onely
reade fantasticall verses, such as
these are.

                     
                        Viuamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus,
                        Rumoresque Senium Seueriorum,
                        Omnes vnius aestimemus Assis.
                     
                     
                        My Lesbia, let vs liue and
loue;
                        Though wayward Dottards
vs reproue,
                        Weigh their words light for
our behoue.
                     
                     
And this also;

                        Iura Senes nôrint, &amp; quid sit fasque
nefasque
                        Inquirant tristes, legumque examina
seruent.
                     
                     
                        Let doting Grandsires know the
lawe,
                        And right and wrong obserue
with awe:
                        Let them in that stricte circle
drawe.
                     
                  
               
               This kind of doctrine wold easily
perswade to take these plumed Coronets
from the Muses, &amp; to restore
the wings again to the Sirens. These
Sirenes are saide to dwell in remote
Iles, for that pleasures loue priuacie
and retired places, shunning alwaies
too much companie of people. The
Sirenes songs are so vulgarly vnderstood
together with the deceits and
danger of them, as that they need
no exposition. But that of the bones

appearing like white cliffes; and descryed
a farre off, hath more acutenesse
in it: For thereby is signified,
that albeit the examples of afflictions
be manifest and eminent; yet
doe they not sufficiently deterre vs
from the wicked enticements of
pleasures.
               As for the remainder of this parable,
though it be not ouer mysticall,
yet is it very graue and excellent:
For in it are set out three remedies
for this violent enticing mischiefe;
to wit, two from Philosophy,
and one from Religion. The
first meanes to shunne these inordinate
pleasures is, to withstand and
resist them in their beginnings, and
seriously to shunne all occasions
that are offered to debaush &amp; entice
the mind, which is signified in that
stopping of the Eares; &amp; that remedie
is properly vsed by the meaner
and baser sorte of people, as it were,
Vlisses followers or Marriners;
whereas more heroique and noble

Spirits, may boldly conuerse euen
in the midst of these seducing pleasures,
if with a resolued constancie
they stand vpon their guard, and
fortefie their minds; And so take
greater contentment in the triall
and experience of this their approued
vertue; learning rather throughly
to vnderstand the follies and vanities
of those pleasures by contemplation,
then by submission. Which
Salomon auouched of himselfe,
when hee reckoning vp the multitude
of those solaces and pleasures
wherein he swamme, doth conclude
with this Sentence;
               
                  Sapientia quoque perseuerauit mecum.
               
               
                  Wisedome also continued with
mee.
               
               Therefore these Heroes, and Spirits
of this excellent temper, euen
in the midst of these enticing pleasures,
can shew themselues constant

and inuincible, and are able to support
their owne vertuous inclination,
against all headdy and forcible
perswasions whatsoeuer; as by the
example of Vlisses that so peremptorily
interdicted all pestilent counsels
and flatteries of his companions, as
the most dangerous and pernicious
poisons to captiuate the mind. But
of all other remedies in this case,
that of Orpheus is most predominant:
For they that chaunt and resound
the praises of the Gods, confounde
and dissipate the voices and
incantations of the Sirenes; for diuine
meditations doe not onely in
power subdue all sensuall pleasures;
but also farre exceed them in sweetnesse
and delight.
               FINIS.
